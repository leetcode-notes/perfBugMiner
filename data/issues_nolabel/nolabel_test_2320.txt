examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb image normalization is not equal to Udacity video

Hi,
This is just a minor thing, but it might be confusing for people who follow the Udacity course. The video about normalization of the input (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mxNQA95mYE) describes the normalization as: pixel_value - 128 / 128. However the code seems to compute: pixel_value - 128 / 255 (since pixel_depth = 255). This changes the range of the data from -1 to 1 into -0.5 to 0.5 and might be confusing for people who blindly copy the function and expect it to work like in the video.
