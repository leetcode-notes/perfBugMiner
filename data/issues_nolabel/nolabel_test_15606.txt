Fix issue #15588 by simplifying the code

The allocator.h code tried to be clever and use 32 byte alignment for SSE/AVX2/etc use,
and 64 byte alignment for AVX512.
Unfortunately, the #ifdef in use (from EIGEN) is not useful; the bazel BUILD files do
not propagate the tf_copts() compiler flags when the allocator.cc/allocator.h files get
compiled, to EIGEN does not see the actual AVX512 using compiler flags...
Rather than changing compiler flag propagation throughout a whole bunch of code,
there's an opportunity to just simplify the code and always use 64 byte alignment.
Yes it wastes a bit of space, but on the other hand now these allocations are
cache line aligned which isn't a bad thing... and an ifdef can be dropped
