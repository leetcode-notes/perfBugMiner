dataset with tf.pyfunc error

The new IO API is awesome, but I found this error in my project.

I tried to get some index from dataset, then make a batch index,
given the batch index, I got the features from memory which used tf.py_func API, but I found this error.
Invalid argument: Shapes of all inputs must match: values[0].shape = [4096] != values[3].shape = [4096,41]
