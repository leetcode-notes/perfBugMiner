Adding tf.image.non_max_suppression_with_overlaps

This commit introduces the op tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps.
It allows to perform non-max-suppression with an overlap criterion different to IOU by providing an n-by-n matrix with precomputed overlap values for each box pair.
In this way it is possible to use a custom overlap criterion for NMS (eg. intersection-over-area) without implementing a specialized op.
There are currently no unit tests. If you are willing to integrate this pull request, I will copy and rewrite the existing unit tests for NonMaxSuppressionV2.
