Tensorflow 0.12 on Windows - TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dense_shape' running example

I downloaded the latest Windows native version of Tensorflow and having problems running some examples. I have Windows 10 (TF 0.12) with python 3.5.2.
The issue is with keyword dense_shape while running the wide_n_deep_tutorial shipped with the package. I pulled the latest version of TF as well but still didn't resolve the problem:
TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dense_shape'
Specifically, the issue is in the following section:
categorical_cols = {
k: tf.SparseTensor(
indices=[[i, 0] for i in range(df[k].size)],
values=df[k].values,
dense_shape=[df[k].size, 1])
for k in CATEGORICAL_COLUMNS}
Per documentation SparseTensor does not seem to understand dense_shape but IndexedSlices does. But I would like examples to work as is, without modification.
Cannot comment whether this happens on Unix also. Any ideas on how to resolve? Thanks!
