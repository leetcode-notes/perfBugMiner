Tensorboard is down after upgrading the tensorflow?

Hello everyone:
I meet a issue about tensorboard after upgrading the tensorflow. It runs nicely before, but I want maintain some Python2.7 codes in Python3.4. That is why I install tensorflow .whl file of Python 3.4 and modify some grammer from Python2.7 to Python3.4. Then codes still run fine, but tensorboard is donw. The error message as following:

OS Platform: Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from: pip instll .whl file
TensorFlow version: tensorflow 1.2.1 for Python2, but can not check the version for Python 3
What should I do for this issue? degrade tensorflow or upgrade CUDA?
Can anybody give me any help? Thank you!
