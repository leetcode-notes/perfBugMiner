Allows running "-m tensorflow.tensorboard"

This is a suggested change that moves the main entry point of Tensorboard from tensorboard.py to __main__.py, allowing tensorboard to be run as a package:
python -m tensorflow.tensorboard --logdir=/path

This can be really useful on environments with multiple versions of python. Of course, virtualenv is a much better way of dealing with this, but I still find this option to be useful at times.
For instance, if you maintain both Python 2 and Python 3 and do a pip install --user install of tensorflow for both versions. The python files will be neatly separated by the version in ~/.local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages. However, there is no such mechanism for ~/.local/bin, so the second pip install will override the first one. You can also get around this by running the tensorboard.py file directly, but this is not nearly as convenient and safe as letting python specify the location of the package.
Another less drastic option here is to keep tensorboard.py and add a new file for __main__.py that simply imports main from tensorboard.py and runs it. I'm happy to arrange such a PR too.
