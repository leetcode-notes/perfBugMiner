Code Cleanup for Makefile iOS Build

Just cleanup the coding of Makefile iOS Build, should be reducing maintenance effort.
The Makefile part is skipped for the moment, I will finish it later (not in this PR).
I am planning to add automatic Selective Registration to Makefile build by only specifying the graph file path, to both Android and iOS (I think the biggest usage of this Makefile is custom building). Once I finish the coding, will raise a PR.
