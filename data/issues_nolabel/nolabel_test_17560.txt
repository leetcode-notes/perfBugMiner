sess.run() returns invisible string for a tf.summary.merge_all() op.

HI,
I have a problem to read the outpur of sess.run:
here is the code:
tf.summary.scalar('Loss', loss) tf.summary.scalar('Accuracy', accuracy) write_op = tf.summary.merge_all() summary_train = sess.run(write_op, feed_dict=feed_dict_train)
where, write_op is a op from tf.summary.merge_all().
The output summary_train is something like: \n\nLoss??\n\nAccuracy?????
Do you have any idea how I can get the numbers for the loss and accuracy from summary_train
Look forward to your response
Hao
