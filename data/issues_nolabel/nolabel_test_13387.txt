ERROR: Failed to import the TensorFlow module.

I was trying to install tensorflow-gpu. Using the tensorflow self check, it says all the required DLLs are present, but I still have an import error. I get the same error if I try to import numpy. There seems to be an issue with my conda command as well. Any help is greatly appreciated to resolve this issue. Thanks!
