Using Linear Algebraic Functions In TensorFlow Python

Hey TF,
Matrix norm in python, it doesn't appear the documentation. However, in your Eigen section, there is a matrix norm function.
Is it possible to use these eigen functions via python and ensure that it is performed on the gpu? These linear algebraic functions are very easy to do in theano, but I'm having difficulty figuring out how to do this in python.
My ultimate goal is to perform a euclidean norm.  I just don't know what is the best way to do this in python would be. Thanks!
