ImportError: No module named nets, r0.12

I am trying to run resnet_v2.py  from provided modles but getting error ImportError: No module named nets.
I have done following
First installing slim
cd $HOME/tensorflow git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models/
To verify that this has worked, execute the following commands; it should run
without raising any errors.
`cd $HOME/tensorflow/models/slim
python3 -c "from nets import cifarnet; mynet = cifarnet.cifarnet"`

I got no error.
But when I run following gives error "ImportError: No module named nets". I have also tried
cd $HOME/tensorflow/models/slim/ python3 -c "from nets import resnet_utils"
Got not error.  Also build  using bazel build nets output
INFO: Found 1 target... Target //slim:nets up-to-date (nothing to build) INFO: Elapsed time: 0.096s, Critical Path: 0.00s
I don't know why this is not working.
