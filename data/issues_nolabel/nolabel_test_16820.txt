why tfdbg dumps so much things out

I was running a very small network(only 1 million parameters), everything is right with the training process, then I tried tfdbg, when I get a tfdbg -> run, it dumps so many things out, then root directory is filled, before run, there is 11G left, with a run, quickly fills all the space and prompts no space left:

How to make it work?
