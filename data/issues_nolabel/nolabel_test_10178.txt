Setter for Tensor.shape?

tensor.shape is equivalent to tensor.get_shape() in TF 1.0 (see #586).
Should we also make tensor.shape = new_shape equivalent to tensor.set_shape(new_shape)? This feels natural and results in slightly more idiomatic Python.
This would be straightforwardly done with a setter method, e.g.,
@shape.setter
def shape(self, new_shape):
    self.set_shape(new_shape)
