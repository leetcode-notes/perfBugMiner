Add support for broadcasting shapes.

This PR adds functionality to TensorShape to allow for broadcasting. In particular,

TensorShape.broadcast_with(other) returns the shape resulting from broadcasting a tensor of the given shape with a tensor of shape other. It raises a ValueError if the shapes are not broadcastable.
TensorShape.is_broadcastable_with(other) determines whether two shapes are broadcastable
TensorShape.assert_is_broadcastable_with(other) asserts that two shapes are broadcastable
