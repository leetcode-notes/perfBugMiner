Templatize dtype in RGBToHSV and HSVToRGB

RGBToHSV and HSVToRGB currently work only for float32 inputs. Made the data type a template parameter so that other input types like float16 and float64 can be used. This change is towards resolving #1140 for the above mentioned operations.
This change does not enable float64, as incorporating new types will also need new tests, something I'm not sure about at this point. (Addressed to whoever looks at the PR) Could you explain how the tests in core/kernels/colorspace_op_test.cc can be executed, and how they need to be changed in case float64 is enabled?
