Windows: Make TensorFlow build with Bazel again

rules_closure doesn't work on Windows, since //tensorflow/tensorboard depends on it, we exclude it from dependencies of pip package for now.
Sent bazelbuild/rules_closure#206 to fix one of the rules_closure problems on Windows.


base_rendezvous_mgr needs tf_opts to build correctly.


bazel_test_lib.sh: move run_configure_for_cpu_build function in front of clean_output_base, because we need the correct .bazelrc to be written before running bazel command.


Excluded //tensorflow/python/tools:saved_model_cli_test and //tensorflow/python/feature_column:feature_column_test on Windows.
The reason is test_src_dir_path doesn't work on Windows, because TEST_SRCDIR points to the runfiles directory which doesn't exist on Windows, and besides, we run tests from py_test_dir directory, so org_tensorflow/tensorflow should be org_tensorflow/py_test_dir/tensorflow.
I couldn't find an easy fix for these problem, so skip the tests for now.
