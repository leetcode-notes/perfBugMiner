_LayerRNNCell __call__() method incompatible with tuple of tensors

I'm trying to build a custom LSTM cell that should accept a tuple of tensors in the call method. However, as part of the dynamic_rnn loop, _LayerRNNCell's __call__() method requires that inputs be a 2-D tensor with shape [batch_size, input_size], which is incompatible with a tuple of tensors. Is there a way around this, or can the `call()1 method be expanded to be more flexible?
The error that I receive:
ValueError: Layer action_conditioned_lstm_cell_1 expects 1 inputs, but it received 2 input tensors.
