tf.train.match_filenames_once() under Windows

I use  tf.train.match_filenames_once() as follows:
tf.train.match_filenames_once("./*.py")
I mean , I want to get all the py file in current directory.
But, the result is I also get subdirectory py file under Windows.
How can I get the specified files only in current directory?
Thank you！
