Tensorboard: graph is shown but no scalar data was found

I can see the graph, but no scalar is shown.
Environment info
Mac OS 10.11.4
Anaconda Python 2.7
Tensoflow installed from binary pip package
The output from python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version)": 0.8.0
About the code
I am trying to log values of loss using: tf.scalar_summary('loss',loss)
I have the writer set to a particular folder: summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter(LogDir, sess.graph)
After calling sess.run([optimizer, loss, learning_rate, train_prediction], feed_dict=feed_dict) I do summary_writer.flush()
What have you tried?
I can see a log file called events.out.tfevents.1463159389.Matheuss-MacBook-Pro.local in the folder I set. The file is about 16Mb big.
I call tensorboard --logdir=/Users/mviana/Desktop/tf/log/ --debug and I can verify the log dir is correct.
On the browser I can see the graph corresponding to my deep neural network, but no scalar is shown.
If I call tensorboard --inspect --logdir=/Users/mviana/Desktop/tf/log/ nothing but Starting TensorBoard 16 on port 6006 (You can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:6006) is shown in the terminal.
If I comment the line tf.scalar_summary('loss',loss) the log file size remains unchanged. So, it seems that only the graph is being logged.
