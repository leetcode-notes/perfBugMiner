Fixed random_contrast link in the Deep CNN tutorial

The random_contrast link was pointing to an older location that seems to no longer exist. Fixed it to point to the right location.
I believe the tech report should also really point to http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/conv-cifar10-aug2010.pdf, which is actually a short 9 page report about using convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10. The previously linked document is Krizhevsky's master thesis at 60 pages and is mostly about RBMs instead of convolutional neural networks and doesn't really fit the tutorial.
