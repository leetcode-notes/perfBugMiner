PC cold boots during MNIST example on GPU (GF980Ti); PSU problem; reduce load?

After getting Tensorflow to work at all, now I've got another issue: I can run through the 20.000 training steps (within about 1 second; holy sh... that thing's fast) of the Deep MNIST example (code below). But after the last step my PC does a cold reboot. It just turns off hard without shutdown and reboots after a few seconds.
It appears to be caused by an undersized PSU. Gaming on the GPU however works fine so far...
So, is there any way that I can reduce the load on the GPU during usage of Tensorflow? I'd be fine if the MNIST example took 2 seconds instead of 1 if only my PC wouldn't reboot.
At the moment unfortunately I cannot afford a new PSU, spent my whole available budget on the GF980Ti.
Any ideas?
