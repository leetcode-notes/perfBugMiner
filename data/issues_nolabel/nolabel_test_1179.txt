libcuda suffix issue

For bugs/issues, please fill in the following.  The more information you
provide, the more likely we can help you.
Environment info
Operating System: Centos 7
Cuda 7.5, cuDNN v4
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: 99813c2
Steps to reproduce

Followed "Installing from sources" instructions
./configure - run and cuda version explicitly set to 7.5
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer - runs without issue
bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu - fails (relevant log below) due to an attempt to load libcuda.so.7.5 via tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc.

What have you tried?

Attempting to create a symbolic link of libcuda.so.7.5 pointing at libcuda.so did not work.
Editing tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc line 99 from:

/* static */ port::Status DsoLoader::GetLibcudaDsoHandle(void** dso_handle) {
  return GetDsoHandle(FindDsoPath("libcuda.so" + GetCudaVersion(),
                                  "third_party/gpus/cuda/driver/lib64"),
                      dso_handle);
}
to
/* static */ port::Status DsoLoader::GetLibcudaDsoHandle(void** dso_handle) {
  return GetDsoHandle(FindDsoPath("libcuda.so", // + GetCudaVersion(),
                                  "third_party/gpus/cuda/driver/lib64"),
                      dso_handle);
}
fixed the issue.
3. This naming convention issue also appears to be the case on Ubuntu 14.04 - but I have not attempted to rebuilt everything there.
