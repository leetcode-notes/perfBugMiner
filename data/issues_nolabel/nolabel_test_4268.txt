resize_image_with_crop_or_pad loses channel information

png = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(png_raw, 100, 100)
before:
TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(None), Dimension(3)])

after:
TensorShape([Dimension(100), Dimension(100), Dimension(None)]

tf.image.pad_to_bounding_box has the same problem.
The combination of these two lines seems questionable:
height, width, depth = _ImageDimensions(image, static_only=False)
padded_shape = [None if is_tensor(i) else i
                  for i in [target_height, target_width, depth]]

why set static_only=False? The docs for _ImageDimensions say:

list of integers [batch, height, width, channels], when static shape is
fully defined or static_only is True.
list of integer scalar tensors [batch, height, width, channels], when
static shape is not fully defined.

so unless all dimensions of the image are defined you will get tensors which will then be changed to None.
