CPU kernels for FFT (WIP)

This PR adds CPU kernels for FFTs (cf #386). A few points to note:

This PR does not yet support RFFTs. These can in principle be implemented by slicing such that the negative frequency components of the FFT are removed. Maybe @benoitsteiner has some better ideas though.
Does it make sense to split up the code into multiple files to avoid having #if GOOGLE_CUDA half way?
@rryan, because the tensor FFT in Eigen is templated, I couldn't avoid bloating the binary a bit as discussed via e-mail.
