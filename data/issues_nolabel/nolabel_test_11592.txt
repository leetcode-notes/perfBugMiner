Cross compile TensorFlow for armeabi-v7a failed

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.2.1
Python version:
2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version:
n/a
GPU model and memory:
n/a
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build -c opt tensorflow/core:android_tensorflow_lib --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=armeabi-v7a --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I was able to cross-compile TensorFlow to armeabi-v7a using TensorFlow 1.0. But when I used the same command using TensorFlow 1.2.1, the compilation failed. Please find the detailed error message in the Source code/logs section.
The command I used is as follows:
bazel build -c opt tensorflow/core:android_tensorflow_lib --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=armeabi-v7a --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
