Changed context creation to use primary context

Using cuCtxCreate/Destroy does not give any benefits over using primary context and is not advised by the CUDA documentation: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#multiple-contexts.
Moreover, it breaks interaction with some runtime API calls, like cudaPointerGetAttributes and cudaEnablePeerAccess (see section Context Interoperability in: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__DRIVER.html#group__CUDART__DRIVER).
This PR changes how the context are obtained and released from cuCtxCreate/Destroy to cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain/Release
