TF-Slim can't exclude variables when import data from checkpoint files

I exclude variables that don't exist in the checkpoint file by using the he func
      variables_to_restore = slim.get_variables_to_restore(exclude=exclude_set) 

these variables come from slim.train.MomentumOptimizer() which include  '../momentum:0' in name.But the program seems to still try to find them in the checkpoint.This really confusing me. Anyone can help me?
