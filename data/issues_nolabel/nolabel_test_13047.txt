tf.graph_util.extract_sub_graph should raise a better error message

Hi,
I used tf.graph_util.extract_sub_graph to get a subgraph reaching a particular dest node. My dest_node is say conv2d_transpose_7. I by mistake gave it as a string in the second parameter. Python parses String too as a list and it raised an error AssertionError: c is not in graph. The extract_sub_graph should first check if the second parameter isinstace of a List so that it would be convenient to debug this kind of error in the future. A screenshot is attached.
Thanks,
