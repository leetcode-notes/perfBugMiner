dynamic_rnn error: cannot set initial_state, could before

So, I've come back to my code after a week, I was using dynamic_rnn and have the initial_state parameter set to a tuple, everything was working fine training worked beautifully...
Anyway, now today I get this error:
TypeError: The two structures don't have the same sequence type. First structure has type type 'tuple', while second structure has type class 'tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell.LSTMStateTuple'.
I suspect there was an update somewhere, so If someone could point me to where/how I can make an LSTMStateTuple object I would be greatly appreciated.
