Multil-model restore in tensorflow

I have two model without scope name but they have same variable name, I want load them simultaneously, but it will crash and throw error, which is "Variable XXX already exists".
I notice the issuehttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/3270, but the problem is solved by re-training the model again and save them under different scope.
However, I do not want to re-train them again. So how can I load existing models and save them into two different scope?
Any advise or help will be appreciated!
