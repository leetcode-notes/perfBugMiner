lstm_cell/weights does not exist, fail only using master code, ok for release version 0.12.1

The code like below:
`
for i in range(max_steps):
with tf.variable_scope("RNN", reuse=True if i > 0 else None):
 (output, state) = self.cell(last_symbol, state)

ValueError: Variable seq2seq/decode/RNN/lstm_cell/weights does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
