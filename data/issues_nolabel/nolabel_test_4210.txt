deepdream tutorial rename_nodes error

Hi -
The tensorflow/examples/deepdream README.md says that Python 2.7 is required. However, loading the deepdream.ipynb notebook fires up the 3.5 kernel (due to info I believe is stored in the notebook itself.
But the error I am encountering on the line:
tmp_def = rename_nodes(graph_def, lambda s:"/".join(s.split('_',1)))
may or may not be due to a python version issue. The line generates the error:
TypeError: '<stripped 37632 bytes>' has type <class 'str'>, but expected one of: (<class 'bytes'>,)
I'm running Mac OS X 10.10.5, python 2.7 for the Mac, and 3.5 for everything else.
Best,
- lonce
