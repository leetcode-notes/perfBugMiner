Loaded cudnn library: 4007 but source was compiled against 4004

when I install the tensorflow from souces in my ubuntu14.04 system, a cudnn version does not match  problem happened.
Omit some fine steps, the following is my installation steps:
1.Configure the cuda installation,  CUDA 7.5 and cudnn v4.0.7  have been chosen:
root@node4:/home/zhouzhiqiang/tensor_5_9/tensorflow# ./configure
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]:
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GPU support? [y/N] y
GPU support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Please specify which gcc nvcc should use as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]:
Please specify the Cuda SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]: 7.5
Please specify the location where CUDA 7.5 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify the Cudnn version you want to use. [Leave empty to use system default]: 4.0.7
Please specify the location where cuDNN 4.0.7 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size.
[Default is: "3.5,5.2"]:
Setting up Cuda include
Setting up Cuda lib64
Setting up Cuda bin
Setting up Cuda nvvm
Setting up CUPTI include
Setting up CUPTI lib64
Configuration finished
2. Create the pip package and install
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.8.0-py2-none-any.whl
After the installation, The following example was carried out:
python tensor_5_9/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/alexnet/alexnet_benchmark.py
Log for printing:
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:286] Loaded cudnn library: 4007 but source was compiled against 4004.  If using a binary install, upgrade your cudnn library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded matches the version you specified during compile configuration.

Print notes that cudnn version  does not match, but in reality,  I haven't installed cudnn v4.0.4ï¼Œ and  cudnn v4.0.7 is configured  at installation time. Does anyone know why?
