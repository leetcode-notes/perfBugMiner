Tensorflow llite more support

Hello,
I am using tflite for my development and I used label_image example for inference. Can you please provide more documentation either on tflite and how to use it or provide support for reading PNG and JPEG files for the inference?
Is there any python example available for tflite inference pipeline?
Additionally, tensorflow lite is slow on RaspberryPi. Slower than normal tensorflow graph. I can run MobileNet in 600ms and for same model converted in tflite takes 1300ms for an inference. Is there any solution for this?
