Also taking contributions from the Gerrit?

In my opinion doing code review on GitHub is horrible except for very small fixes / tweaks. In addition, all those merge commits from "pull requests" really clutter up the git log.
I wonder if TensorFlow would consider also taking patches from Gerrit. Blaze (Bazel) does this: all external pull requests are not merged directly, but committed through the Gerrit repo. As a result, their commit history looks much cleaner: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commits/master.
