breakpoints not working in tf_ios_makefile_example

Environment info
Operating System: OS X El Capitan
Xcode v7.3.1
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I'm able to build and the run the tf_ios_makefile_example according to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples but while debugging the app, the breakpoints I set in the app (RunModelViewController.mm even in AppDelegate.mm) doesn't work - NSLog statements next to the breakpoints work fine.
Anyone has the problem? Any solutions or ideas? Thanks!
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I verified new Xcode project or other existing Xcode projects work fine with pause at set breakpoints. I also Googled "xcode 7 breakpoints not working" but didn't see helpful info. I noticed
the line CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG..." in compile_ios_protobuf.sh but am not sure if it's the cause.
