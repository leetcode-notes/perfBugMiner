If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I just run the iris_monitor.py example at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/monitors and got the error

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I ran torch on my GPU successfully before, so I could confirm that GPU computing is possible on my computer.
