Obtain tower id when using tf.contrib.estimator.replicate_model_fn()

Since tensorflow 1.5, a new API tf.contrib.estimator.replicate_model_fn() is introduced to to replicate a model over GPUs. However, the current API hides the tower id information from the model_fn(). Without knowning tower id, it is difficult to create non-shared local variables/ops per tower. Is it possible to propagate the tower id information to model_fn? Thanks.
