Implementation of algorithms like longest commom subsequence and editting distance?

Hi everyone,
I am wondering if there are some shortcuts to implement an new API of algorithms like lcs. Should I implement it from scratch using C++ or C? It seems not efficient to do it in Python.  How can I just get started?
Thanks,
Best,
