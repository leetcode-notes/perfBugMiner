Convert retrained data into .pb format for ios camera example?

I retrained image data using the tutorial at ((https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html)) I did all the steps until bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain. I was wondering how to turn this image training data into a .pb file that I can use in the ios camera example.
Thank you for your help!
