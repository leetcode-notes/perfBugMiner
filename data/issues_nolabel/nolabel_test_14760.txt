fix: tf.contrib.slim.nets.vgg will not work

init.py of slim module don't import nets module. so
tf.contrib.slim.nets.vgg
will not work. change to this:
import tensorflow.contrib.slim.nets as nets
vgg = nets.vgg

another way of correcting this is change init.py. but change documentation is the easy way.
