tf.conv2d ValueError

I believe the following is a bug
ValueError: Shape must be rank 4 but is rank 1 for 'Conv2D' (op: 'Conv2D') with input shapes: [1,1,64,256], [4].

ValueError: Shape must be rank 4 but is rank 1 for 'Conv2D' (op: 'Conv2D') with input shapes: [1,1,64,256], [4].
I believe that a tensor of shape [1,1,64,256] should be Rank 4 not Rank 1.
