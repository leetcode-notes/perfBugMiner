Provide a working way to shut up warnings

These messages appear whenever I run my program.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
Now, I don't care that Tensorflow wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, or AVX, or whatever. I don't want to see these messages. I also don't want to recompile from source to remove the warnings, install something else, play games with stderr, or whatever. I just want a clean way to shut up the warnings.
Here's my initialization code.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import ops
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(device_count = {'GPU': 0}))
See? I asked for no warnings. Yet I still get them. That's a bug. Even if it's the intended behavior, please fix this.
Version is Tensorflow 1.0 on Linux.
Thank you!
