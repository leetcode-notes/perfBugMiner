Add TF_AllocateTensor to version 0.10

Recently there was added a very useful function to the C API—namely, TF_AllocateTensor. Currently the commit is not present on branch r0.10. I’m wondering if it’s possible to cherry-pick the commit to r0.10 so that the function is available already in version 0.10. Thank you.

Ivan
