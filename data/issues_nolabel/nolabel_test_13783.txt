How can I do multples input Api c?

Hi guys,
I am trying to make build my project in c++. The model use CTC and I don't have idea with re-writte code for main.cc. So,  It has input four values: Tensor("the_input:0", shape=(?, 128, 64, 1), dtype=float32) Tensor("the_labels:0", shape=(?, 16), dtype=float32) Tensor("input_length:0", shape=(?, 1), dtype=int64) Tensor("label_length:0", shape=(?, 1), dtype=int64)
I am use https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/label_image/main.cc as model base for new code, however, the input is erro.
Can someone help me?
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
** Linux Ubuntu 16.04**:
TensorFlow installed by git alfer compiling:
TensorFlow 1.3.0:
Python version 3.5:
Bazel version 0.6.1:
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU Titan X pascal 12GB:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I a m triyng create a image ocr mobilie as tensorflow CTC.
