Build iOS sample failed

After I run the tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh command,
I got the messages bellow:
echo 'protoc not found at
~/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf-host/bin/protoc. Build it first.'
protoc not found at ~/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf-host/bin/protoc. Build it first.
I check the protobuf-host directory. This folder contains nothing, how can I solve this?
Do I miss any steps?
Thanks!
