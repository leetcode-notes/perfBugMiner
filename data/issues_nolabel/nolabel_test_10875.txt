how do i retrain net after quantization?

i had used tensorflow tool, quantization_graph.py, to quantize my graph successfully. how do i retrain this net after quantization? since the tool requires using freeze_graph.py to convert variables in graph to constant.
BTW, can i set up my graph using quantize ops, and train from the scratch? if can, is there any example?
