where is the location of grpc library installed by pip

Could you someone can tell me where the grpc c++ lib location?
I can find the python part in site-packages, but cannot find where the grpc installed?
My system is centos 7, and install it by pip over  anaconda
[root@nodel]# pip show tensorflow
