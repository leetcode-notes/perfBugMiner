[XLA] FIX XLA/tfcompile on OSX. #if Guard AVX, SSE and NEON instructions

This fixes XLA / tfcompile on OSX.
On OSX you currently run into linker errors because unsupported
instructions are registered. Add ifdefs to register only the
supported instructions.
Also include PR#14137 changes for missing __sincos/__sincosf in
XLA on macOS since it was closed without a merge.
