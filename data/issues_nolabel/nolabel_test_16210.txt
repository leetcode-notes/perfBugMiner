added CMake options to provide external zlib, GRPC, Eigen

Here are changes necessary to build tensorflow with different version of GRPC, Protobuf, Eigen, zlib, etc. It is not possible to compile project using two different versions of protobuf for example. To deal with that I've chosen approach similar to one in GRPC library. Copy of #14463 (comment)
