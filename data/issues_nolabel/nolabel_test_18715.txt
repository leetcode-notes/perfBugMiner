Support string tensors for `tf.count_nonzero`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #18712 where tf.count_nonzero does not support string tensors.
The reason the string tensor does not work was because tf.count_nonzero uses input_tensor.dtype.as_numpy_dtype() to created a numpy type zero which is passed to tf.not_equal. However, as_numpy_dtype() will convert tf.string to np.object so an exception is thrown.
But passing a numpy type zero to tf.not_equal is unnecessary as we could use tf.zeros instead, which works for tf.string
This fix fixes the issue. This fix fixes #18712.
