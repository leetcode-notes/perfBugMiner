Multiple CPU usage ineffective: CPU utilization only 200% on a 8 core VM

This is the same as #583. Opening a new issue since CPU utilization is still low. I built tensorflow with -mavx2 flag and ran examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py. TensorFlow is recognizing num of cores as 8, yet still only 200% of CPU is used during training.

Steps to reproduce

Enable logging of inter_op_parallelism_threads and intra_op_parallelism_threads.
Configure, build tensorflow with AVX2 with this command
bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx2 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Build wheel, install package and run python examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py.
