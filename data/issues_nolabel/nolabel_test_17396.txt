[WIP] MKL repos download for mac and windows + update to MKL(-DNN) 0.12

This PR implements MKL repos for Mac (tested) and Windows (not tested yet)
As well as reworks MKL.BUILD to support all 3 desktop platforms
Update 1 Unfortunately, because of bazel bug bazelbuild/bazel#4480 you will still experience loader issues on Mac and you will be forced to install MKL globally or deal with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to overcome invalid rpath in generated .so files of tensorflow (similar to #6729 for CUDA libraries in dependencies).
Update 2 Bazel 0.12.0 (not yet released) fixes the issue and it builds and runs flawlessly (verified with 0.12.0rc1 )
