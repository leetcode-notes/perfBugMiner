Why resize_image_with_crop_or_pad require fully defined image?

I would like to ask, why tensorflow.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad require fully defined image? Wouldn't it be better to have some function that is more general and that can handle dynamically created tensor?
I am currently playing with this function and I would like to use it for not fully defined Tensors.
Is there some plan to implement some more complex crop_tensor function that would work with dynamic tensors? And that would possibly be able to handle #2284
