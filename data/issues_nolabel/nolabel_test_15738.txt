System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows  Home
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0 (GPU)
Python version: 3.6
GPU: GTX1050 Ti M (disabled Intel visualization)
Basically any output I try to write in console is with extra symbol : "b"
for example:
with cmmand:
C: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
b'unknown' 1.4.0 //OUTPUT

I downloaded GPU verison form guide from official webiste(with:Anaconda):
