Is Docker image tag "latest-devel-py3" Python2?

I'd like to use Tensorflow with Python3 on Docker.
I set my Dockerfile below then build and run.
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-py3
I entered in a shell on Docker and typed next command.
# python --version
Python 2.7.12

Is the image tag of "latest-devel-py3" Python2?
However, I tried to build and run using "latest-py3".
This response was,
# python --version
Python 3.5.2

Anyway, could anyone describe me about the difference between "latest-devel-py3" and "latest-py3"?
