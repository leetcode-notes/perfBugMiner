[XLA] Add filtering of tests for 3rd party devices on the python suite

Currently the tests are marked with specific exclusions for devices.
For 3rd party devices where we don't want their names and configs in the public repo, this change allows the devices to specify which tests they want to exclude.
No change for the CPU/GPU builtin devices.
