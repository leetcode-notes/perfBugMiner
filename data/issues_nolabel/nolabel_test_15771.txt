Flexible input shape for map method in class RandomFourierFeatureMapper

This is a feature request. In tensorflow r1.4, Class RandomFourierFeatureMapper, map method,
The shape of the input must be, [batch_size, self._output_dim].
There can be scenarios where in each batch there are multiple training point, essentially i'm proposing a scenario where the input shape  must be  [batch_size, x ,self._output_dim].
Which is not possible in current API.
In the matmul we can see that it is mentioned, "The inputs must, following any transpositions, be tensors of rank >= 2 where the inner 2 dimensions specify valid matrix multiplication arguments, and any further outer dimensions match." which is in-fact very flexible.
