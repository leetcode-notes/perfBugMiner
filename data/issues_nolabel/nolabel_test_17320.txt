Require a c++ example or documents about tensorflow lite useage

because i have my own native and c++ code, if i want to use tensorflow lite feature and put it to my android project, i have to write tensorflow lite code in c++.
but it is too hard to find out how to get the input and output.
i have look up the ios example because part of the code is written in c++, but it crashed when i have:
float* output = interpreter->typed_output_tensor(0);
for(int i = 0; i < output_size; i++)
LOGD("bkzero jni: , result: %f", output[i]);
i believe it is not a bug under iOS platform.
this part of code in android example is written in java, i cannot figure out how to write an implemetation of the tensorhandle like:
long[] outputsHandles =
run(interpreterHandle, errorHandle, sizes, dataTypes, numsOfBytes, inputs);
if (outputsHandles == null || outputsHandles.length == 0) {
throw new IllegalStateException("Interpreter has no outputs.");
}
Tensor[] outputs = new Tensor[outputsHandles.length];
for (int i = 0; i < outputsHandles.length; ++i) {
outputs[i] = Tensor.fromHandle(outputsHandles[i]);
Log.i("bkzero: ", "java: outputs[0] " + outputs[i]);
}
