Threading example at programmers_guide/threading_and_queues broken

Dear TF folks,
I am trying to reproduce the example listed at 1,
# Thread body: loop until the coordinator indicates a stop was requested.
# If some condition becomes true, ask the coordinator to stop.
def MyLoop(coord):
  while not coord.should_stop():
    ...do something...
    if ...some condition...:
      coord.request_stop()

# Main thread: create a coordinator.
coord = tf.train.Coordinator()

# Create 10 threads that run 'MyLoop()'
threads = [threading.Thread(target=MyLoop, args=(coord,)) for i in xrange(10)]

# Start the threads and wait for all of them to stop.
for t in threads:
  t.start()
coord.join(threads)

When running this example, I cannot find the threading.Thread class (e.g. by searching for "Thread" in the API docs or tf.threading.Thread).
Am I missing something where? Is the example maybe broken?
Thanks!
