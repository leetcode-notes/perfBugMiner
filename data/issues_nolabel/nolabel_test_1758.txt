Network Surgery: Changing Inputs in existing networks

I am trying to modify an existing graph (inception) loaded using the standard approach
with gfile.FastGFile(os.path.join(
      model_dir, 'classify_image_graph_def.pb'), 'r') as f:
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

The nodes are accessible using the get_tensor_by_name method. Here I try to replace the input to Cast (which is DecodeJpeg) with a tf.Variable with the same contents (allowing it to be used for optimization)
old_cast_node = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('Cast:0')
old_image_input = old_cast_node.op.inputs[0]
tf_new_image = tf.Variable(old_image_input.eval())
old_cast_node.op.inputs[0] = tf_new_image

Results in this error
TypeError: '_InputList' object does not support item assignment

Can the inputlist of an op be modified in any other way?
