Transpose for high dimensional tensors using eigen

In our library we rely heavily on fast transposes of high dimensional tensors, so we have added few extra cases to the CPU and GPU transpose functors. Previously it was done up to dimension 5 and we included dimensions 6, 7, 8 (similarly to the TENSORFLOW_USE_SYCL case).
