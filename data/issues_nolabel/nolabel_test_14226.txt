Exact command to reproduce: Performing resize_images with output of decode_image

Describe the problem
This problem was addressed in #1029 but was closed. #8551 and #9356 are also relevant.
The basic problem is that the output of tf.image.decode_image cannot be passed to tf.image.resize_images. It raises ValueError: 'images' contains no shape. in the call to resize_images.
Possible workarounds to this include using decode_jpeg, decode_png or adding decoded_image.set_shape([None, None, None]) before calling tf.image.resize_images. However, as @girving pointed out in #1029, nothing about the underlying op requires knowing a static shape.
Source code / logs
decoded_image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(tf.read_file(image_filename))
tf.image.resize_images(decoded_image, (100, 100))
