tensorboard fetching sprite image... parsing metadata takes forever

When i study tensorboard embedding, My code refers #6322 @danielgordon10. Whatever my datasets size is(I modify batch_size , epoches and embedding data_szie, but it doesn't works ), localhost:6006#embedding takes forever and the browser  shows always fetching sprite image... parsing metadata. What should i do? Could someone give me any ideas?
