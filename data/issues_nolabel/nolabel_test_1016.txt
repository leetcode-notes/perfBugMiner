Incorrect RNN documentation

In the tensorflow.python.ops.rnn.rnn docs:

Dynamic calculation returns, at time t:
(t >= max(sequence_length)
? (zeros(output_shape), zeros(state_shape))
: cell(input, state)

But if we look at _dynamic_rnn_step, what seems more reasonable is happening: the old state gets passed through unaltered if t >= max(sequence_length).
