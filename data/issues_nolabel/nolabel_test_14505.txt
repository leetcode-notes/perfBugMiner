index_to_string_table_from_file cannot use tf.string as vocabulary file

Running stock tensorflow on macOS I get:
import tensorflow as tf

print (tf.__version__)

with open('test', 'w') as f:
  f.write('hello\n')
  f.write('world\n')
  f.write('!\n')

file_path = tf.constant('test')
#file_path = 'test' # this works

a = tf.constant(['world', 'hello'])

with tf.Session() as sess:
  str2i = tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file(vocabulary_file=file_path)
  sess.run(str2i.init)
  i = str2i.lookup(a)
  print(sess.run(i))

  # Other way doesn't work
  i2str = tf.contrib.lookup.index_to_string_table_from_file(vocabulary_file=file_path)
  sess.run(i2str.init)
  s = i2str.lookup(i)
  print(sess.run(s))

results in:

[b'world' b'hello']

Due to None check at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/lookup_ops.py#L1126
This is an issue because I can't seem to be able to make index_to_string_table_from_file read the vocabulary_file from a GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS collection when storing the graph as a saved_model
