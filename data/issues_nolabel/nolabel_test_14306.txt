Describe the problem
I recently upgraded from 1.4.0-rc0 to 1.4.0-rc1 and found that a number of my model architectures fail to compile. After a bit of a detective work, I tracked the issue down to the use of bidirectional_dynamic_rnn in conjunction with a VariableScope in which initializer=orthogonal_initializer(). See, for example, the test program at
https://gist.github.com/nryant/57f7810e333fa94379cad201eeff24c8

Running this will result in a segfault with 1.4.0-rc1, but not with earlier versions. The problem is specific to the combination of orthogonal_initializer and bidirectional_dynamic_rnn and does not replicate with other initializers (e.g., uniform_unit_scaling_initializer) or dynamic_rnn. Nor does the choice of RNN cell appear to matter.
