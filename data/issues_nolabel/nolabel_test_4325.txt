Remove autoencoder estimator

Reasons for removal:

I created this one long time ago but it's not working anymore since the API has been evolved quite a bit. It causes confusion for users.
Better and more flexible API needed to be figured out in order to support different types of autoencoders, e.g. RNN/LSTM, etc. Or perhaps users can just create their own custom models.
