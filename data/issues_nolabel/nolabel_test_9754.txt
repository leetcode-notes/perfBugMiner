TensorFlow weight initialization taking 99% of total run time

System information

Have I written custom code: No (but custom data)
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow-gpu (1.0.0 and 1.1) (Python 3.5)

CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
I noticed that one of my networks was running slow and nvidia-smi was reporting only around ~10% GPU usage. After running the profiler, I saw that TruncatedNormal process was taking the vast majority of running time (see photo).
Profiler report
Source code / logs
Weight declaration function (from MNIST tutorial):

def weight_variable(shape):
    initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1)
    return tf.Variable(initial)

Code in action:
 # First Layer
    with tf.name_scope('input'):
        x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, Nvars])
    w1 = weight_variable([Nvars, 8])
    b1 = bias_variable([8])
    y1 = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(x, w1) + b1)
