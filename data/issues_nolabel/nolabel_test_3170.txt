Gradients are always zero during training

I have implemented YOLO algorithm in tensorflow and face with an issue during training: all my gradients are equal to zero from the very beginning of training. I also noticed that with some weights initialization gradients become non-zero at first several iterations and then stick to zero. Thanks in advance for any help!
