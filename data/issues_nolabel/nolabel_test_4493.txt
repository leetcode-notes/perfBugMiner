Tensorflow Bazel build error

Hello,
I was pointed here from StackOverflow, hopefully I am in the right place.
I have been trying to setup tensorflow on my Raspberry Pi 3B using the guide here. However I run into an error when executing the command:
bazel build -c opt --copt="-mfpu=neon" --local_resources 1024,1.0,1.0 --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Below is the error:
WARNING: Sandboxed execution is not supported on your system and thus hermeticity of actions cannot be guaranteed. See http://bazel.io/docs/bazel-user-manual.html#sandboxing for more information. You can turn off this warning via --ignore_unsupported_sandboxing.

expected ConfigurationTransition or NoneType for 'cfg' while calling label_list but got string instead: data.
ERROR: com.google.devtools.build.lib.packages.BuildFileContainsErrorsException: error loading package '': Extension file 'tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl' has errors.

I was told that this is possibly due to a bug.
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Error report #4319 however the thread seemed to stray from the original topic and I wasn't able to pick out if a fix had been found for the initial issue.
