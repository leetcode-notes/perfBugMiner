Fix unpickling/copying tf.app.flags.FLAGS

pickle.load() and copy.copy() check for the presence of  setstate().
The problem is that this check is made in the freshly allocated instance which
has not been init()-ed. Thus it's dict is completely empty and
getattr() fail with KeyError.
The fix is to check if __parsed is in the dict and raise
AttributeError if it isn't.
