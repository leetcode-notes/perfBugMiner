Introduce MPI allreduce and allgather in a new contrib project

This commit adds the tensorflow.contrib.mpi_collectives namespace and
contrib project, which has a variety of ops that work with MPI.
The MPI system works by starting a background thread which communicates
between the different processes at a regular interval and schedules
asynchronous reductions. At every tick, every rank will notify rank zero
of the tensors it is ready to reduce, signifying completion with an
empty DONE message. Rank zero will count how many ranks are ready to
reduce every tensor, and, whenever a tensor is ready to reduce (that is,
every rank is ready to reduce it), rank zero will issue a message to all
other ranks directing them to reduce that tensor.  This repeats for all
the tensors that are ready to reduce, after which rank zero sends all
other ranks a DONE message indicating that the tick is complete.
