N/A, we're using only CPUs for the moment. The tensor flow documentation suggests this is only an optional requirement?
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:

export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()

I get:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'
what():  Resource temporarily unavailable
Aborted

I've looked around for the common troubleshooting with no success. Any ideas where to start?
