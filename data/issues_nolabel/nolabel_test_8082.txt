Slicing a tensor by an index tensor in Tensorflow

Hi the tensorflow team in Github,
I am not sure if it is appropriate to ask questions in Issue. If questions should not be here, please let me know so that I can close it (I already asked this question on Stackoverflow but I think It would be better to ask this right here in Tensorflow?)
I have two following tensors (note that they are both Tensorflow tensors which means they are still virtually symbolic at the time I construct the following slicing op before I launch a tf.Session()):
params: has shape (64,784, 256)
indices: has shape (64, 784)
and I want to construct an op that returns the following tensor:
output: has shape (64,784) where
output[i,j] = params_tensor[i,j, indices[i,j] ]
What is the most efficient way in Tensorflow to do so?
Many thanks.
