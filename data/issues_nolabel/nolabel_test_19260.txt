[Lite] TOCO tool fails at StridedSlice op with negative output size

System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version: v1.8.0-1520-g1f03f82 1.8.0

Problem
I tried using the TOCO tool on a graph that contains a strided_slice op.
The code determining the fixed size of this op, fails at an assertion and throws an error (see below).
