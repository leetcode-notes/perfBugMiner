PollZmqOp for network communication

This PR adds PollZmqOp for retrieving data over the network (fixes #4836, ref #7951) . A few points for discussion:

ZeroMQ is LGPL but has some exceptions which seem to allow static linking. Is that a problem?
The Compute method of the Op is ensured to be thread safe by blocking. This could be improved by having a dictionary of sockets keyed by thread id or a connection pool. However, I have never needed concurrent calls to Compute in my work.
I'm not very familiar with bazel so there may be some problems in the dependencies.

This op allows for distributed training data generation to minimize the CPU workload on the training machine. For example, one or more machines can generate training data which can be retrieved by a training machine using the op. An example can be found in the test.
