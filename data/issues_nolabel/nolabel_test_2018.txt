fix index.md & add png files at "tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/images"

When I review TF tutorial using Github website at index.md on "tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.md"
There are no image on index.md and others
I think there are no png files. If I possible to upload png files on
for example "tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.md"
