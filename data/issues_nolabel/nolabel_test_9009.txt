Wrap python code into a tf operation

I have described my issue in the keras group issue 6163 but was re-directed here. I am trying to wrap a non-tf function (actually a class) into a tf operation to use in a custom keras layer. When using py_func it always returns  "ValueError: None values not supported." Is it generally possible to wrap an arbitrary piece of python code, which takes a list of numpy arrays as input and delivers a list of numpy arrays , into a tf op?

I have written custom code.
