wide_n_deep_tutorial.py

hello！I am woking on wide_n_deep_tutorial.py， and I change the download part like this:
def maybe_download():
  """May be downloads training data and returns train and test file names."""
  train_file_name = "./adult.data"
  print("Training data is %s" % train_file_name)

  test_file_name = "./adult.test"
  print("Test data is %s" % test_file_name)

  return train_file_name, test_file_name

and I got this error! :TypeError: argument of type 'float' is not iterable!
at this line:df_train[LABEL_COLUMN] = (df_train["income_bracket"].apply(lambda x: ">50K" in x)).astype(int)
I don't known how to make it right! please help!
