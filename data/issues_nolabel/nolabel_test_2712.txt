Tensorflow with Pyinstaller

It seems that Tensorflow does not work with Pyinstaller. I was trying to build a Tensorflow script into a executable file using Pyinstaller on Ubuntu. However the following error is reported:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/ops/_bucketization_op.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:  None
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
Steps to reproduce

Pyinstaller tensorflow_script.py
./tensorflow_script
