My problem---tensor-flow connect with Windows IIS?Hello,i just ask a question three days ago, but no response,can you spend some time to reply me?

I set up a tensorflow system, use flask grammar to set up . And in local computer, all run ok, no error.
But when I mount it in IIS, as Web API to use, It always show FASTCGI error. Does tensorflow incompatiable with IIS?
