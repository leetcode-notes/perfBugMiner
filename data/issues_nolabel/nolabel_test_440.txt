Will TensorFlow run on an AMD FX processor?

I'm looking at buying a new PC to run TensorFlow on.  The system I'm looking at has an AMD FX processor and a GTX 960 with 2GB of memory.  Will TensorFlow run fine on that processor and be able to take advantage of the GTX 960 for CUDA processing?  The O/S I'm planning on is Ubuntu Linux.
