More simpler examples of using dataflow_ops.StagingArea

Describe the problem
Getting the below error when using StagingArea.
ValueError: Fetch argument <tf.Operation 'group_deps' type=NoOp> cannot be interpreted as a Tensor. (Operation name: "group_deps" op: "NoOp"
The error happens only after completing a few 100 steps. It would be a great help if someone can place simpler examples of proper usage of StagingArea
Source code / logs
compute_stage_put_op = compute_stage.put(iterator.get_next()) if compute_stage_put_op.type == 'Stage': compute_stage_ops.append(compute_stage_put_op)
