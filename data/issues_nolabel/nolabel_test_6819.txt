add virtual START&END symbol to CRF and implement viterbi decoding

Two major changes.
1. add virtual START and END symbol to CRF implementation
2. reimplement viterbi decoding using tensorflow

The reason of the above modifications:
1. The original implementation of CRF use no virtual START and END symbol. 
    However crf can use the transition weights that starting from the virtual START 
    symbol to labels of the first step.
2. The original implementation of viterbi decoding uses numpy, which makes it 
    difficult to infer sequence labels in tensorflow computation graphs.
