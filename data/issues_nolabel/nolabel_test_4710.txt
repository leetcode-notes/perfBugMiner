download_dependencies.sh throws error on osx 10.10 - syntax issue

I receive this error on osx 10.10
$ sh tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh: line 51: syntax error near unexpected token `<'

It was fixed by changing line 51 to:
curl -Ls "${url}" | tar -C "${dir}" --strip-components=1 -xz
