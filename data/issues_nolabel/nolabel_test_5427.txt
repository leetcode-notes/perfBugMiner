tensorflow.contrib.layers.feature_column_ops with tf.placeholder tensors

Following up on the TF.Learn tutorials demonstrating linear models with categorical variables (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/linear/overview.html), I have tried to re-use the functions & abstractions from tensorflow.contrib.layers.feature_column_ops to hash, encode & cross my input categorical columns while still handling the rest of the computing in low-level TensorFlow.
However, when I pass a normal Tensor (or placeholder) as values of the columns_to_tensors parameters of weighted_sum_from_feature_columns (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/feature_column_ops.py#L460), it fails because of the shape parameter being not available.
Is there any way or plan to enable passing any Tensors other than SparseTensors to this function?
