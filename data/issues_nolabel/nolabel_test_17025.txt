Adds a check for shuffle=None in numpy_input_fn

numpy_input_fn's shuffle argument is set to None by default. If the argument is not provided, the function raises a TypeError since shuffle is of type NoneType and not bool.
This is fixed by adding a simple check to see if shuffle is None, and setting it to False if so.
From my understanding, this should be the desired behavior. Do let me know if this is not the case! It doesn't seem like additional test code is needed, or any existing test code needs to be changed.
Thanks!
