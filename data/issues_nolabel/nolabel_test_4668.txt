Implement tf.nn.atrous_conv2d_transpose()

Can we have a atrous_conv2d_transpose() function, just like the existing conv2d_transpose() function? Or is there some simple way to get what I am looking for using other existing functions?
I had a look at the conv2d_transpose() code, and it seems shouldn't be too difficult to adapt it to get a atrous_conv2d_transpose().
Thanks.
