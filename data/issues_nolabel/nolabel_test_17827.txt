TensorFlowLite pod, iOS, linker doesn't find GetSegmentPredictions function

Hi,
I added the 0.0.2 version of TensorFlowLite pod to my project. I try to experiment with the Smart Reply demo. I used the Android demo code to start from. I can find the related function (GetSegmentPredictions) in one of the pod headers. but the linker doesn't find the appropriate code segment at build time.
Is there any body who could try out the Smart Reply on iOS?
When will this be added to the TensorFlowLite pod?
thanks!
