Feature Request: Getting a collection of variable from specific Graph

Hi,
For debug purposes, I need to create a collection variables from a specific graph.
I have defined my model in a predefined graph using something like:
pg=tf.Graph()
with pg.as_default():
...
I define my session as:
sess = tf.Session(config=config, graph=pg)
If I need to create a collection of trainable variable in graph pg, I try to use:
tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES) or simply tf.trainable_variables(), It doesn't return anything .
If I do the same experiment, using the default 'default graph', and without using 'with', constructs, I am able to get the collection of variables.
I suspect, tf.get_variables is not looking in pg, I believe a method for extracting collection of variables from a given graph, or device would be useful for everybody.
If the feature already exist, please accept my apology for wasting your precious time.
I did check on stack overflow and other avenues suggested by Google.
-Regards
