Different scatter_nd behaviours with int and float

I am using tensorflow 1.4.1.
scatter_nd seems not check the index validation with float, because following codes generate no error.
a = tf.scatter_nd( [[0,99,0,0]], [[1.0 for i in range(16)]], [100, 8, 100, 100, 16])
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(a))

If the 1.0 is changed to 1, the codes generate errors:
a = tf.scatter_nd( [[0,99,0,0]], [[1 for i in range(16)]], [100, 8, 100, 100, 16])
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(a))

Is this designed for some purpose or a bug?
