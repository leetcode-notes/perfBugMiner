Environment info

pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL

ImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


I see from #5343, it says:
"Correct, starting 0.11.0rc1, all our prebuilt packages are now built for cuda8.
With cuda7.5, you either need to install the 0.11.0rc0 wheel file, or build from sources.
"
so, may I know where I can find 0.11.0rc1 url for pip installation? like:
pip install [0.11.0rc1 url]
no resource from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow/0.11.0rc0
I cannot build tensorflow from source code because I work in permission limited environment  and I cannot get the info where cuda is installed but only can use nvcc --version to get cuda related info.

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
