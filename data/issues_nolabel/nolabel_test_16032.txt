When will those operations such as "BuiltinOperator_L2_NORMALIZATION" be delegated to NNAPI?

System information
Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from: pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1
Python version: 2.7.5
My problem:
My android application wants to load the "facenet" model through TF lite with NNAPI enabled to do face recognition. But it always crashed. After I debugged,  I found it was caused by that the "L2_NORMALIZATION"  was not delegated to NNAPI. I wonder when will those operations be supported by nnapi_delegate, as my application has to use the hardware acceleration. Or is there any workaround to make the application complete normally with "Use_NNAPI" enabled ?
