libtensorflow.so: undefined reference to `__cpu_model'

When linking with the tensorflow C++ library, the following error occurs: libtensorflow.so: undefined reference to `__cpu_model'
Seems to be related to issue #7223
I manage to work around this error with: ( as done by d7955a6)
#ifndef USE_SSE_CRC32C
in the file tensorflow/core/lib/hash/crc32c_accelerate.cc
Doing this removed the error.
System information:
Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit
Intel i5 CPU
NVIDIA GTX 980 GPU
Built using CMake with BUILD_SHARED_LIB enabled which creates the libtensorflow.so file
