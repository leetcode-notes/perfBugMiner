TensorFlow Tutorials should have a Jupyter notebook friendly option

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Nope
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10 (latest 04/27/2018)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
python -m pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.7.0
Python version:
3.6.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/1.7
GPU model and memory: GeoForce GTX 1050Ti (4GB)
Exact command to reproduce:
I opened jupyter notebook in my main python installation:
C:\Users\ (me) \AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Scripts\jupyter-notebook.exe
I downloaded the master models folder, put it in my jupyter directory and went to
http://localhost:8888/tree/models-master/official/wide_deep
Then I created a new notebook (in the wide_deep directory) and tried to do the very first shell command

! data_download.py
Describe the problem
The TensorFlow tutorial code (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide) can't be run from Jupyter notebook. TensorFlow is a tool mainly for data scientists and we use Jupyter notebook a lot! The official tutorial/sample code should have a Jupyter friendly option.
