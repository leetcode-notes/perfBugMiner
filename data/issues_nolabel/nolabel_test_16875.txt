Update Dockerfile to install Python 3.6

The Python 3 containers at gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow generated by tensorflow/tools/docker are currently built using Python 3.5.
It would be nice to update them to Python 3.6 instead, which I think would be as simple as adding sudo apt-get install python3.6.
