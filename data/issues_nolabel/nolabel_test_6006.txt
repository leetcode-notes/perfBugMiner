split will move leading or trailing whitespace when sep is whitespace

split will move leading or trailing whitespace when sep is whitespace, so strip() is useless
If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [].
