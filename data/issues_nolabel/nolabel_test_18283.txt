Document for `tf.TextLine.Dataset.shuffle` is confusing.

In the doc for V1.7.
The signature is:
shuffle(
    buffer_size,
    seed=None,
    reshuffle_each_iteration=None
)

and in below description:
reshuffle_each_iteration: (Optional.) A boolean, which if true indicates that the dataset should be pseudorandomly reshuffled each time it is iterated over. (Defaults to True.)
I can't tell what is default value for reshuffle_each_iteration and so I can't tell the default behaviour.
