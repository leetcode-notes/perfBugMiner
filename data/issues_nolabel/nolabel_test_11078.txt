error running object_detection samples TypeError: unorderable types: tuple() < str()

I cannot run any of the examples from the new object detection api. I followed the documented "prepare inputs" and "run locally", but when I run the below command I get the following error.
python3 train.py --pipeline_config_path=/home/chris/tensorflow/models/object_detection/samples/configs/ssd_inception_v2_pets.config --train_dir=.

I get the feeling this error is because it isn't processing the record file correctly, or something along those lines is wrong. However, as far as I can tell, I followed everything correctly. I edited the paths in the config file and triple checked that they point to real files.
