Eye Iris Identification using Tensorflow

Hello,
In my android app, I'm looking to build eye iris identification for each user. Can I do this with Tensorflow lite? The user would use their native camera to put infront of their eyes, Tensorflow will detect if this is identified or not from our database.
Thank you,
Kind Regards,
