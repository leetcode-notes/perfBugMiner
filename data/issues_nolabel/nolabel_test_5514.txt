AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'global_variables_initializer'

when I was trying a multi gpu training using python cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py --num_gpus=2, I got an error:
usr@linux:~/tensorflow_source/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10$ python cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py --num_gpus=2

Seemingly there's no global_variables_initializer of tf or in other module?
