[Feature request] dynamically catch exceptions in TensorFlow as part of the graph execution

Via this StackOverflow question:
E.g. the QueueBase.dequeue function can raise an OutOfRangeError exception which I will receive in Python from the Session.run call. It would be nice to catch the exception inside the graph, similar as tf.cond. E.g. something like:
result = tf.on_exception(queue.dequeue(), lambda: 42)

Maybe also the first argument would need to be a lambda such that it can properly set the context.
To make this work, like in tf.cond, the result from both arguments would need to be of the same type.
