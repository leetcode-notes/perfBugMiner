Tensorflow restore doesn't work on AWS

I am running a script that perfectly works on ubuntu 14.04, docker over ubuntu 14.04, docker over MAC OS - but doesn't work on ubuntu 16 on AWS.
the script is:
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def load_model_to_session(session, model_dir, meta_file, ckpt_file):
    model_dir_exp = os.path.expanduser(model_dir)
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(os.path.join(model_dir_exp, meta_file))
    saver.restore(session, os.path.join(model_dir_exp, ckpt_file))

session = tf.Session()
print ('loading models')
model_dir = '/data/model'
meta_file, ckpt_file = 'a.meta', 'a.ckpt'
print ('ckpt file ' + ckpt_file)
load_model_to_session(session, model_dir, meta_file, ckpt_file)
print ('finish loading the model')
session.close()


the errors i get:

in order to reproduce this, you can use the pre-trained open source model here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVSTgxX25ZQzNTMGc/view
I'm using tensorflow (python) 0.12.1 .
I suspect that it has something to do with the virtualization (AWS).
BTW, the code works on the pretrained model http://download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_v1_2016_08_28.tar.gz
