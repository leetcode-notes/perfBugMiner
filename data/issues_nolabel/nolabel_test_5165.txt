Remove conflict include statments in port.cc

I was getting errors like following when building PIP package with Bazel:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\include\\um\WinSock2.h(2699): error C2375: 'WSAAsyncSelect': redefinition; different linkage
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\include\\um\winsock.h(933): note: see declaration of 'WSAAsyncSelect'

Turned out these two line was removed at 46110c5,
-#include <WinSock2.h>      
-#pragma comment(lib, "Ws2_32.lib")

But brought back at c5ab3dd
Seems like a merge error to me.
