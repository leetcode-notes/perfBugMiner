Android TF Classify: Reduce input size

I'm trying to reduce input size in ClassifierActivity, but I get java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Input to reshape is a tensor with 128 values, but the requested shape requires a multiple of 2048
  private static final int INPUT_SIZE = 96; // original 224
  private static final int IMAGE_MEAN = 117;
  private static final float IMAGE_STD = 1;
  private static final String INPUT_NAME = "input";
  private static final String OUTPUT_NAME = "output";

What should I do to reduce it? (my cropped image is also 96x96)
Also do I have to change IMAGE_MEAN ? Not sure what it means
