[Discussion] Limit the exported symbols from _pywrap_tensorflow.so

TensorFlow statically links many fundamental libraries and exported all their symbols, this can cause version conflict for other modules outside of TensorFlow which links against a different version library, see the symbol lookup rules.
For example, I have a script which involves TensorFlow and matplotlib. Just start a Python CLI and execute:
import tensorflow af tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# ...
plt.show()

The matplotlib may links to libpng symbols from _pywrap_tensorflow.so instead of libpng even though the only installed libpng is the correct one. And it will complains and fails:
libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.21
libpng warning: Application  is  running with png.c from libpng-1.2.53
libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library

Similar to #1927 and #1924
Fortunately, we have a clear interface, the SWIG APIs. So we may consider only exporting these symbols, here is the guide.
This also applies to other shared libraries like libtensorflow.so which export C/C++ interfaces.
