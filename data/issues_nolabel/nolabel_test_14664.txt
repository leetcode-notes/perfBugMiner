Describe the problem
When trying to compile the TF Lite Android demo with Bazel, it doesn't work, yielding:
WARNING: The major revision of the Android NDK referenced by android_ndk_repository rule 'androidndk' is 16. The major revisions supported by Bazel are [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Defaulting to revision 14.
