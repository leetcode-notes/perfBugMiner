DLL load failed on Windows 10 with tensorflow 1.7

Hello to all,
on my Windows 10, I installed tensorflow 1.5 and it works, but if I try to upgrade to tensorflow 1.7 it don't works, appeare the error:
ImportError: DLL load failed
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pywrap_tensorflow_internal'
Microsoft C++ Runtime is updated
If I downgrade to the version 1.5 it works again
How can I solve it ?
Thanks
Sergio
