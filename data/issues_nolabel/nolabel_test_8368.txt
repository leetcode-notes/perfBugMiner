Reuse some parameters of a Variable

I know how to reuse complete variables Tensorflow in two different operations as explained in the documentation: [https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variable_scope]
But, is it possible to reuse parameters in more complex ways? In particular, is it possible to specify that two variables of different shapes share some parameters in common?
A small example of what I am trying to do: I would like to have a model with 25 parameters. I would like to use these parameters in three variables X, Y, and Z so that X uses all parameters in a 5x5 tensor:
X =
w11, w12, ... , w15
w21, w22, ... , w25
...
w51, w52, ... , w55
while Y uses 9 of the parameters in a 3x3 tensor, for example the middle 3x3 block of X. That is:
Y =
w22, w23, w24
w32, w33, w34
w42, w43, w44
while Z uses the same nine weights as Y and also in a 3x3 tensor, but transposed with respect to Y, that is:
Z =
w22, w32, w42
w23, w33, w43
w24, w34, w44
If this is not possible, are there plans in the Tensorflow development community to support this capability?
