Tensorflow 1.3 with Python 3.6.2 under Windows 10 64 Bit OS has issue when run tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/label_image.py

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 X64 Enterprise Edition
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: Anaconda 4.4.0 Python 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): no
CUDA/cuDNN version: No
GPU model and memory: No
Exact command to reproduce:
(tensorflow13) C:\Users\James\Tensorflow\model-retrain\tensorflow-for-poets-2\scripts>python .\label_image.py --image c:\Users\James\Tensorflow\sample_img\Panda001.jpg --graph c:\Users\James\Tensorflow\model-retrain\tensorflow-for-poets-2\scripts\retrained_graph.pb --labels C:\Users\James\Tensorflow\model-retrain\tensorflow-for-poets-2\scripts\retrained_labels.txt

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
