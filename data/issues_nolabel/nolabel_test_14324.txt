input_dims not a constant expression in slice_op.cc

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian 9.0 (with a Gentoo Prefix)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): c81acfb (15 hours old)
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 6.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: no CUDA
GPU model and memory: no GPU
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=mkl --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
It seems that 8011eda merged a C++ error in file tensorflow/core/kernels/slice_op.cc line 255.
As seen line 232, input_dims is a constant (const), but is not a constant expression (constexpr), thus it should not be used as a template parameter.
