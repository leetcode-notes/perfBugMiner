Fixed Minor Bug in tensorflow/python/platform/googletest.py

There was a bug in the function GetTempDir of the module, in line 118.
I found this bug when I built tensorflow from source on my system and tried to test the install and it gave the following error while simply importing tensorflow in python shell.
SyntaxError: name '_googletest_temp_dir' is used prior to global declaration

The variable was already reference at line number : 103 so thats why the error was showing up.
The global declaration was moved to staring of the function to solve the issue.
