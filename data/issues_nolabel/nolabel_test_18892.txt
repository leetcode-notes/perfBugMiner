Build libtensorflow.so and libtensorflow_framework.so for Raspberry Pi.

Build libtensorflow.so and libtensorflow_framework.so binaries for Raspberry Pi during CI builds.
I'm looking to add C# support for Tensorflow on ARM (Raspberry Pi, etc.) to TensorFlowSharp (https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp), and this would allow me to move forward more easily.
Fixes #17850
