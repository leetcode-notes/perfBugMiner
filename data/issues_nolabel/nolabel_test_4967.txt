Update protobuf to get a fix from upstream

We already have a fix in protbuf google/protobuf#2246
This makes TF build with Bazel at HEAD again.
Fix bazelbuild/bazel#1929
I understand TF is currently using a release version of protobuf, is this change acceptable?
BTW @mrry 's fix will also get fetched by this change
google/protobuf#2203
