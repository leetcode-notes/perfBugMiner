solve the bug which the python include config gives out repeat results

./configure

Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/home/wenjian/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages]

it shows repeat result in config on python includes, it is because the old code show paths[0] and ret_paths at the same time,
so I add a else condition and do some simple optimization by using join
