Feature Request: Make lstm2d.separable_lstm accept Dynamic Batch Sizes

Apparently, lstm2d.separable_lstm doesn't accept dynamic batch sizes (number of images). Whenever I set the shape of a placeholder to (None, height, width, depth) to be fed into the network , I get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\tensorflow\contrib\ndlstm\python\lstm2d.py", line 159, in separable_lstm
    hidden = horizontal_lstm(images, nhidden)
  File "...\tensorflow\contrib\ndlstm\python\lstm2d.py", line 82, in horizontal_lstm
    sequence = images_to_sequence(images)
  File "...\tensorflow\contrib\ndlstm\python\lstm2d.py", line 47, in images_to_sequence
    [width, num_image_batches * height, depth])
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'

I guess it would be nice to have separable_lstm accept dynamic batch sizes so it can be used effectively.
