how to disable do_constant_folding  of OptimizerOptions for my custom ops

I write two ops named own_send and own_recv in c++
own_send write data to an buffer while wait the buffer flag is 0 ,then set the buffer flag to 1
own_recv read the buffer while wait the buffer flag is 1 and set the flag to 0
but when I run my model I got the error own_recv is waiting the buffer flag is 1 but the flag is 0 when own_send is done rightly.
I finally found the GraphOptimizer class would run own_recv  previously ends with my flag is changed before my model really process.
I run the code following get the error own_recv is always  waiting the flag is 1 thile the flag is 0.
input = [tf.ones([3136,1024])]
send = own_send(input)
recv = own_recv([tf.ones([1])])
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(recv)
then I try to run with opt_level is L0, it works:
input = [tf.ones([3136,1024])]
send = own_send(input)
recv = own_recv([tf.ones([1])])
config = tf.ConfigProto(graph_options=tf.GraphOptions(optimizer_options=tf.OptimizerOptions(opt_level=tf.OptimizerOptions.L0)))
sess = tf.Session(config = config)
sess.run(recv)
I want to know how to disable the optimizer options just for my own custiom ops leaving the other ops optimied
Is there some path to disable option for specified ops ï¼Ÿ
something like  add some opt in my BUILD ?
