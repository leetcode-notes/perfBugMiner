the determinant is not finite

Describe the problem
The items ‘tf.matrix_determinant(sig))‘ and 'tf.matrix_inverse(sig) 'induce error when i try to transform my code from CPU version with r1.2 Tensorflow on windows to GPU r1.4 tensorflow on Ubuntu 16.04. It works fine on windows,while something's wrong on Linux.
I'm not sure whether this problem is triggered by changed version of Tensorflow or the changed platform from CPU to GPU
It seems to me that the data precision has something to do with this, but have little knowlege on this region. Any idea what causes this phenomenon and how to solve this? Thx!
Here are the errors.
