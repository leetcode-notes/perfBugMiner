Fix floating point exception when loading from a small events log file using the loader

Issue:  Floating point exception when using the loader to load some data from a small events log file

Fixed the bps calculation to guard against div by 0
Tested this manually with the different size logs we have from our experiment.

If you have suggestions or a recommended way to add a unit test for the loader, I'd be glad to look into it.  Please let me know. Thanks.
TESTING:
For now, I have tested this manually with the logs we have from our experiment.
