Fix the download of the notMNIST dataset.

It seems the Apache server at http://yaroslavvb.com is configured to
allow access to only specific user agents. By passing a user agent
string like wget or Mozilla, it could be tricked into allowing the
notebook to download the dataset. It is an ugly hack for urllib, would
have been simpler if the notebook used the requests module :-)
