Library not loaded: @rpath/libcudart.8.0.dylib but I have libcudart.7.5.dylib

I have the following error when importing tensor flow (GPU OSX version);
ImportError: dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so, 10): Library not loaded: @rpath/libcudart.8.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so
  Reason: image not found

It looks to me like it is looking for @rpath/libcudart.8.0.dylib but in my /usr/local/cuda/lib I have libcudart.7.5.dylib and no 8.0. How do I redirect it?
