Change the swap threshold by adding an elastic percentage

Originally, heuristic memory swapping feature won't improve much on the batch size, that's because IdentifySwappingCandidates are fully trusting the statically analysis.
Per my experiment, this did not improve the batch size at all.
While If we make the swapping threshold to be lower,for example, when analyzed memory usage is 0.8 * GPU mem size, then swapping feature is triggered.
According to my experiments, for my K80 (12G), ResNet50, batch size can be improved from 128 to 150.
