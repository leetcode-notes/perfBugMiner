error in computing fft of a float variable

Python 3.5
tensorflow GPU
I am unable to compute the 1 D fft. My input values will be positive and negative float values not complex numbers.
x = tf.Variable([1.2,2,3,4.1,5.9],dtype=tf.float32) sess.run(tf.fft(x))
the error that i get
TypeError:Input 'input' of 'FFT' Op has type int32 that does not match expected type of complex64
I have tried
sess.run(tf.batch_fft(x))
but it gives an error as tensorflow has no module batch_fft.
did I miss any thing in the installation of tensorflow ??
I tried declaring these variables dtype=tf.complex64
it gave another error
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'FFT' with these attrs. Registered kernels: <no registered kernels> [[Node: FFT = FFT[](Variable/read)]]
