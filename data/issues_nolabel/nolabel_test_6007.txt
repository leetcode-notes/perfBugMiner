tf.name_scope with reuse

I want to reuse a name scope which was created earlier with tf.name_scope. Normally, name_scope will create a new unique name in the current namespace. If it ends with "/", it will ignore the current namespace and use it as an absolute name scope but then it doesn't make it unique. I want a way that it just uses the name as I provide it in the current namespace.
Current code:
  @contextlib.contextmanager
  def name_scope(self, name):
      ...
      old_stack = self._name_stack
      if not name:  # Both for name=None and name="" we re-set to empty scope.
        new_stack = None
      elif name and name[-1] == "/":
        new_stack = name[:-1]
      else:
        new_stack = self.unique_name(name)
      self._name_stack = new_stack
      yield "" if new_stack is None else new_stack + "/"

I suggest something like:
  @contextlib.contextmanager
  def name_scope(self, name, reuse=False):
    if reuse:
      new_stack = self._name_stack + "/" + name
    else:
      ...
