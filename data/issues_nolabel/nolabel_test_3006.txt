TensorBoard doesn't display Events under Safari

I've been attempting to view events in TensorBoard, using both the mnist_with_summaries.py tutorial, and a much simpler example from the "Hello, TensorFlow!" article (example code at the bottom of this page: https://www.oreilly.com/learning/hello-tensorflow). In both cases, I can see the Graph, but nothing under Events.
Environment info
Operating System: OSX 10.11.5
Running Python 3.5.1 (installed from the DMG installer on python.org)
Installed tensorflow 0.9.0rc0 via pip3
Steps to reproduce

Paste the following code into a file:

import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(1.0, name='input')
w = tf.Variable(0.8, name='weight')
y = tf.mul(w, x, name='output')
y_ = tf.constant(0.0, name='correct_value')
loss = tf.pow(y - y_, 2, name='loss')
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.025).minimize(loss)

for value in [x, w, y, y_, loss]:
    tf.scalar_summary(value.op.name, value)

summaries = tf.merge_all_summaries()

sess = tf.Session()
summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('log_simple_stats', sess.graph)

sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
for i in range(100):
    summary_writer.add_summary(sess.run(summaries), i)
    sess.run(train_step)

Run the code, then after it is complete, run "tensorboard --logdir=log_simple_stats/"
Go to localhost:6006, under Events, there are no Runs listed.
What have you tried?

Adding a flush() call to the summary writer
Copying the css and js directories under tensorboard/lib, from source (this had no effect, so I reverted the change)

Logs or other output that would be helpful
The log output looks like:
Looking in log_simple_stats reveals:
-rw-r--r--  1 jason  staff  19030 Jun 23 01:11 events.out.tfevents.1466669497.hostname.local
MD5 (events.out.tfevents.1466669497.hostname.local) = f7032e6e643bbac6b0009411a02cb8db
And the logs from tensorboard:
