shapes incompatible after upgrade

After upgrade from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0rc0 my code no longer runs:
(802, 277)
(802, 1)

ValueError: Shapes (?, 1) and (?,) are incompatible

My code:
...
print shape(trainX) # (802, 277)
print shape(trainY) # (802, 1)
classifier.fit(x=trainX, y=trainY, steps=2000)
...

This worked fine on 0.10.0. Notice the shapes in the beginning of output (looks like a valid combination to me).
