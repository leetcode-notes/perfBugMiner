NameError: global name 'xrange' is not defined in Python 3 - and solution proposal

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04 Docker image
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/boosted_trees/examples/boston.py

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Running the example code under python 3.6 in Docker environment I got xrange error: NameError: global name 'xrange' is not defined in Python 3
I propose to change every xrange to range under the 3.x versions:
patch for xrange
find /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/boosted_trees -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/ xrange(/ range(/g'
