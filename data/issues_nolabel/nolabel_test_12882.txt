[OpenCL SYCL] Add support for triSYCL in TensorFlow

Add the ability to use triSYCL as the SYCL implementation in TensorFlow when OpenCL SYCL support is enabled, relates to #22
Note that triSYCL is still work in progress and many features are missing, currently only the host device can be used (triSYCL/triSYCL#51).
ComputeCPP is a much more reliable way of using SYCL with TensorFlow.
