Windows 7 Enterprise
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example


I have download and installed the windows docker with:
docker run -p 8888:8888 -e "PASSWORD=****" -d --name tensorflow b.gcr.io/tensorflow-udacity/assignments


I run the docker with a jupyter notebook:
docker start tensorflow (and then navigate: 192.168.99.100:8888)


The code fails at the beggining:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
import time
import datetime
from tensorflow.contrib import learn



ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
8 import datetime
9 # import tensorflow.contrib as tfc
---> 10 from tensorflow.contrib import learn
11
12 # Parameters
ImportError: cannot import name learn
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Reinstalling everything and changing tensorflow.contrib by tf.contrib.
What can I do?
Help is appreciated.
