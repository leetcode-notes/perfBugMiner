Keras backend functionality changed?

Hi,
I have been using keras from within tensorflow since it was included into the contrib package - but it seems that in the 1.4 release the keras backend is missing some functionality ...
For example:
>> from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K
>> K.tile
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.keras.backend' has no attribute 'tile'

Whereas in tensorflow 1.1:
>>> from tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras import backend as K
>>> K.tile
<function tile at 0x7fbd9024fb70>

And using pure keras:
>>> from keras import backend as K
Using TensorFlow backend.

>>> K.tile
<function tile at 0x7fe9743c5950>

Is this just an omission, or has the functionality been deliberately removed?  I know I can use the equivalent tensorflow operation - but it's nice to be able to use a reasonably portable api and if I wanted to switch backend I could just change the import path.  I also try not too mix keras and tensorflow too much as I think the code is more readable just using one!

Alex
