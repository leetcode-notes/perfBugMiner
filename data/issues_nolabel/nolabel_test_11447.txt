Feature Request: sparse matrix triangular solver

I have just written about this in stack overflow,
but I just realized it would be more relevant if be put here.
I think it would be very helpful if we could do solve linear equation Ax = b,
where A has a sparse matrix representation, for example,
containing lower triangular entries for a banded symmetric-matrix.
Because, AFAIK, in this case, we need to convert the sparse matrix A
with the tf.sparse_to_dense(), to run the tf.matrix_triangular_solve().
But, if the dimension of A is very large, e.g., about 16000x16000,
and with very sparse entries, e.g., about 46000 non-zeros (0.018%),
it would take a huge amount of memory.
Or maybe there is another way to do it in Tensorflow?
