Missing C++ headers for Session API in PIP packages.

C++ headers for the session APIs, such as tensorflow/core/public/<session.h session_options.h tensor_c_api.h> are not included in the official PIP packages. Could we have them included in the list of headers to export in the framework_headers target in tensorflow/core/BUILD or is there a reason to exclude them?
