How to install Tensorflow on Python3 (using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows)

Hi,
I have Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (on Windows 10) also I have python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 installed. When I follow below url to install tensor flow it installs in python 2.7 only.

I want to install tensorflow on Python 3.5. Please let me know how to install the same. To move to python 3.5, I use python3.5 on the Bash command prompt.
Many Thanks, Thirumalai M
