using finally in tf_record_iterator()

Hi, this is to handle the case when generator.throw() or generator.close() is called on a tfrecord iterator.
It will raise an exception like GeneratorExit in the generator's stack, and using finally: will promptly release the resources in such cases, without relying on garbage collection.
Please let me know if I'm missing something.
