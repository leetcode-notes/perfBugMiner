macbook pro GPU version, successfully opened CUDA library, but not found the GPU

Hi ALL:
I am a chinese student, so may be English is bas. Sorry.
now I use the tensorflow GPU version. I user the pip to down the python3 GPU version, and down the all about the GPU file.
But i can successfully opened CUDA library, but not found the GPU, like this:
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.dylib locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.dylib locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcufft.dylib locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcuda.1.dylib locally I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcurand.dylib locally

and I find the I can't deviceQuery the GPU:

now I use the mac os, and Xcode8, how to solve it ?
