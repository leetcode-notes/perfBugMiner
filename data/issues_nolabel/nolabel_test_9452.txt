add support for flat both inner and outer dims

Hi,
I'm trying to flat both the inner and outer dims and only keeps the middle ones but I didn't find any existing method in tensorflow that support this.  So I implement one. Hope this is helpful and can be merged into tensorflow.
A brief changelog:

add new method flat_inner_outer_dims
change private method ComputeFlatInnerDims and ComputeFlatOuterDims to static member
add tests for flat_inner_outer_dims
