VARIABLES Collection name is deprecated, please use GLOBAL_VARIABLES instead

I pulled the latest HEAD a few mins ago and ran my code.  I started to get the listed error:
WARNING:tensorflow:VARIABLES Collection name is deprecated, please use GLOBAL_VARIABLES instead.
VARIABLES will be removed after 2017-03-02
I didn't fully debug all the causes but seems like there is errors thrown when the following lines are hit:

from tensorflow.contrib.session_bundle import exporter

if I remove that line, it seems to move to another line building the graph, not sure if it is a "get_variables()" operation or something.  I don't use VARIABLES anywhere in  my code.  Given the "saver" below causing a similar issue, it is possible my "histogram_summary" or "scalar_summary" ops may have triggered this as well while building the graph.
The same error is printed on each iteration of "save()" with the saver, this really messes up my logging to the screen:

save_path = saverRun.save(session, saveto)

Seems like something within the Saver and possibly the "variables" might need updating.
