Can not load workspace.bzl

I have a project that I want to build with Bazel, which includes Python code and C++ files. I am trying to use the same approach as in Syntaxnet from the model zoo. I add tensorflow as a submodule to my repository and put the following snippet to my WORKSPACE file:
local_repository(
  name = "org_tensorflow",
  path = __workspace_dir__ + "/tensorflow",
)

load('//tensorflow/tensorflow:workspace.bzl', 'tf_workspace')
tf_workspace("tensorflow/", "@org_tensorflow")

which results in an error
ERROR: com.google.devtools.build.lib.packages.BuildFileContainsErrorsException: error loading package '': Extension file not found. Unable to load package for '//third_party/gpus:cuda_configure.bzl': BUILD file not found on package path.

The source of the error is clear to me: this line contains a load call with a hard-coded path. SyntaxNet uses an older version of Tensorflow that does not contain this line.
My question is if this is a bug or not. Is this a recommended way of organizing the project that should be compiled with Tensorflow, and if not, should it be used in Syntaxnet model? Or should I just copy the WORKSPACE from Tensorflow's root directory?
