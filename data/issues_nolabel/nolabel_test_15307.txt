Setting proper sonames on Linux

Setting proper soname prevents from linking with absolute path when using cmake.
The reference below contains long conversation about the issue with linking, but the general idea is when a library has no DT_SONAME field, executable is linked with absolute path and can't be used in a different environment, setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't help.
