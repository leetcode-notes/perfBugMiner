Can't visualize plots from multiple log directories in Tensorboard after refreshing browser. Must close reopen tab.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Run tensorboard for one log directory such as:
tensorboard --logdir=some/directory1
View it on a browser
Run tensorboard for two log directories such as:
tensorboard --logdir=somelabel1:some/directory1,somelabel2:some/directory2
Refresh the browser tab

Expected: two plots
Actual: only one plot

If you close the browser tab and then navigate to tensorboard again the two plots will be visible.

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Close reopen browser tab.
