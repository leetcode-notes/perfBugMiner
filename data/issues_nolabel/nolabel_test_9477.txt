Add 3D operations for layers: conv3d, avg_pool3d and max_pool3d

1.Fix a TODO(jbms):
change 'rate' parameter to 'dilation_rate' for consistency with underlying op.
2.Add 3D operations for layers:
conv3d
avg_pool3d
max_pool3d
3.Replace a deprecated function in layers_test.py.
4.Add unit test for avg_pool3d and max_pool3d.
