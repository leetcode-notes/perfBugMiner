W tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:2223]

The source code I try to compile has been changed, and now it requires tf-nightly build(1.4 version). For that reason, I created new conda environment which includes 1.4 version of tensorflow.
However, I still use the same set-up except the version of tensorflow. I've read they anticipate releasing 1.4 version of tensorflow wih cuDNN 7 instead of cuDNN 6. Is this the reason that I get these warnings? Should I upgrade the cuDNN version from 6 to 7.
I'm also getting "RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match runtime version 3.6" although I loaded the 3.6 version of tf-nightly build.
This is what I get:
