Build fail on OSX (@ 2cb25ab)

I recently refreshed my master and now build fails on my laptop. Also tried building from a fresh clone. That fails too.
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
.........
ERROR: /Users/delip/Softwares/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/embedding/BUILD:10:6: syntax error at '"//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl"': First argument of load() is a path, not a label. It should start with a single slash if it is an absolute path..

I just noticed now that Jenkins status is red for OSX too. Until this gets fixed, what is the latest commit for which OSX builds were working? Also, any tips on fixing this locally will help too. I'm not conversant with Bazel, unfortunately.
