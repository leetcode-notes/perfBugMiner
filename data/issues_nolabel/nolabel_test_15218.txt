stupid question but please help me to answer this

I have a problem with parallel computing. I know that CUDA or pyCUDA can do such thing like 3D convolution in parallel.
I think about using tensorflow GPU by calling tf.nn.conv3d(input, filter), does it uses build in functions in CUDA to operate 3D convolution with parallel computing or there are somethings else?
I am not familiar with C++ or even with pyCuda I am not sure how to implement 3D convolution with it.
Same question with all type of other implement with tensorflow GPU.
Bests,
