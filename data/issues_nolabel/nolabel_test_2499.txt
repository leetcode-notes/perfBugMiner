Fedora 23: build fails with missing libcudart.so.7.5 without `--genrule_strategy=standalone`

Hi, this is a continuation of Issue #2053, because that one was closed for no apparent reason.
Compiling the GPU version of the tutorials_example_trainer target fails on Fedora 23 with the message:
bazel-out/host/bin/tensorflow/cc/ops/random_ops_gen_cc: error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.7.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Target //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer failed to build

When using the command line
path/to/bazel/output/bazel build -c opt --config=cuda -j 4 //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

When adding --genrule_strategy=standalone, the compilation succeeds.
I believe that either the Documentation should be updated to include this flag, or that the build system is changed to pass it automatically.
