Error building from source

Hi all,
I'm trying to build TF from source so that I can run it in development mode and be able to expand the functionality of some of the modules, but am running into some snags with the bazel building.
Environment info
Operating System:
Mac OSX Yosemite
If installed from source, provide


The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)

The output of bazel version

Running: bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures
gives

I'm having a lot of difficulty interpreting these error messages  and am not finding too much on Stack Overflow or other TF git threads. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
