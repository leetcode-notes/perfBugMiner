Segmentation fault on tensorflow 0.9.0

Hello,
I installed tensorflow 0.9.0 from source in conda environment, It seems that the last comit didn't solve completely the problem, because I'm getting a segmentation fault while importing tensorflow (even if I import or not numpy and scipy before).
Note: this error occur only in tf 0.9, when trying tf 0.8, everything works well (but no GPU support for iOS in 0.8 version)

Steps to reproduce

Create a conda environment
Clone tensorflow 0.9.0 repository
Build it from souce using the instructions in Readme file
Launch python and import numpy and tensorflow (or import just tensorflow)

What have you tried?

import tensorflow

uninstall tensorflow 0.8 outside the conda evironment
