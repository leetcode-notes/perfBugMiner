OutOfRangeError on FIFOQueues of different experiments

Hi,
I am running some experiments with Tensorflow on a 4-GPU machine using CIFAR10 with the FIFOQueue implementation for input data pipeline.
I want to simultaneously run one different instance of my experiment on each of the four GPUs,
but because the data processing queues are always places on the CPU I get an OutOfRange error and
cannot run more than one instance per machine.
Is there a way to overcome this? (other than placing the data processing on GPUs)
Thanks
