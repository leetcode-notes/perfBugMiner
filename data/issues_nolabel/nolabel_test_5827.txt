Should variables in ExponentialMovingAverage use "get_variable"

zero_debias for moving average was introduced recently on master branches.  (tensorflow/tensorflow/python/training/moving_averages.py)
Variables in func “_zero_debias” is created by "variable_scope.get_variable", while slot_creator creates moving variable with "variables.Variable". This causes some problem when outer scope set “reuse=True”, if we only want to reuse variables of the network but not the moving averages.
At least, the new feature introduces inconsistency on how to maintain moving variables.
