Bug/Feature: constant_folding FP16

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
RHEL 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
('v1.3.0-rc1-6207-ge210cb1', '1.4.0')
Python version:
python2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
bazel 0.9.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
gcc 4.8
Exact command to reproduce:

python tensorflow/models/tutorial/images/convolutional.py --use_fp16
Describe the problem
When using FP16 in e.g. the case listed above, the following error occurs:
E tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc:1272] Unexpected type half
E tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc:1242] Unexpected type half
When looking into constant_folding.cc, i found out FP16 support exists at given lines, but is commented out.
Why is this not yet included in Tensorflow?
As far as I can see, this is more of a feature request than a bug report, since these code lines simply check if computational effort can be reduced (if the matrix is zero or one)
Also when using above command, the model trains until step 1100, then the learning rate drops to 0 (a known FP16 problem). Still it's annoying to encounter this in an official tutorial file.
