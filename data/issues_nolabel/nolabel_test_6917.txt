How to init the graph once and reuse the graph to serve all the requests

I want to provide a restful api or rpc for client to input some pictures and output their features, but every request will start a new graph and load all train variables from the disk, and this is very slow, how can I init the graph once and reuse the graph to serve all the requests, Thank You for your help
