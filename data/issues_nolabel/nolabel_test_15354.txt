CPU: Support for DT_STRING type in ScatterNd

The PR is proposed to fix #15321.
However, the solution seems not idea. Because ScatterNdOP use ADD op by default, which doesn't make sense for string type. I prefer to use ASSIGN than ADD, but the modification will change the op's behavior.
How to test

 add test.
  pass all tests.
