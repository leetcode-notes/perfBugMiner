Feature request: Possible to introduce tf.complex32 datatype

Just recently I figured out, that our GPU (TitanX 12GB) is not big enough of its memory capacities to process our data. I was wondering whether there are attempts to "quantize" the complex datatypes as well.
I've seen that there are approaches to quantize float32 datatypes for example and was wondering if this is possible for real/imag types as well.
Thanks a lot!
