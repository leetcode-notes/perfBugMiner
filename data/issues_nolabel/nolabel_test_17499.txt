Problem with the tensorflow installation

I'm having problems installing the cpu-only version of tensorflow, for this I use pip3, my OS is w10, I tried it with python 3.6.4 and 3.5.2 and in no case did it work, here is the error that generates me, besides the response to the script whose answer I do not understand, tells me that I do not have the dll's and all those things, but I installed was the version of only CPU, are these files required? ah and yes, I installed it with administrator permissions both the python and the tensorflow. . .



import tensorflow as tf

ERROR: Failed to import the TensorFlow module.
WARNING! This script is no longer maintained!
Since TensorFlow 1.4, the self-check has been integrated with TensorFlow itself,
and any missing DLLs will be reported when you execute the import tensorflow
statement. The error messages printed below refer to TensorFlow 1.3 and earlier,
and are inaccurate for later versions of TensorFlow.


Python version is 3.6.


TensorFlow is installed at: C:\Program Files\Python36\lib\site-packages\tensorflow


Could not load 'cudart64_80.dll'. The GPU version of TensorFlow
requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in
your %PATH% environment variable. Download and install CUDA 8.0 from
this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit


Could not load 'nvcuda.dll'. The GPU version of TensorFlow requires that
this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH%
environment variable. Typically it is installed in 'C:\Windows\System32'.
If it is not present, ensure that you have a CUDA-capable GPU with the
correct driver installed.


Could not load 'cudnn64_5.dll'. The GPU version of TensorFlow
requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in
your %PATH% environment variable. Note that installing cuDNN is a
separate step from installing CUDA, and it is often found in a
different directory from the CUDA DLLs. You may install the
necessary DLL by downloading cuDNN 5.1 from this URL:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn


Could not find cuDNN.
