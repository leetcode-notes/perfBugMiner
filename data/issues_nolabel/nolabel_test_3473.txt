Incompatibility with Python modules that mutually import each other

I came across the following issue. It probably isn't very urgent.
Environment info
I can produce the following error on:

Operating System: OS X El Capitan, 10.11.3 (15D21)
Ubuntu 14.04 (the default Ubuntu AMI on EC2)

I am using the CPU version of TensorFlow, installed from
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, CPU only, Python 2.7
$ export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.9.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

> python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"
0.9.0

Steps to reproduce


Create file1.py with contents:
import file2 # Can also reproduce the error with a single file by having file1 import itself
import tensorflow as tf # The order of these two imports doesn't matter
sess = tf.Session() # Removing the assignment fixes the problem


Create file2.py with contents
import file1


Then run
> python file1.py
Exception AttributeError: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'raise_exception_on_not_ok_status'" in <bound method Session.__del__ of <tensorflow.python.client.session.Session object at 0x1172b7cd0>> ignored
