Unable to save the wide and deep model in a tensorflow session

I am running the wide and deep model in TensorFlow serving and to export the trained model I am using the piece of code

But while using the command saver = tf.train.Saver() the error ValueError: No variable to save is displayed

How can I save the model, so that a servable is created which is required while loading the exported model in tensorflow standard server? Any help is appreciated.
