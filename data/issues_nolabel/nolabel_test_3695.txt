Added code to raise ValueError if parent directory of  path Saver.saveâ€¦

Current version of Saver.save(session, path) fails with a rather mysterious error code when parent directory of path doesn't exist. It throws a NotFoundError, listing a bunch of nodes variables, e.g.:
(...)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: /tmp/tensorflow/autoencoder/cifar/cifar.ckpt.tempstate2833829603959566611
   [[Node: save/save = SaveSlices[T=[DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](_recv_save/Const_0, save/save/tensor_names, save/save/shapes_and_slices, Variable, Variable/Adam, Variable/Adam_1, beta1_power, beta2_power, biases, biases/Adam, biases/Adam_1, biases_1, biases_1/Adam, biases_1/Adam_1)]]

This makes user believe problem is with some ops not being found by Saver object and doesn't point to path problem at all.
I added code that checks that parent folder of output path exists and if not, fails with a ValueError and appropriate message.
