[Feature request] np.random.choice analogue

TF has no analogue to np.random.choice function that chooses random element from tensor (optionally according to provided probabilities). It's especially useful in RL problems when you use epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.

These two solve the problem using tf.multinomial, but maybe it will be convenient to include tf.random_choice in TF API?
It could be implemented through tf.multinomial , for example.
