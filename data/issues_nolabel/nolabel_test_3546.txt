iOS: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Div' with these attrs

I'm trying to build graph in iOS but i have following error:
Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Div' with these attrs
     [[Node: conv1/conv/moments/sufficient_statistics/truediv = Div[T=DT_DOUBLE](conv1/conv/moments/sufficient_statistics/truediv/Cast, conv1/conv/moments/sufficient_statistics/truediv/Cast_1)]]

In Python if I run this code:
batch_mean, batch_var = tf.nn.moments(x, [0, 1, 2], keep_dims=True)
I'm getting the error above, otherwise works fine.
I'm trying to find ops (core/ops, core/kernels).
