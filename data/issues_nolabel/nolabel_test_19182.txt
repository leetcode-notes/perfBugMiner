pandas_input_fn taking a DataFrame or dict of Series for y

Pandas Input Function for Multilabel Inputs
tf.estimator.inputs.pandas_input_fn should be able to take a DataFarme or a dict with key to Series for y. This would allow multi-label inputs. This is similar to the numpy_input_fn behavior implemented in issue #12610.
I'd be happy to give the implementation a shot.
