Add missing sparse base columns definitions and change parameter name

There are couple of issues which prevent the code from tutorial to run immediately after copy-pasting:

build_estimator() is missing definitions of two sparse base columns ("race" and "marital status")
"dense_shape" parameter is named "shape" when creating SparseTensor in input_fn()
