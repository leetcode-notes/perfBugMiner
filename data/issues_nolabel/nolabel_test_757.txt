Tensor indexing issue

How to make confusion matrix with tensorflow?
is it possible or is there any work-around for the
following code
nb_classes = 4
nb_samples = 10
a_ = np.random.randint(0, high=nb_classes, size=(nb_samples,))
b_ = np.random.randint(0, high=nb_classes, size=(nb_samples,))

conf_mat = tf.zeros([nb_classes, nb_classes], tf.int32)

for i in xrange(nb_samples):
    #conf_mat[a[i]][b[i]] += 1
    # above one gives error so I tried to use gather
    # from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/418
    # but problem with it is that we can't set the values
    # with gather
    tf.gather(tf.gather(conf_mat, a[i]), b[i]) += 1

init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
with tf.Session as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    sess.run(conf_mat, feed_dict={a=a_, b=b_})

The error I am getting is
tf.gather(tf.gather(conf_mat, a[i]), b[i]) += 1
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
