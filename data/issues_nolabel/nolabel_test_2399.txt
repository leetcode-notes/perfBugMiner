Is it possible to add summaries to an existing event file ?

When I continue to train my model from last interrupted training, tf.train.SummaryWriter create a new event file.
Could I add new summaries to my existing event file?  So I can visualize the whole learning run.
P.S. What's the right way to suspend the training binary on GPU?   We share one GPU, and I always use  "Ctrl+c" ……
