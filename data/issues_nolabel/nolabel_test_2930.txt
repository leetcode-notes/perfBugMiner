Is contrib/quantization available through Python interface?

It works in C++ if I build label_image example but if I call through python, I got:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: Op type not registered 'QuantizeV2'
Is there any build file I need to update? I tested on RC0.9 release. Thanks.
