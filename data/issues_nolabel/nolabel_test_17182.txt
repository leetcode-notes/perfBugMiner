Problem description
I use tf.contrib.training.evaluate_repeatedly function found here: 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/evaluation.py
    
    
         Line 345
      in
      37aa430
    
    
    
    

        
          
           def evaluate_repeatedly(checkpoint_dir, 
        
    
  


The two parameters that are relevant here are:
timeout=1, timeout_fn=my_timeout_fn, where my_timeout_fn is a custom function and returns True or False. Basically I want to stop evaluation loop if some condition is met, in which case the function will return 1. I have to set timeout to some small value, in this case 1 sec, so that timeout_fn is triggered often. The issue with this is that I get the next log message very often:
Waiting for new checkpoint at /path/to/dir

I set timeout=10, but still I don't want to see that useless log message every 10 seconds.
The message comes from here:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/evaluation.py
    
    
         Line 192
      in
      37aa430
    
    
    
    

        
          
           logging.info('Waiting for new checkpoint at %s', checkpoint_dir) 
        
    
  


One of the solutions would be to put this logging command inside the caller of wait_for_new_checkpoint function and execute it once before while True loop on  line 248, and then right after yield checkpoint_path on line 264. This way we get this message only after a checkpoint is found.
