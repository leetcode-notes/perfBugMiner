Cannot build Tensorflow with XLA, but without GPU support

I believe it is probably commit 191658d
To be clear, this is when I build without configuring CUDA at the ./configure stage.   I have not tried to configure with CUDA but then build without the --config=cuda.
Here is the final few lines of the build output:

You can see that the cuda libraries are included in the build, and that the linker is complaining that the .so (.dylib) files are empty, which is true.
Maybe this is a problem with the OS/X linker  which might object to empty .so files where other operating systems' linkers do not.
For me,  this is is a high priority issue.
