upgrades to boosted_trees: an example with feature importance + tuning + savedmodel

Describe the problem
Feature Request: I hate to make a trite request, but is there any plan to add more documentation or examples to the tensorflow.contrib.boosted_trees submodule? Now that there's a GB classifier available, I am hoping to replace my production XGBoost code with boosted_trees as soon as I can prove it out. Perhaps it's my newness to tf.contrib.learn's Estimators and Experiments, but I found the examples a bit opaque and repetitive. For example, would it be possible to have an example script demonstrating these properties:

some feature importance metrics (I see the Hooks but don't know how to use them)
some type of hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, examples_per_layer, etc.)
the implementation of an ExportStrategy in the Experiment; or better yet, throw away the experiment and directly operate on a trained Estimator. I'm struggling to write a proper serving input function
a (perhaps commented out) example of using each input in the GradientBoostedTreeClassifier constructor

Sorry to ask for hand-holding here. It's just taking me longer than usual to figure these things out from the source code.
Also, to the extent that I've figured out some of these, are you welcoming PRs for more thorough examples?
