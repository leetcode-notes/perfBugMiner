reshuffle_each_iteration args now default to True

The documentation for the tf.Dataset.data.shuffle function states the following:


reshuffle_each_iteration: (Optional.) A boolean, which if true indicates that the dataset should be pseudorandomly reshuffled each time it is iterated over. (Defaults to True.)


However, the default value in the function is None:
def shuffle(self, buffer_size, seed=None, reshuffle_each_iteration=None):

The function calls the ShuffleDataset class, whose __init__ function also sets the same argument to None by default, and uses the following logic to set the default value of the argument to True:
if reshuffle_each_iteration is None:
  self._reshuffle_each_iteration = True
else:
  self._reshuffle_each_iteration = reshuffle_each_iteration

This commit sets the argument to True by default in both the function and the class, making the above code block redundant and replacing it with only self._reshuffle_each_iteration = reshuffle_each_iteration.
