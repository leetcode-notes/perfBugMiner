If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".

the above command fails, with AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'version'however, the version is 0.8.0

pip freeze:
tensorflow==0.8.0

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
Steps to reproduce

start with  the example tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/skflow/text_classification_cnn.py
use GTX 980
modify example steps fairly large number (e.g. 2400)
modify EMBEDDING_SIZE to 16
modify N_FILTERS to 16
modify WINDOW_SIZE to 32.
run until crash

What have you tried?

various step numbers.  The default (100) does not crash, various other step crash eventually with larger number crashing sooner.  Perhaps this is a memory leak or other general failure to maintain datastructures.
various values for the above variables some combinations work some don't.
