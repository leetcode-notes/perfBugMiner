Wheels are far behind on tensorflow.org

Hi there,
I'm new to GitHub contributions so let me know if I'm wrong in posting this here.
I have installed both TensorFlows (CPU and GPU) on Ubuntu 14.04 using pip. I faced many problems and then realized that the wheels on the TensorFlow website are quite outdated. The source on GitHub is moving really quickly. In particular, the GPU version does not have stuff like the configure file, among many others.
I then downloaded from source and built the wheels locally. Is there any intention to update the TensorFlow website soon? I can help to solve this issue too so let me know how I can help.
