Fixes and improvements to docker build script and dockerfiles

Clean up large Bazel build cache. Total filesystem size reduction as seen by du -sh /:
devel image: 1.5 GB (Before: 2.9 GB; After: 1.4 GB)
devel-gpu image: 2.3 GB (Before: 4.7 GB; After: 2.4 GB)
Using nvidia-docker for GPU docker build.
Upgrade Bazel version from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2.
Add missing libcurl3-dev build dependency to devel images.
Add scipy and sklearn to Dockerfile.devel-gpu to enhance consistency with other image types (e.g., Dockerfile.devel).
Remove the obsolete and unnecessary --recurse-submodules flag for git clone.

Related to GH issues: #4116 and #4117
However, not using the "git clone --depth 1" suggested by issue #4117, because the size of the git repo is only reduced by about 50 MB by the "--depth 1" flag. This space saving is small compared to the space saving due to bazel cache removal. The complete history of the git repo can be useful for certain development purposes.
