Use 'LABEL maintainer=' in Dockerfile

Use 'LABEL maintainer=' in Dockerfile

This fix is a follow up of 13961 to replace MAINTAINER
with LABEL maintainer= in Dockerfile. The keyword
MAINTAINER has long been deprecated and is replaced by LABEL,
which is much more flexible and is easily searchable through docker inspect.
This fix replaces remaining MAINTAINER with LABEL.
