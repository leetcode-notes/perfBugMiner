Describe the problem
I encounter an error related to barriers when using tf.contrib.training.batch_sequences_with_states. I use this function to batch sequences. For now, just batches of 4. I do not understand the error it but I tried empirically poking at it and it only occurs with some capacity values. For example, it does not occur within 15 minutes with a capacity value of 16 (good for 4 batches) and cycles through the input sequences as expected. It does occur within a minute with capacity values of 32 and 64.
I know this is incredibly vague but I can explore more if you can help me understand the underlying issue. I do believe this question does not fit the StackOverflow format as this is buggy behaviour.
Source code / logs
Below the error log. One thing I do not understand for example is that it always complains about components 0-8. I have verified that this occurs for multiple keys. My best guess is that this has to do with save_state trying to save over state that has already been saved?
