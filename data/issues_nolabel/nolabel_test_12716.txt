Change `dim` to `axis` for tf.nn.softmax and tf.nn.log_softmax

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #7391 where dim was not changed to axis for tf.nn.softmax and tf.nn.log_softmax.
This is inconsistent with other ops in tensorflow.
This fix adds axis while at the same time keeps dim so that backward compatibility is maintained.
This fix fixes #7391.
This fix fixes #14191.
