tf.nn.elu returns NaN

I am using a fairly straight-forward FFN with ELU activations, and getting all NaN from the network output.
This comes in the 4th training epoch so the data did not have any NaN.
Environment info
Operating System: Mac OS X 10.12.1
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: N/A. I'm using CPU version.
tensorflow version: 0.11.0rc2
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
dense_output = tf.contrib.layers.stack(input, 
                                       tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected,
                                       [config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size // 2, config.hidden_size // 3, target_size],
                                       activation_fn=tf.nn.elu,
                                       weights_initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(),
                                       scope='FFN')
