Fix word2vec excepction when words contain chinese.

When word2vec deal with Chinese language, it will break out below exception.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "word2vec_tf.py", line 58, in <module>
    main()
  File "word2vec_tf.py", line 47, in main
    model = Word2Vec(options, session)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec.py", line 166, in __init__
    self.save_vocab()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec.py", line 382, in save_vocab
    opts.vocab_counts[i]))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u90fd' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)

I fix this exception by adding encode('utf-8') , and then it successful run word2vec model.
