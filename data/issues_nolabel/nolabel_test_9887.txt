Allow tensor as iou_threshold parameter to tf.image.non_max_suppression.

I have a use case where dynamically changing the iou_threshold parameter on a frozen graph is required. I'm not 100% positive this doesn't violate the backwards compatibility rules, and it does make the iou_threshold a required parameter. Feedback from the maintainers would be appreciated.
