cannot be overwritten again on class - tensorflow

Tensorflow: 1.6.0
OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
I created weights & json model using keras but when I try to load it from my code I am getting the error from tensorflow.
ValueError(operator getitem cannot be overwritten again on class <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'>.)
Initially I was loading the model from other lib & then referring it, to test I clubbed all in one place, still gets the same exception. Any idea when & why this exception occurs? Please let me know if you need any more
