Describe the problem
I get very strange behaviour of image read function. See attached screenshot from tensorboard. This is NOT a tensorboard problem as I get images as they are from Dataset object.

Source images are fine, I have attached a zip archive with source images:
Kodak.zip
import glob
import tensorflow as tf

def simply_read_image(image_path):
    image_string = tf.read_file(image_path)
    image_source = tf.image.decode_png(image_string, channels=3)
    image_source = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image_source, dtype=tf.float32)
    return image_source

validation_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(validation_folder, '*.png'))

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(validation_files)
dataset = dataset.map(simply_read_image).batch(len(validation_files)).repeat(30)

next_element = iterator.get_next()

    with tf.Session() as s:
        for i in range(30):
            im = s.run(next_element)
            for j in range(25):
                current_image = im[j]
                pass


Any current_image with portrait orientation seems to be read incorrectly.
