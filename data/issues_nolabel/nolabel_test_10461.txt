Tensor names prepended with "import/" when loaded from protobuf

When I load a (frozen) Tensorflow model from disk using:
    graph = tf.Graph()
    with graph.as_default():
        f = gfile.FastGFile("frozen_graph.pb", "rb")
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        tf.import_graph_def(graph_def)

It seems that all tensor names are prepended with import/.
This is the code I use to print the names:
with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        all_ops = sess.graph.get_operations()
        op_values =  [op.values() for op in all_ops]
        for values in op_values:
            for each in value:
                print each.name


Why? Is this some kind of default option that can be overriden? Or can I rely on this in my code? I could not find this documented anyhwere, can anybody point me to references regarding this?
