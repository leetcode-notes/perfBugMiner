Problem description
I want to create and read a tfrecord file with build_cgd_dataset.py as the writer and reader_iter.py as the reader. Everything works smooth in the workstation but it reaches a deadlock or gets stuck in the laptop. The dataset are from Cornell grasping dataset.
I narrowed down the error in this special cases where it doesn't show any problem, for example:

if it reads a int64_list with one value, so a list with one elemnet
if it reads a float_list with one element

If the lists have more than one element the program freezes.
