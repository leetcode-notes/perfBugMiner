Operating System:

ls: cannot access /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*: No such file or directory

If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

❯ python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"
1.0.0

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow.contrib
import cv_bridge

import rospy
rospy.init_node('node')
This throws the following error:
/usr/bin/python2.7 /home/ethan/.PyCharmCE2016.3/config/scratches/scratch_4.py
src/tcmalloc.cc:277] Attempt to free invalid pointer 0xa2e78616d5f7475 

Process finished with exit code 134 (interrupted by signal 6: SIGABRT)

I'll also post to stackoverflow and to the cv_bridge page (ros-perception/vision_opencv#161).
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried reinstalling ros and tensorflow. No change. I also tried print(cv_bridge.__file__) to make sure I was importing the right directory for cv_bridge.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
