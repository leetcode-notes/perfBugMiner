android demo protobuf-related build error

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
None
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
Git cloned. Tried several versions of TF. Same result.
Steps to reproduce

Clone repo here : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android
I installed SDK 24 (part of Android Studio) and NKD 10e.
Also installed build tools 23.0.1. Seemed to be required.
Followed steps on page

What have you tried?

I tried several versions of bazel and tensorflow. The error persists.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
This is my error:
C++ compilation of rule '@protobuf//:protobuf' failed: namespace-sandbox failed: error executing command /home/sander/.cache/bazel/_bazel_sander/577a8dcd97360f56540bc1f3f08ac240/tf-cat-face/_bin/namespace-sandbox ... (remaining 51 argument(s) skipped).
src/main/tools/namespace-sandbox.c:697: execvp(argv[0], argv): No such file or directory
Target //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo failed to build
Use --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.
Also, here's how I edited the WORKSPACE file.
workspace(name = "org_tensorflow")
android_sdk_repository(
name = "androidsdk",
api_level = 24,
build_tools_version = "23.0.1",
# Replace with path to Android SDK on your system
path = "/home/sander/Android/Sdk/",
)
android_ndk_repository(
name="androidndk",
path="/home/sander/Android/android-ndk-r10e/",
api_level=21)
This error is quite persistent as I've already tried many installations of both TF and Bazel. I also have a little side question: if the build succeeds, what should the output be when there is no camera attached to my PC? Should I build with my android phone plugged in via USB? Thanks!
