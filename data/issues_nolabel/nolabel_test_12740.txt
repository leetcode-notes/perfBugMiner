[Feature Request]: fold batch norm into convolution weights of graph transform tool

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0, 6.0
GPU model and memory: GTX1080
Exact command to reproduce:

bazel build tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms:transform_graph
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/transform_graph 
--in_graph=tensorflow_inception_graph.pb 
--out_graph=optimized_inception_graph.pb 
--inputs='Mul' 
--outputs='softmax' 
--transforms='
strip_unused_nodes(type=float, shape="1,299,299,3")
remove_nodes(op=Identity, op=CheckNumerics)
fold_constants(ignore_errors=true)
fold_batch_norms
fold_old_batch_norms'
After diving into the generated pb graph, I found that the current fold batch norm ops seems to only fold batch norm into two ops: mul and add, which is not exactly as the readme demonstrated: fold the batch norm into the weights of convolution. If this is the case, it would be better to further merge the mul and add into conv weights.
