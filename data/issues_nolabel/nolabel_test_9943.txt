Tensorflow Layers conv3d_transpose

I'm trying to use 3D transpose convolutions found here, but they are not available in the current build of Tensorflow when installing using pip. On another machine I was successfully able to build Tensorflow from source because I already had Bazel installed on my system, and then able to use the 3d transpose convolutions.
However, on a new machine without Bazel, I am unable to install Bazel, and therefore unable to compile Tensorflow from source. It appears that the Java project has moved. Below is the result of running sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk, as per the instructions here.

Is there a way around this, or a timeframe when the new Tensorflow Layers will be included in the pip download?
