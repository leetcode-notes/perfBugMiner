Tensors erroneously zero when an existing session is running on the same device

UPDATE: Restarting my machine fixed the issue.
To reproduce, run two processes with
import tensorflow as tf
import time
z = tf.constant([1.8, 2.2], dtype=tf.float32)
z = tf.cast(z, tf.int32)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    while True:
        print('z is', sess.run(z), 'but should be [1, 2]')
        time.sleep(1)
Second process output
z is [0 0] but should be [1, 2]
z is [0 0] but should be [1, 2]
...

Stopping the first process will fix the problem immediately without needing to restart the second process!
