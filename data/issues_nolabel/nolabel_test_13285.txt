Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

No Custom code written. Only codes that have been used are from Tensorflow official documentation  (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Windows 10 Enterprise x64 (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Tensorflow installed from cmd using pip3 install command (source or binary):
**TensorFlow with CPU support only :
Python version 3.6.2:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU Intel HD Graphics 5500 RAM 8GB, Total Graphics Memory 4161MB:
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"

After I install Tensorflow using the command pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow the installation completes without any issues. When I put in the line "import tensorflow as tf", in the pyton interactive shell I get the following error File "", line 1, in  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
