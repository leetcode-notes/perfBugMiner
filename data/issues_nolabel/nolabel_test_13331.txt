Passing CPU value along with GPU tensor

Hello, i'm trying to pass a CPU value or a block of values from one custom op into another along with a GPU tensor but the framework seems to be converting everything to GPU tensor. There doesn't seem to be a mechanism for passing mixed GPU+CPU op results right now.
