Reuse add_loss function and removed skflow folder

I don't think people are still importing from skflow, instead of importing from learn.
BTW, @martinwicke @ilblackdragon Are you in the process of removing learn.ops to avoid the duplication? What's the best way to handle (is_training in contrib.layers) and (IS_TRAINING in learn.ops.dropout_ops and learn.ops.batch_norm_ops)?
