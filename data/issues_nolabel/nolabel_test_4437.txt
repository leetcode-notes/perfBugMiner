why there are no documents about tf.nn.seq2seq

the file tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq contains models like tf.nn.seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq, but there are not any documentation about these models in the online documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn.html#neural-network)
or there is but i didn't find it?
