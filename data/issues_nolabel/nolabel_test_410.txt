Batching from two string_input_producers does that don't preserve order.

I'm trying to read in multiple files (one file consists of the input, the other is the label). I assembled a pipeline using tf.train.string_input_producer, some custom decoder and tf.train.batch to put them together to batches. Unfortunately, the order does somehow get mixed up in this process. I extracted a minimal example that uses randomly generated strings instead of filenames (and also skips the decoding step), see my gist here
In this example, all shuffling was disabled. But the error also occurs if I enabled shuffle and set the same seed for both string input producers.
Am I using these classes not as intended? Or is there an actual bug?
