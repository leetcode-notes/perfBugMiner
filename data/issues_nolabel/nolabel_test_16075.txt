optimize_for_inference_lib.fold_batch_norms() preserves data_format

fold_batch_norms() currently breaks graphs containing convolutions using NCHW data format. The function replaces a BiasAdd operation with a new one, while not preserving the data format of the original operation. As a result, the new operation always has NHWC data format, and the execution of the resulting graph fails because of mismatching dimensions.
The proposed resolution is to copy the data_format property from the original operation.
The patch fixes #15034.
