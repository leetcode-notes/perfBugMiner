Tensorflow website doesn't show older builds to install using pip

I was at tensorflow 1.4, upgraded tensorflow to 1.5, had to install cudnn 9.0 and now my system is unstable. I went to the tensorflow website in order to get the tensorflow 1.4 build and noticed that there isn't any reference for these build anymore and now I'm stuck at version 1.5.
Where are these references about the .whl files? Seems that the '.../install/install_windows' page is the same for all the versions, which suggest just an '--upgrade'.
