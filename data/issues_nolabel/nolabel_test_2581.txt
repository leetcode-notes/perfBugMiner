Implement bidirectional_dynamic_rnn (#1779)

In #1779, it seems that the problem of implementing bidirectional version of dynamic_rnn is that tf.reverse_sequence cannot reverse a sequence whose shape is unknown.
However, now it can reverse an unknown-shaped sequence according to #1816, so I implemented the dynamic version of dynamic_rnn and its tests.
