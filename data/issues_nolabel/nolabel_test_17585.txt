Tensorflow finding only 9gb of free memory but 11gb total for gtx 1080 ti GPU

We found on both Windows 10 and Linux machines that Tensorflow will only find 9gb of the 11gb available for GTX 1080 ti GPUs from both EVGA and MSI.  Having trouble finding a fix - does anyone know why it is doing this and how to fix it so it can get access to all the memory?
