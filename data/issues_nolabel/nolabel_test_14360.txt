Cannot build TF 1.4 with CUDNN 1.4

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Centos 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4
Python version: 3.4.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7.0- (@non-git)
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.9
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.0.5

Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --config=mkl //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_packag

Describe the problem
I'm trying to install Tensorflow 1.4 from sources with CUDA 8.0 and CUDNN 5.0.5. It's indicated in the documentation that it should work with CUDNN 3 and higher.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work and ends up with an error that seems to indicate that CUDNN v6 is needed (I may be wrong on the cause of the error).
Here is the error:
ERROR: /home/localuser/tensorflow/tensorflow/stream_executor/BUILD:52:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/stream_executor:cuda_platform' failed (Exit 1).

Is there anything I can do to install TF 1.4 using CUDNN 5 ?
Thanks
