why the tensorflow run slower on gpu than on cpu

The tensorflow should run faster on gpu than on cpu , however, I got the opposite result. The time cost when running on gpu is longer than on cpu.The code is as below:
    with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
        local3_value = np.load("local3.npy")
    with tf.variable_scope('local4') as scope:
        weights4 = tf.get_variable('weights',[384,192])
        biases4 = tf.get_variable('biases',[192])
        local4 = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(local3_value, weights4)+biases4, name = scope.name)

    saver = tf.train.Saver()

    with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))as sess:
        saver.restore(sess, "/tmp/cifar10_train/model.ckpt-27000")
        start_time  = time.time()
        predictions = sess.run(local4)
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        print(duration)
The variables such as weights4 and biases4 are restored from a trained model.
