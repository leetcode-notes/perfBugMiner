tensorboard server: base_url support

What have you tried?
Running the tensorboard service through a proxy server, which does map a subdirectory to the tensorboard server' root.
Desired outcome
By providing a way to specify a base_url, the server would understand how to treat incoming requests in such a situation. e.g. ://server/subdir/tensorboard/ â†’ ://server/
