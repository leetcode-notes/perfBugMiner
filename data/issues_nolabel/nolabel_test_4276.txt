Tensor name "hiddenlayer_2/biases" not found in checkpoint files model

I have created my model on one machine and then sent the zipped folder 'model' by email to myself so I would be able to use this model on my second PC.
Here is the code how I'm recreating a model:
feature_columns = learn.infer_real_valued_columns_from_input(x_train)
classifier = learn.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns, hidden_units=[40, 80, 40], n_classes=3, model_dir='model')

As I understood, to reuse a model I need to make 'fit' 1-3 steps. (This fact I found here in TF issues)
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train, steps=3)
Then when I call predicted = classifier.predict(x_test) , it throws an exception:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: Tensor name "hiddenlayer_2/biases" not found in checkpoint files model/model.ckpt-30015-?????-of-00001
This model is working well on the machine where it has been created.
How can I make it work on any PC?
Thanks!
