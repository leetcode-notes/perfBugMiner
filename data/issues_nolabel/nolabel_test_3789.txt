Fix tensorboard CSV download in Python 3

In Python 3, the csv module cannot be used with six.BytesIO (io.BytesIO in Py3) as demonstrated by this example:
from six import BytesIO
import csv

out = BytesIO()
writer = csv.writer(out)
writer.writerow(('A', 'B'))

Which under Python 3 gives:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bug.py", line 6, in <module>
    writer.writerow(('A', 'B'))
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'

This same problem happens when downloading CSV files from Tensorboard under Python 3.
This is a well-documented behavior and the solution is to change to six.StringIO (1, 2, 3). This solution works for both Python 2 and Python 3.
There was a related problem with BaseHTTPRequestHandler not accepting unicode. This is also addressed in this PR by adding a compat.as_bytes before the wfile.write call.
Note: I think the BytesIO usage in _send_gzip_response is fine, which is why I did not remove the BytesIO import.
