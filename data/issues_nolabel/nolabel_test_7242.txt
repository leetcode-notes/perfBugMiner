How to use Tensorflow in my android project?

I am working on a project, where I change the View with a button (working with Fragments). I am changing between a FirstFragment and a CamFragment. Now I want to use Tensorflow (it works on my phone) instead of CamFragment.
When I "import new Module", I get Errors only. Do you have any Tips or solutions how I can do that?
Thank You
