Odd crash in Android demo

Environment info
Android Demo from 57658ed
I've been trying to build an image classifier for android, and I ran into this exception in the TensorflowClassifier class.
I haven't run into this before despite playing with this for a few days, but I added some logging and will upload more details if I can repro it.
Not sure if anyone cares, but I thought I might as well capture this.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid float: "Android"
at java.lang.StringToReal.invalidReal(StringToReal.java:63)

at org.tensorflow.demo.TensorflowClassifier.recognizeImage(TensorflowClassifier.java:51)
FWIW the line number in recognizeImage is wrong since I've made changes to the file, but shouldn't have caused this.
[EDIT]: I found that the log message I was getting was "Android system is not using RGBA_8888 in default", I guess I'll see what that's about.
