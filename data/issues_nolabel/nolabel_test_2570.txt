Adding DecodeJpeg Op to Android results in build errors (jpeg-9a is missing)

I tried to add the jpeg libraries to the Android build so that I could easily use the model I trained using the transfer learning example, after adding the decode_jpeg_op.cc and removing the jpeg exclude from the android core libraries I ran into issues with the jpeg-9a includes from this file not being anywhere in the repo:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/jpeg.h#L26
I'm not sure if this library being missing is just an oversight or whether this is unsupported at the moment. I can probably deal with it not being there by stripping that node out of my graph, it just seems to be a random sharp edge
