Differentiate Variable (Model Parameters) and Mutable Tensor

In the current tensorflow, the concept of variables is about same as model parameters and mutable tensors. I would like to see them separate out. For example, it seems perfect legit to me to use tf.scatter_nd_update to update a tensor. However all scatter APIs require "mutable tensor". That made operations on tensors with "batch" parameter close to impossible.  Having the concept of mutable tensor will help a lot.
