Add code to close session

Hi all, I read the tensorflow tutorial and find that we must close session when finishing using it. However, when I review the code in cifar10 tutorial, I find that in some files,  there is no sess.close() line. I don't know whether it's a function of tf.app utilities, so I add the session closing code and make you know about this issue.  Hope this can be helpful.
