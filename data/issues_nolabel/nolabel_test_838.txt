fully_connected_preloaded.py on GPU trains slower then on CPU

while running examples/how_tos/reading_data/fully_connected_preloaded.py on CPU the speed of training is the following:
Step 0: loss = 2.31 (0.586 sec)
Step 100: loss = 2.22 (0.012 sec)

But, when I run this code on GPU, it hangs, seems like some blocking occurs:
Step 0: loss = 2.30 (3.961 sec)
Step 100: loss = 2.13 (2.797 sec)

Timings are meaningless here, since actually I wait more than ~3 sec for next output.
