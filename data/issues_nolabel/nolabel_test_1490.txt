Fix broken android example README link

This PR fixes the link to the WORKSPACE file, highlights the relevant sections of that file, and recommends a faster command to initialize the protobuf submodule. I'm looking forward to getting this running on my phone! (I'm working through some ndk issues. I think bazel/protobuf depends on 32-bit r10e).
