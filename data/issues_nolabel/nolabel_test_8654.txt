AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'layers'

Hi there,
The source code of tutorial

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/layers/cnn_mnist.py

cannot run on my MacAir.
It just reported: AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'layers'
Is that a version problem?
