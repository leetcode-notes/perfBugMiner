C++ API neural net examples

From looking at the code, it seems most NN operations are of course available at C++ level (I couldn't find dropout, but I guess it is formalized as one of the randomized operations).
The C++ documentation outside the code itself is rather scarce however, which I fully understand for a first release, with priority given to Python.
I wouldn't be surprised that some Googlers are actually working from the straight C++ API. Is there any plan to provide some more straightforward toy applications in C++ ? If not, please just ignore and close this issue.
Otherwise, I am interested in any pointers and I can help rewriting stuff such as seq2seq and rnn from the C++ point of view. One of the useful cornerpoints to look at could be the intersection of the Python API with the underlying C++ engine, but I haven't been able to locate it clearly yet.
