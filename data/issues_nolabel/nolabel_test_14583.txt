contrib.slim.conv2d doesn't check input dimension

tensorflow version: v1.4.0-rc1-11-g130a514 (installed from pip)
contrib.slim.conv2d doesn't check for input dimensionality. So if you give it a 5D tensor it instead performs a 3D convolution.
Here is a quick way to see this:
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

image_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,
                          shape=(None, None, 10, 10),
                          name='image')
image = tf.expand_dims(image_ph, -1)
conv = tf.contrib.slim.conv2d(image, 3, 3, padding="VALID")

sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
conv_out = conv.eval({image_ph: np.random.random((16, 20, 10, 10))})

conv_out will have shape [16, 18, 8, 8, 3], meaning that the time dimension (dim 1) has decreased due to the VALID padding.
As a side note I think it would be convenient if all conv2d implementations let you specify which dimensions to act on (or acted on the last 3 dims of the input by default). This is useful for example if you have sequential data and want to apply a 2d convolution to each frame independently.
