CI nightly libtensorflow stuck

@asimshankar @alextp the nightly libtensorflow build on the CI server seems to have been stuck for a few days now due to the Mac build. Is there a way to resolve this in order to have the binaries built for the recent changes to the eager C API? I'm currently cross-compiling on my machine but that is very expensive and so this would really help! Thanks a lot! :)
