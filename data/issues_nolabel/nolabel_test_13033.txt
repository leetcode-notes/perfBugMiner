Update workspace.bzl to use latest farmhash commit to support s390x

We had raised an issue in google/farmhash master earlier for big endian. However due to restructuring in the code via latest commits, the support for s390x needs to be explicitly added.
This support is added through this commit.
Now, tensorflow/workspace.bzl can be updated with this commit id for farmhash.
