No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'L2Loss' with these attrs

Hello everyone!
I'm having the following error when trying to run an iOS app I've built with tensorflow:
Non-OK-status: session->Create(graph_def) status: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'L2Loss' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:

 [[Node: L2Loss_1 = L2Loss[T=DT_FLOAT](sub_1)]]

I've build tensorflow using the ./build_all_ios.sh process.
From my research I already tried adding the flag -DANDROID_TYPES=ANDROID_TYPES_FULL to the build_all_ios.sh like this:
TF_CC_FLAGS="-O3 -DANDROID_TYPES=ANDROID_TYPES_FULL"
But I still have the same issue.
I was having even more errors before but I added a couple .cc files to tf_op_files.txt and it fixed those previous issues.
Do I have to add more .cc files ?
Also isn't it weird that it says I have no registered kernels ?
I'm using the latest master.
Thank you
