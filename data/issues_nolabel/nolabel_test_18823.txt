Variables in tf.contrib.autograph

This question is regarding creating tf.Variables inside an autograph function.
The semantics that we have been trying are:
def func():
   v = []
   autograph.utils.set_element_type(v, tf.int32)
   v.extend([0.5, 0.1])
   return v.stack()

# And then:
t = autograph.to_graph(func)

However, now the return value of the function is an op, not a variable. The question is, how do I get the variable v as a tf.Variable "out of" my autograph function?
