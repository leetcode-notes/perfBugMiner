Some Tensorboard metadata unsearchable

Environment Info
Ubuntu 16.04
Tensorflow installed from pip, TF version 1.0.
Potential Bug
I'm using Tensorboard's embedding projector to perform PCA/t-SNE on a dataset of features I've extracted from ~4K MIDI files. I've created a metadata TSV and pointed my Tensorflow application to it as instructed in the documentation. The metadata parses correctly in Tensorboard, however, when I use the inspector on the right-most panel, many of the fields seem to be unsearchable, or at least yield zero results for any valid query. Searching the first 13 fields (columns) works correctly, however 3 of the last fields are unsearchable, specifically artist_terms, artist_mbtags,  and artist_location in embedding_logdir/metadata.tsv.
I'm finding this to be the case independent of whether regex mode is enabled or disabled. I can also confirm that these fields are being parsed correctly as I can select a data point and view the values for these problematic fields. I've also tried creating a metadata file with only those three problematic fieldnames and they continue to misbehave in this test as well.
Reproducing
I've attached my logdir complete with a checkpoint and metadata.tsv. To reproduce my results, extract the folder and launch Tensorboard from inside embedding_logdir's parent directory like so:
tensorboard --logdir embedding_logdir

Tensorboard must be run from the parent directory of embedding_logdir to maintain the correct filepath I specified for the metadata.tsv file in my TF program.
