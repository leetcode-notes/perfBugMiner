installing tensorflow to a local folder results in import error with realtive paths

this is on linux with python 3.6.2 and tf 1.3
i install tensorflow into a folder named 'site-packages' inside my project. i then add it to the path with a relative reference. works fine when path is absolute
pip install tensorflow -t site-packages
python
import sys
sys.path.insert(1,"site-packages") # will fail
#sys.path.insert(1,"/home/absolute_path/site-packages") #works
