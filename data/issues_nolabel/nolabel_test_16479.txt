Does 1.5.0 not suppurt CUDA 9.1? It worked with CUDA 9.0 but not 9.1

I installed 1.5.0, and tying to import tensorflow, but it said that 'cannot find cudart64_90.dll'.
Then I installed the CUDA 9.0, and then everything works fine.
So I want to make sure than does 1.5.0 not support CUDA 9.1 or I have something installed wrong?
