libcupti.so missing from Docker.gpu

Environment info:
The latest docker GPU image.
gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
Issue:
While running mnist_with_summaries.py, you get
tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:119] Couldn't open CUDA library libcupti.so. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64:
Temporary Solution:
Adding the path to CUPTI to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64"
Solution:
Add ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Dockerfile.gpu, as in #7206
