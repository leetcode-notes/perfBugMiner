Add int64 axis support for reduction ops.

This fix is a follow up to PR #13863. In PR #13863 the program crash is fixed if int64 axis is passed to reduction ops,e.g. reduce_sum, reduce_max, etc. However, it does not process the case of int64 axis support, it merely fixes the crash.
This fix adds the support for int64 axis of reduction ops: reduce_sum, reduce_prod, reduce_mean, reduce_max, reduce_min, reduce_all reduce_any.
Test cases have been added as well.
