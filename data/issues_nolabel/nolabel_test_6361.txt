Using Multiple CPU Threads in an op

Hi all,
I'm interested in using multithreading within a CPU op to increase speed. More specifically, I have some linear algebra code which, for batched matrix multiplies, is much faster than MKL (and probably Eigen).
I should be able to get the corresponding GPU version working without much trouble.
Currently my code uses OpenMP and SIMD pragmas which, as I understand it, don't play nicely with tensorflow at the moment. I've been digging through the documentation all day but haven't found any examples of a CPU op with multithreading (that isn't just calling eigen) which I can use.
Could anyone please point me in the right direction here?
Cheers!
