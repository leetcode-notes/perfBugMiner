DNNClassifier estimator cannot be exported

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

tensorflow/tensorflow:latest container
ubuntu linux
installed from pip
TensorFlow version 'v1.2.0-5-g435cdfc', '1.2.1':
Python 2.7:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):

Exact command to reproduce
classifier = DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns,
                         hidden_units=[10, 20, 10],
                         n_classes=3,
                         model_dir=model_path)

classifier.export_savedmodel(MODEL_PATH, script.serving_input_receiver_fn)
Describe the problem
Trying to export the model DNNClassifier throws the exception:
Exception during training: A default input_alternative must be provided.
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "algo.py", line 78, in train
    nn.export_savedmodel(MODEL_PATH, script.serving_input_receiver_fn, default_output_alternative_key=None)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py", line 1280, in export_savedmodel
    actual_default_output_alternative_key)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/utils/saved_model_export_utils.py", line 259, in build_all_signature_defs
    raise ValueError('A default input_alternative must be provided.')
The problem happens because DNNClassifier constructor creates a head with name None: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/dnn.py#L365
