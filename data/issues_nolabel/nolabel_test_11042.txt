There is a missing line in the sample code provide for Custom Model:
After this line
input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x": x_train}, y_train, 4, num_epochs=1000).
in sample code there should be one more line for variable eval_input_fn which is missing right now in the docs.
single line of code to be added in sample code is
eval_input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x": x_eval}, y_eval,4, num_epochs=1000)
