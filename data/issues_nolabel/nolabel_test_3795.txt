Unable to connect jupyter notebook within tensorflow container in AWS

Currently we found that the tensorflow/tensorflow does not work in AWS. I can access the port and open the jupyter website but could not connect to the kernel.


The logs of that container look like these.

It doesn't work even if I try with --net=host. But it works for my local Linux server. The logs look like similar and I'm not sure if it is related to AWS's network or jupyter's configuration.

Environment info
Operating System: AWS ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow 0.9
Steps to reproduce

docker run -p 30100:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow in AWS instances
Go to $ip:30100 in the browser
Click any notebook

What have you tried?

Trying in local Linux server rather than AWS instances should work.
