Android version of TensorFlow is missing dequantize operation

Environment info
Operating System: macOS Sierra, building for Android API 19
Minimal reproducible example
Any graph that uses either of these operations. Using the quantization tool at tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph will add quantize and dequantize ops to a graph, which will subsequently not work on Android.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Building with the makefile module.
