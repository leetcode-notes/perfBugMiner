Tensorflow works, but cannot import tensorflow.python

Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
Tensorflow version: tensorflow-gpu 1.0.1 on python3.6

import tensorflow.python
import tensorflow.python as py
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'python'




I also tested importing the other tensorflow folders, with the below results:



import tensorflow.contrib as con
import tensorflow.core as core
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'core'
import tensorflow.examples as examples
import tensorflow.include as include
import tensorflow.models as models
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.models'
import tensorflow.tensorboard as tb
import tensorflow.tools as tools



For me, it seems like I can't import tensorflow.core, tensorflow.models, and tensorflow.python. Tensorflow.python in particular is the module that I am trying to use.
Any idea why this is happening? I may be missing something obvious.
Thanks so much for the help!
