[1.2.0 rc2] Tensorboard does not show graph on Windows 10

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):

I used the following minimal example:
import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(4)
c = a+b
with tf.Session() as sess:
  Writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("Test", sess.graph)
  Writer.close()

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

I installed the wheel: https://ci.tensorflow.org/job/tf-master-win-gpu-cmake/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/cmake_build/tf_python/dist/tensorflow_gpu-1.2.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
Which is the build "694" on Jenkins of the job "tf-master-win-gpu-cmake"
On version 1.1 (provided by pip), the graph was shown correctly. I needed to update to this version to get text-events in Tensorboard.

TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0-rc2 (build 694 of job "tf-master-win-gpu-cmake")
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1
GPU model and memory: GTX680 with 4 GB
Exact command to reproduce:

tensorboard --logdir=Test

If I use "inspect" I get the following output:
tensorboard --logdir=Test --inspect

I'm using Chrome Browser for Tensorboard (Firefox does not show anything for that version).
