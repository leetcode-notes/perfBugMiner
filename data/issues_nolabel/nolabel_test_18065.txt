Feature request : warning for feeding unused values

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): custom
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1
Python version:  3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
(It's not a bug. Just a feature discussion)
Probably it would be reasonable to add some kind of warnings for situations when the value you feed, is never used within computation?
Example:
a = tf.abs(2)
b = 2 * a
#a = tf.identity(a, name='a')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run([a, b], feed_dict={a: 3}))

In this everything works fine.  However if 3d line will be uncommented the feeded value will be useless. It can lead to hard debugging.
Probably it would we useful to add some warnings?
Thanx
