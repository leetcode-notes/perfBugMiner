Numerical differences between self.test_session and regular sessions?

I'm trying to use the test suite to create tests that verify various aspects of my model. Strangely, I'm getting numerical differences between the exact same model run on the exact same machine if I use self.test_session inside tf.test.TestCase versus if I just run the same piece of code in a regular session. Most models work fine, it's just that certain flavors that use dropout show big discrepancies, usually after 4 or 5 steps of training. Is this expected behavior? If so what's the cause of the discrepancy and can it be removed?
