Loading tensorflow before scipy.misc seems to cause imread to fail

If I load tensorflow before loading scipy.mics, scipy.misc.imread seems to return PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile.
E.g. if I write
import tensorflow as tf
import scipy.misc

im = scipy.misc.imread('1.jpg')

im will be something like array(<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=178x218 at 0x7F85ED8AA050>, dtype=object).
However, if I write
import scipy.misc
import tensorflow as tf

im = scipy.misc.imread('1.jpg')

im will be a normal array with dtype=uint8.
Why loading tensorflow first causes scipy.misc.imread to fail? I suppose this loading order should not matter.
I was building from source with commit 945a4b4cd12df0fdf3f0cc24b128bb4ce66ebf88. I don't think I had this problem with older versions.
