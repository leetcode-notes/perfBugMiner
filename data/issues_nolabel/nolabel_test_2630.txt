Getting "readlink: illegal option -- f" when switching builds in MacOS

I'm running into this error when building my targets with regular config, and after that trying to build with config=cuda in the same directory on latest MacOS (10.11.5) and bazel (0.2.3-homebrew). A work-around is to git-clone into a new directory, and build there with config=cuda

This is probably because the genrule actually didn't create this output, or because the output was a directory and the genrule was run remotely (note that only the contents of declared file outputs are copied from genrules run remotely).
