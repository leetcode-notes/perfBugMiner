Initial SRU Implementation

Hi, as per #13094, I'm submitting an initial PR for SRU implementation. I have checked the results with implementation here.
I intend to implement SRUBlock as well; but I have been distracted away by other high priority things until recently. So I will incrementally add the SRUBlock here as well.
In addition, it occurs to me that SRU only allows num_units equal to input_size. Can someone verify my interpretation? Otherwise we cannot perform equaiton 7 in the paper because of last-dimension size mismatch.
