Batch normalization layer has new name for each call to `__init__`

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OSX 10.12.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: no GPU
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28])
x_test = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28])
normalized_x = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x, training=True, reuse=None)
normalized_x_test = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x_test, training=False, reuse=True)
Describe the problem
This is the error I get:
ValueError: Variable batch_normalization_1/beta does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?

However, I can fix it by setting the name of the batch normalization layer. I think the default behavior should not set a new name each time I create a new batch normalization layer (even if it's an easy thing to debug).
Source code / logs
Working piece of code:
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28])
x_test = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28])
normalized_x = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x, training=True, reuse=None, name="batch_normalization")
normalized_x_test = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x_test, training=False, reuse=True, name="batch_normalization")
