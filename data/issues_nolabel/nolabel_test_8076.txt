New Build causes Illegal instruction on Import in Python 2.7 and 3.4

I built tensorflow with gpu support for python 2.7 and 3.4 using CUDA 8.0 and CUDNN 5.1, running oo Linux.
On import of tensorflow installed with the wheels I built I get an 'Illegal Instruction' error and python quits.
Can someone confirm if this is an error on my part or if is an issue with the current build?
