There is no work_sharder file in tensorflow/core/framework

I am reading the Add a new op section in official website. There is a link https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/core/framework/work_sharder.h, and this link is 404 not found. Then i tried to find the work_shader.h in tensorflow/tensorlfow/core/framework, and i failed. where can i find work_sharder.h file and detailed documentation of it ?
Thx.
