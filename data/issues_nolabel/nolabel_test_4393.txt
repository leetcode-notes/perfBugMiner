AttributeError: 'GFile' object has no attribute 'Size'

Getting above error when running mnist_softmax.py
(tensorflow) :~/softwares/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist$  python mnist_softmax.py
Temporary work around would be to do following edit in the "tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/base.py"
Replace  Line # 160    '    size = f.Size()  '        with       '   size = f.size()  '
As 'tensorflow/tensorflow/python/lib/io/file_io.py' has the function define for size not Size.
def size(self):
"""Returns the size of the file."""
return stat(self.__name).length
Failure is seen on running the tensorflow for the first time or cleaning up /tmp/data
