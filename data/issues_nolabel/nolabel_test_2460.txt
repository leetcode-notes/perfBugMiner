set_random_seed with a value too large for an int fails during later call to random()

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:  No CUDA
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: 7d9ab3e
Steps to reproduce
import tensorflow as tf
tf.set_random_seed(2 ** 70)
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
tf.random_normal((1,)).eval()
Fails with "Value out of range" exception on eval.
I'd would prefer that it would either fail on tf.set_random_seed or just truncate the seed to fit into the field (as this would be semantically correct behavior). Which one should be a correct one? I'd like to make a PR to fix it.
