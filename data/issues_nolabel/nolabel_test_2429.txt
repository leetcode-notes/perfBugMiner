TypeError: List of Tensors when single Tensor expected when using tf.pack()

I  get a confusion problem. I can run  code well on my computer. But when I copy the code to the cluster and run it. I get the error: TypeError: List of Tensors when single Tensor expected. on this line outputs = tf.pack(outputs).  The input of pack function should be list. That is so wired. Why? The version of TF on cluster is 0.8.
