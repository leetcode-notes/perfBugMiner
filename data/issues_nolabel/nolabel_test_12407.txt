Added a library to convert TensorFlow GraphDef to XLA SessionModule.

I have only added the minimal code without lot of comments. I wanted to make sure this approach is acceptable. I have made the xlagen library public, so a python library can be built externally by using TensorFlow as a submodule. Please let me know if this is acceptable and I will spruce up the PR with more documentation, comments, and tests.
