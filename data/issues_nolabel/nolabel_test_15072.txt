Have to reinstall numpy

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
Before I installed tensorflow, I have installed numpy through anaconda. But after I run the command provided in the website (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows), it automatically reinstalled numpy. Then when I import numpy or tensorflow, I got an import error "cannot import name 'add_newdocs'" which is required when importing numpy. I have to reinstall my numpy through anaconda to solve this problem.
Source code / logs
