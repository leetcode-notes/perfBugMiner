TensorFlow Convolution Code Optmization

I am using C++ version of TensorFLow and have built 'TensorFlow for Android' successfully using below command
'bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo'
as described in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android#bazel
I am trying to optimize the convolution code. Below are the issues faced


Unable to find the exact location of convolution code.
I am able to debug the code till below function in
'return choose(
Cond<internal::traits::Layout == ColMajor>(),
kernel.reshape(kernel_dims)
.contract(input
.extract_image_patches(
kernelRows, kernelCols, row_stride, col_stride,
row_in_stride, col_in_stride, padding_type)
.reshape(pre_contract_dims),
contract_dims)
.reshape(post_contract_dims),
input
.extract_image_patches(kernelRows, kernelCols, row_stride, col_stride,
row_in_stride, col_in_stride, padding_type)
.reshape(pre_contract_dims)
.contract(kernel.reshape(kernel_dims), contract_dims)
.reshape(post_contract_dims));'


as present in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/eigen_spatial_convolutions.h
I have few questions related to the above function.
1.1 Is the above function really performing convolution ? If so where is the code ?
1.2 Is contraction (contract function ) same as convolution ? If both convolution and contraction are same, why is the contract operation being performed to both input and kernel matrix ?
1.3 Where are the definitions of functions - choose, reshape, contract ,extract image patches etc ?

Unable to extract data (matrices ) from input and kernel matrix .This is in reference to the same page
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/eigen_spatial_convolutions.h

2.1 I have found a line of code 'kern(kernel);' at line no 946 in the above page. Can I know the location definition of the above function ?
2.2 I am unable to extract input and kernel matrices from the corresponding 4d tensors(input and kernel) as a float array, as i would like to try optimizing the convolution code using parallel processing.I have looked at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/tensor  but I coudn'yt find any method to convert Tensor Matrices from Tensor 4D to an array.
Please help me in answering the above questions
