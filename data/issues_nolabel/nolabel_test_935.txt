Python PIP test-on-install

PIP package is built and installed in a Docker container. Then the Python unit tests in the TF source are moved to a separate folder and ran with the plain Python environment without Blaze.
Four out of 151 tests were skipped for now due to dependency on modules in TF source that are not publicly exported.
Tests performed: Jenkins experimental builds for CPU and GPU Python test-on-install, see passing results at:
