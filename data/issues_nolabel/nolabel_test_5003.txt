C API crashes on simple problems

I am trying to incorporate Tensorflow into a larger OS X project, so using the stand-alone static library build (from contrib/makefile) and C API.
Once all the linking issues are resolved, the simplest Tensorflow programs compile fine, but do not run. I have so far found two issues when creating operations similarly to the c_api_test file:

When adding a constant Operation, Tensorflow crashes on exit from TF_SetAttrTensor(). The issue is that the managed buffer is deallocated, but still has refcount of 1. I am not sure why this happens since the managed buffer should supposedly be passed to the node_builder (which should retain the reference), but the buffer still gets deallocated.
Trying to work around that, it almost immediately hits another issue: TF_FinishOperation crashes because node_builder.Finalize call does not set the props of the Node and so ret->name() returns NULL.

I do not know the codebase well enough (just started today), so perhaps you could point me to a possible underlying cause.
Using OS X 10.11.6, Xcode 8, libc++ and C++14. Tensorflow current as of October 16.
