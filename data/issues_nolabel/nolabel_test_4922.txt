Android: read model file from arbitrary directory rather than from assets folder

Currently, TensorFlowInferenceInterface's method initializeTensorFlow() and its underlying C implementation (in tensorflow_inference_jni.cc and jni_utils.cc) require the usage of Android's AssetManager in order to read model files stored in the assets folder.
How can we modify TF's code to provide an alternative way to run the classification using a model file that's not stored in the assets folder (i.e. a location described by a File object, or by a String path pointing to another location outside the assets folder).
Is there branch where someone might be working on this? I have poor C skills so as to make such change by myself, but maybe I can work on something with some guidance.
Thanks.
Bruno.
