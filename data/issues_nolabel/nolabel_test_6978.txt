OpenCL Support for TensorFlow -- When is official support coming for macOS?

When will an official build of TensorFlow for the latest release be available for use with OpenCL-enabled graphics cards?  Should I fork a version and then hope to commit?  Is this something the core team is interested in because I have a NVIDIA-enabled iMac that is >3 years old and I cannot accelerate my computation for different projects.  What is possible within the next year?
