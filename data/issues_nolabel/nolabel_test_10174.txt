Register GPU RefExit kernel

It looks like the code was all set up to support a GPU kernel for RefExit (as was done for similar kernels, e.g. RefEnter), but RefExit was never actually registered for the GPU.  I'm not sure if it was intentionally left out for some reason, or if this was just an oversight.  All I did was add the registration calls and it appears to work.
