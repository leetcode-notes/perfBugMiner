This is the error，but  my python paths and python library path is true,python library path have numpy already.
fong@ubuntu:~/serving/tensorflow$ ./configure
You have bazel 0.9.0 installed.
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /home/fong/anaconda3/bin/python]:
Found possible Python library paths:
/home/fong/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/home/fong/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages]

jemalloc as malloc support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [Y/n]: y
Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [Y/n]: y
Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Amazon S3 File System support? [Y/n]: y
Amazon S3 File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]: y

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]:
Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the environment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.
