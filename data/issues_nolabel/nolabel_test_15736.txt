Importing submodules from tensorflow.keras fails with No module named 'tensorflow.keras'

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-19-ga52c8d9 1.4.1
Python version: 3.6
Exact command to reproduce:
from tensorflow.keras import datasets # fails but should work
import tensorflow as tf #succeeds
tf.keras.datasets #succeeds
from tensorflow.python.keras import datasetst # succeeds

Describe the problem
Importing submodules from tensorflow.keras fails with error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.keras'. but import tensorflow as tf and then doing tf.keras.datasets works. This is a big inconsistency, also it means that every time an element from within the tensforlow.keras module you need to write the complete path (which is very annoying) this removes the simplicity and readability of the keras API. A work around is to import submodules from tensorflow.python.keras, which again is inconsistent.
In my opinion, since the documentation states that keras is availabe at tf.keras that should be the access path to the submodules and not tensorflow.python.keras. I'll try to  make a pull request for this.
