Not finding cuda library for jobs that do NOT require GPU

I am having this error when I use the slurm (http://slurm.schedmd.com/) workload manager. When I run some tensorflow python scripts, sometimes it results in an error (attached). It seems that it can't find cuda library installed but I am running scripts that do not require GPUs.  Therefore, I find it very confusing why cuda would be an issue at all. Why is cuda installation an issue if I don't need it?

Operating System:   CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN (calling ls -l /usr/lib/libcuda.so.352.63):
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14272428 Dec 15  2015 /usr/lib/libcuda.so.352.63
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
tensorflow (0.9.0)

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". running this seems to produce different results from the error I expected. what it outputs:

Steps to reproduce

run the sbatch command in slurm and dispatch about 1000 jobs running an idential tensorflow script. Returns that error.

What have you tried?

I've tried logging into the node directly throwing the error and run tensorflow jobs but it seems when I do that there are no errors.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
