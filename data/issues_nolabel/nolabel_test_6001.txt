How to enable the support of cuda compute capability 3.0 GPU in windows

I just setup gpu supported tensorflow on my windows 10 PC following https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/tensorflow-0-12-adds-support-for-windows.html
But right now I found I cannot use my GPU as it is a GeForece GTX760 and only has 3.0 CUDA compute capability
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
There are several discussion for linux and MAC tensorflow, as they can build from source so they can just change the list of the computer capability. right now I cannot build from source so I am wondering if there are any other way to change the setup?
Environment info

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
