[WIP] [tf.learn] API restructure

API restructure to unify pieces and support a wider variety of models (such as multi head, unsupervised, etc)
Done:

Estimator now uses (features, targets, mode) -> (prediction, loss, train_op). Moved optimize_loss into TensorFlowEstimator (it's now a "simple" Estimator).
Removed classification flag from Estimator.

Todo:

Integrate BaseEstimator and Estimator.
Add Classifier and Regressor subclasses.
Make sure TensorFlowEstimator supports multi-feature.
Integrate TensorFlowDNN/Linear with DNN/Linear Classifiers and Regressors.
