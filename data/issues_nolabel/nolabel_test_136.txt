ResourceExhaustedError in CNN/MNIST example (with GPU)

(I'm using GPU(GTX 980) with CUDA-7.0&cuDNNv2, on Ubuntu 14.04)
I have gone through MNIST tutorial: http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.md
Everything was going well except for the last two lines:
print "test accuracy %g"%accuracy.eval(feed_dict={
    x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels, keep_prob: 1.0})
Executing these lines, I got an error:
ResourceExhaustedError: OOM when allocating tensor with shapedim { size: 10000 } dim { size: 18 } dim { size: 18 } dim { size: 32 }
I think basic reason for this error is that test data can not be allocated to GPU device.
Is this a bug or not? Are there good way to avoid this issue?
