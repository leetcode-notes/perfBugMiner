failed call to cuInit: CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN in python programs using Ubuntu bumblebee

I have a Quadro K1100M integrated gpu with compute capability 3.0. I had to install bumblebee to make CUDA work. I am now able to run the tutorials_example_trainer with the command sudo optirun bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu. I have been able to do that with TF_UNOFFICIAL_SETTING=1 ./configure. However, I am not able to run examples in python directly.
For example, if I run the convolutional.py in tensorflow/models/image/mnist with the command optirun python convolutional.py, I get the following error :
tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/mnist$ optirun python convolutional.py

It is like my gpu is not recognized in python programs because of the 3.0 compute capability.  Is there a way to avoid this problem?
