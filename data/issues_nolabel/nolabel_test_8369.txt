Add argument axis in tf.TensorArray method concat()?

Hi, TF development team,
Would it possible to add an argument axis in tf.TensorArray method concat(), defined in file tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/tensor_array_ops.py?
The reason is that there could be use cases when concat on the last axis make sense. Of course, the requirement would also need to be changed to
"""
All of the values must have been written, their ranks must match, and
and their shapes must all match for all dimensions except the dimension specified as axis.
"""
BTW, or, would tf.concat() accept tf.TensorArray as input? - I tried, but didn't find a way.
Thanks.
