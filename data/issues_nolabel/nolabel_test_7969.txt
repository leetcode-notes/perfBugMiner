Bottom-right precedence of padding?

Why has Tensorflow chosen to prefer padding on the bottom right?
With 'SAME' padding, to me it would feel logical to start the kernel's center anchor at the first real pixel. Due to the use of asymmetric padding, this results in a discrepancy with some other frameworks. I do understand that asymmetric padding in principle is good because otherwise one would be left with an unused padding row/column.
