feature request - tf.stack

Given a tensor x[i,j,k] in a graph, I often want to construct tensors like X[i,j,k,p,q] = x[i,j,k].
You can get this done using tf.pack, but it can get kind of messy if you are adding a bunch of dimensions.
It would be nice if there was a function tf.stack(x,list) which added dimensions to a tensor as above. The name is motivated by the following situation. If x is a matrix, then tf.stack(x,[n]) would create a 3-tensor by stacking the matrix up n times. I imagine that tf.stack would fit nicely under tf.tile in the documentation
It is possible that there is already a better way to do this than using tf.pack, but if so, it is not in the docs.
