Documentation of ctc_beam_search_decoder is inconsistent

The documentation of ctc_beam_search_decoder describes the input argument as:
inputs: 3-D `float` `Tensor`, size
    `[max_time x batch_size x num_classes]`.  The logits.

Implying that they should be the linear projections. However, by inspecting the unit tests and the implementation, it seems these inputs should actually be log-probabilities. In this case, the documentation should read:
inputs: 3-D `float` `Tensor`, size
  `[max_time x batch_size x num_classes]`.
The output symbol log-probabilities.
