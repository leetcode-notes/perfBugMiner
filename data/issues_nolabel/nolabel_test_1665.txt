Added implementation for GridRNN

As discussed here: #1453
The implementation is generic, users can specify the number of dimensions and various configurations for those dimensions (input/output/priority/non-recurrent). The type of the cells along dimensions can also be selected among LSTM, GRU, vanilla RNN.
Come with unittests for basic types: 2LSTM (tied weights, non-recurrent), 2BasicLSTM and 2RNN.
I made a simple test of Grid2LSTM for character-level language modeling: https://github.com/phvu/grid-lstm-tensorflow/tree/master/char-rnn.
