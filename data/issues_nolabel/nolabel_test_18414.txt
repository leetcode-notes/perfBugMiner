Updating highwayhash library to fix kernel_tests:lookup_ops_test, lookup:lookup_ops_test and string_to_hash_bucket_op_test tests on ppc

All three of these tests were failing on ppc64le ,because the build was using a version of the highwayhash library which did not properly support the power architecture. Updating the library to include commit e2098b (google/highwayhash@e2098bc) seems to fix the issue.
Thanks !
