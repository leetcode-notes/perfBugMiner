Request for spatial softmax implementation

Spatial softmax is defined in End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies. This is a request for an implementation in the TensorFlow API, or if the dimension flag for the regular softmax does this, could the term and an example be explicitly added to the g3doc?
It seems this may already be implemented with tf but not yet incorporated upstream according to Collective Robot Reinforcement Learning with Distributed Asynchronous Guided Policy Search:

This entire system, which we call asynchronous distributed
guided policy search (ADGPS), was implemented in the
distributed machine learning framework TensorFlow [...snip...]
Our architecture resembles prior work, with the visual features
represented by feature points produced via a spatial softmax
applied to the last convolutional
response maps.
