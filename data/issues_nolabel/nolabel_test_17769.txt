SSD Resnet50 FPN ValueError: Dimensions must be equal

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): custom .config file, see below
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7-rc0 and also tried on 1.6
Python version: Tried 2.7 and 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9) 5.4.0 20160609
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 6.0
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
Exact command to reproduce:

python3 object_detection/train.py \
    --pipeline_config_path=object_detection/samples/ssd_resnet_50_fpn_drone.config \
    --train_dir=object_detection/drone \
    --num_clones=1

When I'm trying to run test FPN config from model_builder_test.py (see attach), I'm getting error:
WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/base.py:198: retry (from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.base) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use the retry module or similar alternatives.

model_builder_test.py and ssd_resnet_v1_fpn_feature_extractor_test.py passes on Python2.7.
Tried TF 1.6 and 1.7, Python 2.7 and 3.5, tried different input resolutions. All the same. Seems like a bug.
