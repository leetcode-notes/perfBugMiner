Describe the problem
I have beed trained a image classification cnn model with the Estimator and Dataset(tf.data.TFRecordsDataset) API. The relative model files have bee saved in model_dir. The last few days I try very hard to figure out how to predict one or more images label using the saved model files.
However I failed and don't know what to do. I can't find relative contents in the official doc. So adding an easy method to do this may be a good idea. Or is there another solution I missed?
FYI, my training code is here.
