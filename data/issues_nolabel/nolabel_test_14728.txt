Edit mnist data read in to match tutorial

The accompanying tutorial (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners) and this file did not match. The proposed code change was copied from the tutorial and confirmed to run correctly.
Note that this removes the ability to pass a custom data directory as an argument. However, since this is aimed at absolute beginners I believe clarity is more important than flexibility.
