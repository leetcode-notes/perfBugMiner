[TensorFlow.org] Anchor Tag Incorrect Reference

Nothing really serious but I noticed the link on see Pip installation for Windows on getting started doc body is using an anchor separated with dashes #pip-installation-on-windows  while the corresponding id uses underscores #pip_installation_on_windows.
For instance, the body anchor (which works on github)
#pip-installation-on-windows
and the right side nav-bar Index link, working normally, with underscores
#pip_installation_on_windows
I was going to submit a PR but changing to the latter breaks on github.
