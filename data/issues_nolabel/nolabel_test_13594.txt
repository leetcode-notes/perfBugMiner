How to display Runtime Statistics in Tensorboard using Estimator API in a distributed environment

Hello,
I am running in the the same issue than described in this stack overflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45719176/how-to-display-runtime-statistics-in-tensorboard-using-estimator-api-in-a-distri..
I know that GitHub is used for features requests and bugs but this question didn't get an answer and I am not the only one running in the problem.
This is how the doc illustrates how to add  and save Runtime statistics:
run_options = tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()
summary, _ = sess.run([merged, train_step],
                                       feed_dict=feed_dict(True),
                                       options=run_options,
                                       run_metadata=run_metadata)
train_writer.add_run_metadata(run_metadata, 'step%d' % i)
 train_writer.add_summary(summary, i)

Given that there is no evident way to call sess.run in the training phase with the Estimator API, I am genuinely wondering how to write this kind of summary... is there a workaround?
I was thinking about using a SessionRunHook to create something to pass to the EstimatorSpec but I am really not familiar with that..
