bus error (core dumped), when build with GPU support

I followed the installing from source tutorial, however in step
bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu

I encountered the following message:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so locally
[1]    5462 bus error (core dumped)  bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu

Any helps would be great
