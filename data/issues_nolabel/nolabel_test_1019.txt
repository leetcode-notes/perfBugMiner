Tensorflow Android not building for non-arm architectures.

I am trying to build the Tensorflow Android Camera Demo for x86 (or x86_64, or mips) architecture but bazel seems to be ignoring the --android_cpu flag and always builds for armeabi-v7a.
I have also tried using the --fat_apk_cpu flag but I am getting compilation error about the: unrecognized command line option -mfpu=neon.
