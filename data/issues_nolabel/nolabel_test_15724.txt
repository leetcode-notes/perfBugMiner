How to register all kernels to Android lib

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.0.1
Python version: 3.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I am trying to compile a Android lib which can load a MetaGraph into a session as this link specifies. I first extracts a GraphDef from this MetaGraph and uses this GraphDef to generate ops_to_register.h. Then I compile the lib as
bazel build my_model/test:test_lib --copt=-DSELECTIVE_REGISTRATION --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain --cpu=armeabi-v7a
However when I trying to run the test_lib, it complains some kernels are not registered. Then I brutally adds all kernels to be registered as
#define SHOULD_REGISTER_OP_KERNEL(clz) true
However, it still complains
Error creating graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Const' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
  <no registered kernels>

	 [[Node: save/RestoreV2_8/shape_and_slices = Const[_output_shapes=[[1]], dtype=DT_STRING, value=Tensor<type: string shape: [1] values: >]()]]

How can I solve this by adding this Const kernel or simply registering all kernels?
