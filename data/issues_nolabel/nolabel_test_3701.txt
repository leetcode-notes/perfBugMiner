tensorflow won't release system memroy

Hi all,
I started to use tensorflow one month ago. I briefly use it to train neural machine translation models.
I find that after several times of training,  there were a huge amount of memory not released. I have to reboot my machine after some numbers of training to release those memory.
I use the sample code( tensorflow/models/rnn/translate python translate.py) to train the model.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
tensorflow version: r.0.10
CUDA version: libcudnn.so.4.0
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
What have you tried?



Add a maximum step number to terminate training normally.


replace
with tf.Session() as sess:


with the following code:
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth=True
sess = tf.Session(config=config)
with tf.Graph().as_default(),sess:

close the session after training
sess.close()
del sess
the version of my nvidia driver is 352.79 now.
I will update it to the latest version next week.

I have no idea what to do now.
Thanks!
Best,
