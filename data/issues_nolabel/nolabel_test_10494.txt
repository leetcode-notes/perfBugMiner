incorrect documentation in _SliceHelper

The outputs shown for several of the examples in the _SliceHelper docstring are incorrect (based on some previous examples?).
See, for example, this line: 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py
    
    
         Line 412
      in
      359d6f9
    
    
    
    

        
          
             print(foo[tf.newaxis].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]]
