[feature request] add higher order function `scanr`

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: OSX 10.11.6
TensorFlow installed from: conda-forge
TensorFlow version: 1.5
Bazel version: N.A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A (CPU only)
GPU model and memory (CPU only)
Exact command to reproduce: N/A
Description:
TensorFlow has foldl which folds the array from first to last, and foldr which folds the array from last to first. It also has scan which returns the trace of foldl, but there is no scanr that returns the trace of foldr.
scanr can be proven useful sometimes. Look at the following snippet that is sampled from my implementation of a crf lstm sequence tagger.
reverse_path = tf.scan(step_path, tf.reverse(backpointers, axis=[0]), initializer=best_tag_id, back_prop=False)
best_path = tf.concat([tf.reverse(reverse_path, axis=[0])[1:], [best_tag_id]], axis=0)
I have to call tf.reverse twice, just because TensorFlow only provides scan from first to last.
