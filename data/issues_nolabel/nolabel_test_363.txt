No Rollback after "cifar10_train.py" canceled

Hi,
I noticed than on both Ubuntu and Mac OSX there is no handling of cancelling (rollback?) the cifar10-set download process of the cifar10_train.py via ctrl+c.
If the process was once canceled you will be incapable of running the script again. The following error will be issued:
Traceback (most recent call last):
