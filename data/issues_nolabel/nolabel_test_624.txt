Android Tensorflow demo crash

I tried the tensorflow demo for android and it looks really promising, but there is a big problem, every time I completely cover the camera my cellphone will horribly crash and reboot, which has never happened to me, I have never encountered an error in an application that will reboot my phone completely, so in order to take this into production I have to find the reason for this, and try to fix it, I hope someone here can provide some guidance or feedback as to why this is happening, it might be that the app is working too hard, but still it would be weird for the whole phone to crash, the scenario is like this, the app is working fine and then when I cover the camera with my finger it will recognize a nematode and immediately crash, any comments would be appreciated, I wonder if anybody else has run into this issue, my cellphone is a samsung galaxy s6 by the way.
