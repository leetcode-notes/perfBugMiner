"ImportError: No module named protobuf" on El Capitan with VirtualEnv

Hello,
When I try importing tensorflow in Python I get "ImportError: No module named protobuf".
I followed instructions from here https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/0.6.0/get_started/os_setup.html#virtualenv_install and also updated protobuf:
brew reinstall --devel protobuf
The version I have is 3.0.0a3
I looked at the issues here and all remedies don't seem to work.
Any clue?
Thx
