Documentation request: NN regression

There is a disconnect between the CSV documentation and the regression docs. I've documented one example here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40093776/csv-tensorflow-regression-via-neural-network-model
I would like to request clearer examples of feeding neural networks with CSV or NDArrays. Most of the NN examples I've seen were strictly classification. They do not show how to take Numpy NDarrays (features x instances or class column) or CSV to predict a regression column.
The documentation I found on these pages below was confusing or vague. Overall, there are major gaps for doing the task above. The proposed documentation would clearly demonstrate with complete code using any of these: DNNRegressor, TensorFlowDNNRegressor, LinearRegressor, TensorFlowLinearRegressor, TensorFlowRNNRegressor, TensorFlowRegressor. If such documentation exists and I have yet to discover it, please advise me. Thanks.
