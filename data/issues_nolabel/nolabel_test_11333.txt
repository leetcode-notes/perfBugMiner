ValueError: Variable vgg_16/conv1/conv1_1/weights already exists, disallowed

I got this kind of error message when trying use existing weight.
ValueError: Variable vgg_16/conv1/conv1_1/weights already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope? Originally defined at:

  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/variables.py", line 217, in variable
    use_resource=use_resource)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/arg_scope.py", line 181, in func_with_args
    return func(*args, **current_args)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/variables.py", line 262, in model_variable
    use_resource=use_resource)

Please advice. Thank you.
