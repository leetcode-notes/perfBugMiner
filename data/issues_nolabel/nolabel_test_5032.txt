AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'batch_fft'

Hi,
I just reinstalled rebuilt tensorflow from source to use CUDA v8 (I changed GPU to gtx1070)
I was running tf.batch_fft perfectly fine previously. But now it returns
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'batch_fft'
Can someone point me to where this batch_fft is implemented now? I am using version 0.11.0rc0 now.
I can't remember if I was using 0.10 previously or not. Did the API change?
Thanks in advance! :)
