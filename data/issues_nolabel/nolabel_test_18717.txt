iOS: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Conv2d' with these attrs

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
YES


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mac OS 10.12.6 (16G29)


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
I only build the iOS library from source
when I trained the model, I install it use pip


TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.7.0


Python version:


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version:
Not use GPU


GPU model and memory:


Exact command to reproduce:
build_all_ios.sh -g mymodel.pb


Describe the problem
I use command list below to generate the ops_to_register.h file. and build the iOS library use "build_all_ios.sh -g mymodel.pb"
$ bazel build tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header
$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header \
  --graphs=graph.pb > tensorflow/core/framework/ops_to_register.h

After that , I config my Xcode and run the model on an iphone, but it issues error:
Could not create TensorFlow Graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Conv2D' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:

 [[Node: init_conv/Conv2D = Conv2D[T=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NHWC", dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID", strides=[1, 4, 4, 1], use_cudnn_on_gpu=false](Pad, init_conv/weights/read)]]

but the conv*.cc is in the tf_op_files.txt,  Is there some error on my usage?
