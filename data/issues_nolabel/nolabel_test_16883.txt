Feauture Request: Multidimensional RNN

I would like to contribute a Multidimensional RNN feature in the contrib directory based on the implementation mentioned here.

Right now it's possible to implement various types of multidimensional RNNs by feeding in your data as time being one direction (say, x), taking the output of the RNN, transposing it, and feeding it into a second RNN. etc. Alternatively feed your data & its transpose into separate RNNs (possibly with tied weights) and depth-concatenate the results. And maybe feed the result into another RNN.

By any chance, is it related to the main paper for it?
