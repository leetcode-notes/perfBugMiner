Modified mnist.py to use random seeds.

Modified mnist.py to use random seeds to allow for repeatable behavior during development and testing.  This may be especially helpful in the MNIST tutorials.  Both graph level seeds via the tf.set_random_seed call like:  tf.set_random_seed(1238)
and op level via something like:
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(FLAGS.data_dir, one_hot=True, seed=12345)
are allowed, to be consistent with the overall Tensorflow random seed handling.
