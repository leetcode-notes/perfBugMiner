Bazel target to create C++ library headers

Thanks to the //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so target, I can now build a shared library that I can use in my C++ programs.  I want to install that library in /usr/local/lib and put the headers for it in /usr/local/include, but there is no target to build and install those headers.  In particular, building the library doesn't build the headers from the proto files, so I have error_codes.proto, but not error_codes.pb.h, so I can't even use the source directory for the headers.
