Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Hi. I'm following this tutorial for image classification: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#4 but with my own image dataset. I let the retraining run overnight, and it successfully completed. Now I am trying to visualize the results with Tensorboard.
I ran tensorboard and this is the only terminal output:
	:/tf_files# tensorboard --logdir training_summaries --debug
	Starting TensorBoard 47 at http://0.0.0.0:6006
	(Press CTRL+C to quit)

When I visit http://0.0.0.0:6006 the page does not load and it says 'Site cannot be reached.'
My retraining command was:
python retrain.py \
  --bottleneck_dir=bottlenecks \
  --model_dir=inception \
  --summaries_dir=training_summaries/long \
  --output_graph=retrained_graph.pb \
  --output_labels=retrained_labels.txt \
  --image_dir=data

Can anyone help? I'm new to TF so I appreciate the advice.
