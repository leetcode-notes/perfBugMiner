SyncReplicasOptimizer hangs

I'm using SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 with a shared queue that closes at the end of an epoch. The workers catch the OutOfRange exception and one of them resets the session. (I think that's the expected workflow).
I think the workers sometimes get stuck in the sync op, maybe if they are waiting on other workers that started after the queue ran out. Is this an expected behavior, and if so what is the recommended way to prevent this?
