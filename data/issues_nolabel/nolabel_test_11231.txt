[solved, solution is on the bottom] link libtensorflow-core.a to c++ cross comple project

Hi ~ all~
i followed:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/README.md
and successfully got ios, android, linux lib files in contrib\makefile\gen\lib.
i'm developing a cross platform sdk lib which is written by c++.  my plan is using my sdk c++ code to call tensorflow lib.
here is my question: where are the h files according to the tensorflow lib file ?
commenly, a lib project's out put is not only a binary file , but also h files .
