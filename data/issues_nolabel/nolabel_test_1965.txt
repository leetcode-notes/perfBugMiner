AttributeError: NewBase is_abstract, ImportError: libcudart.so.7.5

Hi,
I have tried to install tensorflow as in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html
I have cuda 7.0 installed under /usr/local/cuda
After I install gpu version using pip it gives the error-  ImportError: libcudart.so.7.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
But I have  libcudart.so.7.0 file. Why this is referring 7.5 by default ?
(issues for version 0.7 and 0.8)
Then I tried to install cpu only version and giving me the error
AttributeError: type object 'NewBase' has no attribute 'is_abstract' (only to version 0.8)
How can I solve those issues ?
Thanks
