Problems with Tensorboard on Ubuntu 16.04

I'm running code from https://github.com/MorvanZhou/tutorials/blob/master/tensorflowTUT/tf15_tensorboard/full_code.py on my own computer, which is a sample of how to use Tensorboard, however, I see nothing from the Tensor board from my computer: every tab of the Tensorflow is empty, saying no XX data is found.
I tried the '--inspect option':

zhao@zhao-ubuntu:~/Desktop/samples$ tensorboard --logdir = 'logs' --inspect ====================================================================== Processing event files... (this can take a few minutes) ======================================================================
No event files found within logdir =

and the '--debug' option:

zhao@zhao-ubuntu:~/Desktop/samples$ tensorboard --logdir = 'logs' --debug INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is in debug mode. INFO:tensorflow:Starting TensorBoard in directory /home/zhao/Desktop/samples
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard path_to_run is: {'/home/zhao/Desktop/samples/=': None}
INFO:tensorflow:Multiplexer done loading. Load took 0.0 secs INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is tag:b'22'
Starting TensorBoard b'22' on port 6006 (You can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:6006)

BTW, I'm using python3.5.1 on my ubuntu machine.
