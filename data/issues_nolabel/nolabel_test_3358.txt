IOS - No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Add' with these attrs

Hi everyone,
We are trying to load a very simple graph inside IOS
Right now, we have this following error:
Running model failed: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Add' with these attrs
     [[Node: deconv2d_1_1/add_3 = Add[T=DT_INT32](deconv2d_1_1/Squeeze_2, deconv2d_1_1/add_3/y)]]
