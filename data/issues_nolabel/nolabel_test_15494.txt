Enables 0-D indexing for Gather() in TFLite

Hi,
This patch enables use of scalar (0-D) index for Gather() in TFLite.
Since Dims<> still works correctly (which becomes {1, 1, 1, 1}) when calculating a scalar tensor,
no actual internal change is needed. Still, it only supports indexing the first dimension.
At here, int32 is changed to int32_t because my clang on OSX 10.12 complains that int32 is undefined.
