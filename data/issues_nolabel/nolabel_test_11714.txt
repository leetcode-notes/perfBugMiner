Describe the problem
I am building a docker container, compiling tensorflow from source, would like to use MKL, and need to run configure script silently in order to set up the build correctly. Cannot figure out where, when and how the MKL libraries are being installed.
Source code / logs
none
Is there a way to run the configure script silently? alternatively,
Does someone have a Docker script that will compile tensorflow USING the MKL?
