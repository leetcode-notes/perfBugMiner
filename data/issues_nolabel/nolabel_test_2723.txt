Enable whole batch whitening.

The function tf.image.per_image_whitening() can now be applied to a whole batch. Mean and adjusted_stddev is then computed over all batch dimensions.
I find it very useful to be able to ably tf.image.whitening to an entire batch.

In some situations a batch is given (due to previous computation in the graph). Splitting the batch into individual images, in order to be able to apply whitening seams to be a bit redundant.
Applying whitening to a batch is statistically superior (and more elegant when used in combination with Batch Normalization).

It might be considered to rename the function in per_batch_whitening. As this would now be more accurate.
