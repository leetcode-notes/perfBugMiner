Exact command to reproduce:

I have a bug where a frozen model will not load in an android app. The code is at
https://github.com/cooledge/Chatbot
In ChatActivity on line 39 I load an model that is trivial and built by running "cd nn; python ./train_noop.py --epochs 5 --save_words --freeze". That loads thus showing the Android app is setup correctly for loading models. On line 40 I load a model that I got from your tensorflow demo. That also loads showing that complex models can be loaded. On line 41 I load the model that I actually want to load and that fails with the error invalid GraphDef. That model is build by running 'cd nn; python ./train.py --epochs 5 --save_words --freeze". Why is that not loading. It loads under python on ubuntu and can generate samples. The bug is repoducable by running the app after syncing you don't need to run the training.
