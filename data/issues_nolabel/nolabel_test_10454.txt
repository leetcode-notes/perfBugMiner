I have SavedModel using TensorForestEstimator (RandomForest) by using export_savedmodel() it was saved successfully and able to load from SavedModel-cli too. But when trying to load using
val SAVED_MODEL_PATH =
      "/Users/Documents/tensordata/1496652787";
    val bundle = SavedModelBundle.load(SAVED_MODEL_PATH, "serve");

It's giving following error -:
Exception in thread "main" org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'TreePredictions'
	at org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle.load(Native Method)
	at org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle.load(SavedModelBundle.java:38)
	at ai.tenten.ml.ClassifyITCase$.main(ClassifyITCase.scala:59)

I am able to load Other saved models like HalfPlusTwo Regression and mnist dense Predict model successfully. Only in RandomForest It's giving error I thing some op is missing from build or Java API is not updated.
