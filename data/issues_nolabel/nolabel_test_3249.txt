Change cudnn version checking to check Major version.

CuDNN versions with the same major version should be ABI
compatible, which means that if we release a binary
with cudnn version 5.1, it should be compatible with
a system whose runtime loads version 5.0.  This check
would trigger if the cudnn version loaded at runtime is
5 but the compile-time version used was 4.
This change is based off of recommendations from
#2525 (comment).
Fixes #3225.
