how to parse training examples with 2 dimension in csv file with tf.decode_csv

I used tf.decode_csv in tensorflow as decoder to parse training examples in a tab-delimited file into cnn models. For every training example, the features are 2 dimensions (100 columns, 2000 rows). After reading the document in tensorflow official site, I still have two questions.

how to create record_defaults for my case (2 dimensional data) and how to stack the features of 2 dimensionality? The following is my code to do that, but it gave me errors.

filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer([file], num_epochs)
key, value = tf.TextLineReader().read(filename_queue)
record_defaults = [[1.0] for col in range(0, 100)]
content = tf.decode_csv(value, record_defaults = record_defaults, field_delim = '\t')
features = tf.stack(content[0:100])

I am doing binary (0, 1) classification. Where do I put the labels for training examples? in the 2001th row? (For every training example, the first 2000 rows for features, and the 2001th row for label)

Thanks for your time!
