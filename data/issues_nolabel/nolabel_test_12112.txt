Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
The Problem is that slim does not seem to contain the directory nets (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets) anymore even though in the repo it's still there.
It's also still in the slim docs (#12112).
