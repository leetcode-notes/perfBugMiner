Java API - sophisticated example

Dear All,
I have seen the example for importing model created and trained in Python imported into Java code and used for predictions.  However, I had some problems understanding what was actually going on especially in this block and this block. Would it be possible to get some more documentation on it?
Moreover, I know the Java API is still under construction. However, I would be interested in if it is possible to see some more sophisticated examples, if it is possible including:


importing model into Java and then performing training on the model


implementing, training, evaluating, saving, loading a model from scratch in Java


Thank you for any help!
Cheers,
Peter
