Feature Request for BitwiseXOR for Tensor

My project requests a new layer, which needs the new operator of Tensor to compute bitwiseXOR between input x and constant Key k.
E.g. x = 4 (bit form: 100), k = 7 (111), the bitwiseXOR(x, k) expects as 3 (011).
As far as I know, Tensor only has LogicXOR operator for bool type. Luckily, Tensorflow has the extended ability to have a new Op. However, I read the document in https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op, I can get the basic idea, but that is far from the implementation, maybe because of the lack of c++ knowledge. If you guys could help to implement the new operator that will be helpful. Then I can use that new Op of Tensor to build the new layers.
