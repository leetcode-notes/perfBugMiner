Cholesky backpropagation

This implements a gradient op for the Cholesky op as requested and discussed in #367 .
The code was written by myself and Dr. James Henman (user name @jameshensman ).
The implementation is a blocked cholesky backpropagation as advocated by Dr. Iain Murray in this recent paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07527
New unit tests are included.
A lot of work has gone into the implementation of the algorithm and I therefore believe the code has value to the community. Less work so far has gone in to tightly integrating it with TensorFlow code base and I am looking for help and advice from the TensorFlow team. As such it should be regarded as a work in progress.  @martinwicke suggested the best path forward was to submit this pull request.
