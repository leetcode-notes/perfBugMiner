How does wide_n_deep model support install app columns?

wide_n_deep model in paper [1] support embedding for users' installed app features.
But in wide_n_deep.py and feature_column.py, I haven't find something about supporting embedding for users' installed app features, which trains embedding jointly for multi-columns.
Do I miss anything? or misunderstanding
