tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter() results in "UnknownError: Failed to create a NewWriteableFile"

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7, 64 Bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): TensorFlow installed from Conda

Exact command to reproduce:
import tensorflow as tf
tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter('C:\Users\user_name\Documents')

import tensorflow as tf
tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter('Any_path')
Problem
tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter('path') doesn't create output file and returns following error:
UnknownError: Failed to create a NewWriteableFile: 'path' : Access is denied.
; Input/output error.
Troubleshooting
Tried with different folders and drives as "path". But error is consistent
