Validating Tensorflow On OS X (Sierra 10.12.3)

Using python 2.7. Created virtualenv
Installed tensorflow on virtualenv as per instruction
Went to validation steps and below is the output:



import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('hello, tensorflow!')
sess = tf.Session()
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use FMA instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
print (sess.run(hello))
hello, tensorflow!



Any idea what I have done wrong? The message does not appear to be a show stopper rather an unhelpful warning message. Will crack on with my R+D but would appreciate knowing what I can do to fix this!
Cheers,
