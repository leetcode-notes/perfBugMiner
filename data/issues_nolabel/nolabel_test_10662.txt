TF_BINARY_URL

Would be so grateful for some guidance.
Please advise on the appropriate TF_BINARY_URL for compiling Tensor Flow on an Odroid XU4 which uses a Samsung Exynos5422 Cortex™-A15 2Ghz and Cortex™-A7 Octa core CPUs and a Mali-T628 MP6(OpenGL ES 3.1/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.2 Full profile).
Please advise on the TF_BINARY_URL to use for:
Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, CPU only, Python 2.7
Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, CPU only, Python 3.5
Is there a GPU version that supports the Mali-T628 MP6(OpenGL ES 3.1/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.2 Full profile) on the Odroid XU4
Thank you!
