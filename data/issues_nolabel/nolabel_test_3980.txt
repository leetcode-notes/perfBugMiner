CUDA autoconf improvements

Some improvements to the new CUDA autoconf mechanism from the discussion in #3269 and #3966:

Autodetect nvcc version and:

Set CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH based on detected version
Set --expt-relaxed-constexpr iff detected version is >= 7.5.


Set cxx_builtin_include_directory for CUDA headers based on detected include directories, similar to _get_cxx_inc_directories
Move remaining checks in configure script into cuda_configure so that the configure script only contains the user interface.
