getting the dynamic shape of a Tensor as an integer

How can I get xshape as a int variable? Is this feature available?
Of course if I evaluate, I will get the value of xshape, but the input is dynamic and I don't want to use the get_sum function in for loop, because it would break the graph.
Problem: TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got Tensor
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None])
xshape = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[])


def get_sum(x, xshape):
  sum = 0
  for i in range(xshape):
    sum += x[i]

init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sum = get_sum(x, xshape)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(init)
  for i in range(100):
    length = np.random.randint(0,10)
    a = np.random.randint(0, 10, length)
  print sess.run(sum,feed_dict={x:a, xshape:length})
