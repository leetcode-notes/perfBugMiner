Problem
I wrote a Text CNN in eager model:
class TextCnn(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        ......
        self.conv_funcs = [tf.layers.Conv2D(filter_num,
                                            [filter_size, embedding_size],
                                            activation=tf.nn.relu,
                                            name='conv_{}'.format(filter_size))
                           for filter_size, filter_num in filter_size_num_list]

I set the list of Conv2D layers as an instance property(self.conv_funcs), and when I restore the model by tfe.Checkpoint, the weights of the Conv2D layers are not restored.
However, I add the following code and the tfe.Checkpoint successfully restore the weights of the Conv2D layers:
        self.conv_2 = self.conv_funcs[0]
        self.conv_3 = self.conv_funcs[1] 
Is it a bug that tfe.Checkpoint only restore the weights of instance properties of tf.keras.Model?
