DBpedia datasets not available. 404.

Trying to run the code in /learn/text_classification returns a 404 when trying to download the DBpedia dataset.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/learn/text_classification.py
The constant "DBPEDIA_URL" in .../learn/python/learn/datasets/text_datasets.py seems to be wrong as it returns a 404 in Chrome as well.
This is the URL in text_datasets.py:

Which returns a 404.
