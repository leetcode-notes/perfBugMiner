Tensorflow server doesn't pick version updates if pointed to shared model_config.conf file

I'm currently deploying tensorflow models on multiple servers in production but seem to have a issue while there is a model config file update.
Issue is -
On updating the model config file located at a common shared location that all then tensorflow servers point to, not all the servers pick up the version updates!
On the contrary, the issue seems to be not occuring when each of the tensorflow server has its own model_config file, then it simultaneously updates with new versions.
This is a unwanted behavior, wanted to know if there is a work around or is it a bug which is existent in tensorflow serving.
model_config looks something similar to this -
model_config_list: {
  config: {
    name: "modelName1",
    base_path: "/path to model1 files/",
    model_platform: "tensorflow"
  },
    config: {
    name: "modelName2",
    base_path: "/path to model2 files/",
    model_platform: "tensorflow"
  }
}
