Improve shape inference with `DecodeAndCropJpeg`

While working on improving shape inference for several other ops in #13561 and #13193, I noticed that DecodeAndCropJpeg does not inference shape even though crop size might have already be provided. In that case the shape will be [h, w, channel] and h, w is part of the crop_window in input.
This fix updates the shape function in DecodeAndCropJpeg for improving shape inference.
The test has also been updated to cover the changes.
