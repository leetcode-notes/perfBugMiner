Mistake in matrix multiplication(http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.md)

When single layer network math is described you have following:
"""If we write that out as equations, we get:"""
after that comes picture with weight multiplications, but there should be
W_1,1_x_1 + W_1,2_x_2 + W_1,3_x_3 + b_1
etc..
Instead there written:
W_1,1_x_1 + W_1,2_x_1 + W_1,3_x_1 + b_1
etc..
Please correct me if I am mistaken.
