Feature Request: Modification of lstm2d.horizontal_lstm implementation

I noticed something in the documentation of lstm2d.horizontal_lstm. It says:

Run an LSTM bidirectionally over all the rows of each image.

Kinda looks like a bidirectional_lstm to me. I propose to change the implentation such that it will use bidirectional_lstm within the function replacing this:
with variable_scope.variable_scope("lr"):
  hidden_sequence_lr = lstm1d.ndlstm_base(sequence, num_filters_out // 2)
with variable_scope.variable_scope("rl"):
  hidden_sequence_rl = (lstm1d.ndlstm_base(
      sequence, num_filters_out - num_filters_out // 2, reverse=1))
output_sequence = array_ops.concat([hidden_sequence_lr, hidden_sequence_rl],
                                       2)

With this:
cell_fw = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_filters_out // 2)
cell_bw = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_filters_out // 2)
output_sequence = rnn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn(cell_fw, cell_bw, sequence, time_major=True, 
                                                                                 dtype=sequence.dtype)
