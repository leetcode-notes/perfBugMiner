install from source fails on Mac

The installation of tensorflow from source fails on Mac.
The step it fails on is ./configure. The configure script looks like it has never been written to work on the Mac, even though the install guide suggests running ./configure in the section for Mac installation.
The script contains these lines which is where the failure happens:
if [ -e $CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH/lib64/libcudart.so$TF_CUDA_EXT ]; then
break
fi
echo "Invalid path to CUDA $TF_CUDA_VERSION toolkit. $CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH/lib64/libcudart.so$TF_CUDA_EXT cannot be found"

Of course the Mac doesn't have .so libs, or a lib64 dir. For example, my Cuda installation is at /usr/local/cuda, with /usr/local/cuda/lib/ containing *.dylib files including libcudart.dylib.
