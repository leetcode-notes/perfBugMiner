TensorForest: feature request - multi output label support

Looking at the code for TensorForest, it appears that it only allows: multiclass (including binary) classification or regression (scalar and vector). However, there does not seem to be an obvious way to do a multi output classification setup (in which there are multiple binary tasks that should all be predicted by a single model). Could this feature be implemented, or would you be able to guide in the easiest hack to convert to a multi output setup? Apologies if this should actually go to Stack Overflow, please let me know. Thank you!!
