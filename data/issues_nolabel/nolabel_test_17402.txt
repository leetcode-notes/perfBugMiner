Add missing spaces in multiline strings

Came across a missing space in a ValueError exception, and I run quick grep to find other instances of the same issue in the codebase.
> grep -Przoi ".*[a-z]{2}['\"]\s+['\"][a-z].*" . --include \*.py
It's not a big deal, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to submit a fix. Hope it helps...
