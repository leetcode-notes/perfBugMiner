Symbolic loops (like "scan" in Theano)

I've been wondering if there are plans to add symbolic loops to TensorFlow because I feel like this is a major feature when it comes to variable length sequences. Finite unfolding (with bucketing) seems like a dirty hack to me and since (as far as I understand) TensorFlow is meant for deployment, too, how do you envision using it for seq2seq translation given that you don't know ahead of time how long the generated sequence will be?
Thanks,
Sigurd
