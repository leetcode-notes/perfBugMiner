Add `-Wno-write-strings` to remove the warning in external protobuf compilation

This fix is an effort based on the discussion #10838 (comment)
Currently a big chunk (200+) of the warnings when compiling tensorflow are caused by -Wwrite-strings in external protobuf package:
external/protobuf_archive/python/google/protobuf/pyext/message_factory.cc:78:37: warning: ISO C++ forbids converting a string constant to 'char*' [-Wwrite-strings]
...

As protobuf is external, it makes sense to add the flag of -Wno-write-strings to reduce the number of warnings in the output.
This fix reduces 200+ warnings.
