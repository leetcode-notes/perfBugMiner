TensorBoard shows no histograms or events

Running TensorBoard r0.9 results in graph visualizations as expected but all events and histograms that successfully displayed in r0.8 are not.
Has r0.9 introduced a change to the command line that should be used to launch TensorBoard, or to the code needed to generate events and histograms for TensorBoard to display?
Note that neither new summaries and histograms written with recent runs using r0.9 TensorFlow, nor existing ones written (and displayed) in the past, are displayed. Graphs generated with both releases display as expected.
Environment info
Operating System: OS X 10.11.5
TensorFlow: .9.0rc0
Steps to reproduce
tensorboard --logdir ./tflog --purge_orphaned_data
What have you tried?
Reverting to r0.8, which works as it originally did, displaying all events and histograms present in the tflogdirectory provided as the logdir. Reinstalling r0.9, which reproduces the error. A second attempt at reinstalling r0.8 resulted in a TensorBoard that displays jus the menu (no content) and uses a different style (a serif face).
