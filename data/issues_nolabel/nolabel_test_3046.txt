Please add Cuda compute capability 6.1 for GTX 1080

I am building tensorflow from source, and after running below from the root
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
I get

ERROR: /home/shuaiwang/Downloads/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/BUILD:61:1: error loading package 'tensorflow/core': Encountered error while reading extension file 'protobuf.bzl': no such package '@protobuf//': Error cloning repository: https://github.com/google/protobuf: cannot open git-upload-pack caused by https://github.com/google/protobuf: cannot open git-upload-pack caused by github.com and referenced by '//tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer'.

I guess this is because tensorflow doesn't support compute capability for 6.1, which is the only option for GTX 1080, according to this?
