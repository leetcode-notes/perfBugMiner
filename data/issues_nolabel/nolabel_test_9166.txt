Example Cluster Spec for Distributed YoutTube-8m challenge training

Hi,
Can you please post a  ClusterSpec for distributed training of the models defined in  the YouTube-8m Challenge code?
The code tries to load a cluster spec from TF_CONFIG environment variable. However, I'm not sure what the value for TF_CONFIG should be. I have access to 2 GPUs on one machine and just want to run the model with data-level parallelism.
