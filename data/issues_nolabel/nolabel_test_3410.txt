Histogramme

Hi,
This is not a problem but rather a question about the quantile "histogram". I see that Tensorflow can plot almost everything (W, dW, b, db,...).
But what is in it actually ? Knowing that b is a vector, W is a matrix. I assumed that Tensorflow has calculated the norm (L2 et Frobenius) of these tensors to view their evolution through time, right ?
Of course, a probability density function is more than welcome than just a quantile region to treat multimodal, but then, how we can view large multidimensional variables in just a unique graphic ?
Many thanks,
Hoa
