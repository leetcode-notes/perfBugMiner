Crash on retraining flowers

I am following the tutorial How to Retrain Inception's Final Layer for New Categories but am getting this error:
...

Environment info
Operating System: OSX  10.11.1 El Capitan
I've installed from source from this commit ad1d98011ebc.  I ran ./configure with the default answers and followed these build instructions
Steps to reproduce
cd ~
curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
tar xzf flower_photos.tgz
bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain
# Crashes with error above
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir ~/flower_photos

What have you tried?

I've tried deleting /tmp/bottleneck and re-running, but I got the same error.
