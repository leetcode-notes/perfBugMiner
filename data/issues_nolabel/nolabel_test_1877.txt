Word2vec basic show id and word together

When I first read the output, I spent a lot of time to understand these numbers to match them. Now, words along with the ids clearly show what's going on in the sample data and prediction pairs.
[New output]: clearly shows the word ids and corresponding words
Sample data [5239, 3084, 12, 6, 195, 2, 3137, 46, 59, 156] ['anarchism', 'originated', 'as', 'a', 'term', 'of', 'abuse', 'first', 'used', 'against']
3084 originated -> 12 as
3084 originated -> 5239 anarchism
12 as -> 6 a
12 as -> 3084 originated
6 a -> 12 as
6 a -> 195 term
195 term -> 6 a
195 term -> 2 of
[Old output]: No words for Sample data. Word ids and words are mixed, so it's very hard to read
