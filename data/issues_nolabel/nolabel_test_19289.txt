Describe the problem
Running with nightly (both nightly-devel-gpu-py3 and nightly-gpu-py3) is not possible load weights on the keras model.
In the example belowe I have saved the weights, they are saved correctly in the file system and then I have tryed to load them, but I've got an error.
Source code / logs
Here the snippet:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras as ks


def main():
    input_rgb = ks.layers.Input(shape=(1, 5, 5, 3), name="input_rgb")
    x = ks.layers.Dense(1, activation='relu', name="Dense_1")(input_rgb)
    x = ks.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name="sigmoid")(x)
    model = ks.models.Model(inputs=[input_rgb], outputs=[x])
    model.compile(
        loss={'sigmoid': 'binary_crossentropy'},
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam())
    model.save_weights('/tmp/test_weights.h5')

    model.load_weights('/tmp/test_weights.h5', by_name=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

And here the output:
2018-05-15 09:56:21.404382: W tensorflow/core/util/tensor_slice_reader.cc:95] Could not open /tmp/test_weights.h5: Data loss: not an sstable (bad magic number): perhaps your file is in a different file format and you need to use a different restore operator?
