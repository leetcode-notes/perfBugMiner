Use FindOpenMP instead of custom code

As suggested by @fo40225 , this switches from custom code to FindOpenMP. Seems to have been in CMake since at least 3.0. FindOpenMP would be preferred to anything custom. However, this might break the build for anyone still on CMake 2. Is that a supported configuration or something to not worry about?
@gunan This also adds a flag to enable or disable OpenMP. Default is ON but it will warn and disable if not found. This maintains current functionality for existing builds that expect OpenMP but gives the option of disabling.
@fo40225 , I saw you had a couple other ideas about changes to CMake. Were you going to put together a PR with your other changes?
