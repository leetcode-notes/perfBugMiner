What is the possible substitute of cc_ops for android/mobile environment

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64bits
Android Version: 7.1 (Nougat)
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
Development: develop shared library that exposes op's to NDK CPP application.
I am aware, that there is no explicit support for cc_ops on android/mobile env,
I am using few methods in my application.
tensorflow::ops::ReadFile` 
DecodeJpeg
Const(root.WithOpName("size"), {input_height, input_width})

I just copied these headers from //bazel-out to //tensorflow
but it requires dependencies,
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/imgproject/imgproject_model.cc':
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/const_op.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/framework/ops.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/framework/scope.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/array_ops.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/io_ops.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/image_ops.h'
  '/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/math_ops.h

I am not sure whether libtensorflow_inference.so can be used with this
Is there any possible substitute for above op's in android/mobile?
please provide pointers.
