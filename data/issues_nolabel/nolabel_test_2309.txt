Slice all but last element of tensor

I'm trying to slice all but the last element of a tensor, equivalent to python's a[:-1]. However, I understand that tensorflow instead uses a start and size rather than start and end for slicing. My current workaround is to do something like this:
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
# b = [1, 2, 3]
b = tf.reverse(tf.reverse(a, [True])[1:], [True])

This is obviously a bit awkward, and potentially inefficient. Is there a better way to do this?
