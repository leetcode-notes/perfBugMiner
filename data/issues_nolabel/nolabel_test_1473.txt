Tensorflow GPU version support with skflow

I have been trying to execute text_classification.py example of skflow but it is generating an error. Please see the attached document for an error as well as the version of tensorflow and the skflow.
the error is tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'train/update_words/words_embeddings/Assign_1': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '' because the node was colocated with a group of nodes that required incompatible device '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/GPU:0'
