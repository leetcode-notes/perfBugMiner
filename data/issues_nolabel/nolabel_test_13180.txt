how to avoid the flag --whole-archive when using the static library in windows

Hi everyone,
I have built the static library of tensorflow for C++ in windows. And I am trying to use this library in qtCreator, however I have the issue (no session factory registered for the given options). But, it looks adding these flags in qtCreator doesnÂ´t work so I still have the issue. Does someone know how to build the library in Tensorflow  so I can use the library without the flag -whole-archive?
