Add MNIST dataset loader in Go binding

As well as python examples, MNIST dataset is good resource for tutorial and examples in Go API.
In addition to this, it might be better to write examples using MNIST like logistic regression or CNN but Go binding API (wrappers.go) looks so different from python API. Could you let me know if there is good resource to write MNIST example in Go?
