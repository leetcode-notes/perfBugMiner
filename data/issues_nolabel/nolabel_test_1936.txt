Can't re-install tensorflow

Hi Everyone,
I have encountered a problem. I installed the tensorflow version 0.7.0, and using it to test mnist example, which outputted the error “AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gfile'”
I searched for the solution about this error, and realised that I need to roll back to version 0.6.0 or version 0.7.1, so I did un-installed the tensorflow and tried to install version 0.7.1 using
sudo -H pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-any.whl
However, it gave me the error:
Exception:

As I checked, easy_install is lying in the directory  '/usr/local/bin/easy_install' , I don't know why this error happened.
Please help me solve this problem. It drives me crazy!!!!
Thank you!!
