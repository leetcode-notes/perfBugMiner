RecordInput blocks if buffer_size is larger than the amount of files in tfrecords.

If the buffer_size keyword argument in data_flow_ops.RecordInput(file_pattern, .. buffer_size=buffer_size) is larger than the amount of files inside of file_pattern, the op will block forever.
This is slightly related to #11372, another case where RecordInput blocks forever.
Not sure how difficult/possible it would be to check for this or throw an error when this occurs. Feel free to mark this as closed if this is intended behaviour.
