tf.keras: Warn user when they mix up `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` and `categorical_crossentropy`

Sometimes we convert one-hot labels to integer labels, and forget to change the loss function categorical_crossentropy to sparse_categorical_crossentropy.
Because categorical_crossentropy doesn't check the shape of target and output, tf.keras works well except a totally wrong result.
The PR only checks the last dimension of static shape for efficient, perhaps we'd better to check whole shape with help of tf.contrib.framework.with_same_shape?
