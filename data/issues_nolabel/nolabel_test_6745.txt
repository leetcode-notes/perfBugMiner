Tensor flow just stopped working all of a sudden

My new to tensorflow and I was following the tutorial on tensorflow for poets to train an image classifier on a Docker image of gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel and I got it up and running but then yesterday I told it to classify an image that it has classified before and it threw an error now when im trying to retain it I keep getting this error
