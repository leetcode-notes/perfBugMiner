Add the sched_getaffinity support for Android.

Now the NumSchedulableCPUs() always chooses to  return 4 cores for Android, other than try the Bionic supported sched_getaffinity to get the actual available cores. Here I remove the "!defined(ANDROID)" macro and just keep the " linux" macro to work for both pure-linux and android-linux platform.
The reason why we can drop the "ANDROID" marco is that the GNU toolchain would always has the system-specific predefined macros "linux"  setting to 1.
