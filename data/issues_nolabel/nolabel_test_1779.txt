Request: dynamic RNN in bidirectional_rnn()

The bidirectional_rnn() is not taking the advantages of dynamic_rnn(), it runs into memory issues for even moderate length of time steps. I guess this should be really easy to implement, but a really big help for people using the bidirectional version.
Thanks!
