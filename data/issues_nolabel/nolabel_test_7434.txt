InvalidArgumentError Invalid JPEG data, size 4096 for retain.py(image_retrain), Not JPEG file 0x00 0x05

Problem: when i run the retrain script with my sub_folder(my photos) shown in the Image retrain tutorial,
https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/image_retraining/
It gives that error, InvalidArgumentError Invalid JPEG data. I took a look at this thread #4009
And changed the tf.image.decode_jpeg to tf.image.decode_image, but no luck(i also made sure all the photos are jpeg). I am wondering the retrain script for the tutorial is there a Max-size set for the images? Because i couldnt find if there is a max-size, or if its still some problem with format of the photos i put in.
I have ran the flower_photos example with no problem, running on Ubuntu 16.04, CUDA 8.0.
Edit: I am using the flower_photos dataset from the tensorflow website, i used a USB stick to transfer the file to the window machine running virtual box Ubuntu 16.04, i deleted 4 sub_folders(only training daisy and dandelion), then the bottleneck process went through about 912 photos and suddenly a daisy photo had the same Invalid JPEG error. I am wondering if its because of the photos transfered through a USB from a Mac to Window then onto a virtual box causes JPEG to corrupt?
