How to update columns in tf.Values

I use tf.scatter_nd_update() method to update lines, but I not find any method to update columns. So I was wondering whether has a convenient way to update columns?
For example, data=tf.Values(tf.zeros([10,100])), and I want to update data with "data[:,0]=tf.ones([10])" or other methods like tf.scatter_nd_update.
I will appreciate it if anyone can help me!
