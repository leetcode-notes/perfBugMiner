Loading Multiple models into the same session of tensorflow

I have trained two models. en-fr and fr-en models. The fr-en model has different vocab size compared to the en-fr model. The first model is being loaded properly. It crashes while loading the second one. I have trained both the models separately. Please check the log file attached to see the error logs. kindly tell me the right way to go ahead.
I want to create a webservice for en-rf and fr-en translation. I ahve to load the models in a session for this, which is causing the problem. below is the piece of code. I am using the translate.py provided by tensorflow and the methods available in it.
`global en_fr_sess

 if en_fr_sess==None:
 en_fr_sess = tf.Session()

 global en_fr_model
 global en_fr_en_vocab_path
 global en_fr_fr_vocab_path

 en_fr_model = create_model(en_fr_sess, True)
 en_fr_model.batch_size = 1  
 fr_en_model = fr_en_create_model(en_fr_sess, True)
 fr_en_model.batch_size = 1`

I am able to run both the models separately and generate the translations. However, when I try to load both the models in the same session or even a different session one after the other, I get the following error
`ValueError: Variable embedding_attention_seq2seq/RNN/EmbeddingWrapper/embedding already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope? Originally defined at:`

Please find the detailed log file attached too. Kindly give me the inputs on how to proceed further.
