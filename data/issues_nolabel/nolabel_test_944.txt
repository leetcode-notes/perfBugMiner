Change types of constant numeric literals.

This PR fixes mismatched types in numeric literals usages.
For examples, use 'size_t{0}' and '1u' instead of '0' and '1' respectively.
This removes 26 simple compiler warnings in 20 files
on 'signed' and 'unsigned' comparisons on CHECK_* and DCHECK_* macros.
