Environment info
Operating System: ArchLinux x64 Anaconda Environment
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CPU Only Version
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
pip 8.1.1 from /opt/conda/envs/AI_Playground/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".
Tensorflow is not yet Installed
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:

Steps to reproduce

Install anaconda
Create Python3.5 environment
Follow tensorflow install guide for Anaconda

What have you tried?

The command the tutorial provides to create the env :

$ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
and then the command:
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
reference different c python versions 3.5 and c python 3.4 respectively.
I tried tweaking the version in the link to cp35 in both instances which resulted in a 404 error from the pip script. Which I kind of expected.
