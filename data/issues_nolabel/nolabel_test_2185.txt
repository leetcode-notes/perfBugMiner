How to compute confusion matrix from CNN example?

In the tutorial 'Convolutional Neural Networks', tensorflow just computed the accuracy, but I wanted to compute the confusion matrix. I have trained the model, saved the variable and don't want to do it again. I am able to load the variables. Then three approaches crossed my mind: give new input to cifar10.inference; replace with new operations; directly output the prediction result. But I failed all of them, because: the inference does not take placeholder, no such operation could be implemented; multi-threaded code stopped me.
I posted a more detailed way of my trial in stackoverflow. Please help. And even will be more grateful if solutions are given more than one.
Thanks in advance.
