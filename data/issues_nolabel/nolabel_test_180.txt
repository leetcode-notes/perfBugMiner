'state' is not defined

When I was trying to run the samples I got an error while running -> new_value = tf.add(state,one)
Error : Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
NameError: name 'state' is not defined



import tensorflow as tf
var = tf.Variable(0, name= "counter")
one = tf.constant(1)
new_value = tf.add(state,one)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
NameError: name 'state' is not defined
