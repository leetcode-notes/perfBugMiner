Unimplement: Op TopK is not available in GraphDef version 8.

Hi !
I've just finish to install TensorFlow on my OSX 10.11.13.
When I do: bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image
E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:275] Executor failed to create kernel. Unimplemented: Op TopK is not available in GraphDef version 8. It has been removed in version 7. Use TopKV2 instead. [[Node: top_k = TopK[T=DT_FLOAT, k=5, sorted=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](Const/_0)]] E tensorflow/examples/label_image/main.cc:321] Running print failed: Unimplemented: Op TopK is not available in GraphDef version 8. It has been removed in version 7. Use TopKV2 instead. [[Node: top_k = TopK[T=DT_FLOAT, k=5, sorted=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](Const/_0)]]
Did someone already seen this ?
