Fix failing test //tensorflow/python:function_test

@benoitsteiner It seems //tensorflow/python:function_test is failing with my last commit from #13998 (sorry about that).
It looks like the function_test created a graph with python through a helper class and invoked tests through c api.
I am not familiar with the function_test, though as ClipByValue is actually hidden, and is exposed through python only, with the gradient defined in python as well, I think replacing it will fix the issue?
Please take a look. Again, really sorry for the caused inconvenience.
