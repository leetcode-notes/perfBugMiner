Describe the problem
Hello. Thanks for TF.
Recently OpenCV has integrated dynamic dispatch allowing OpenCV library to leverage optimal code paths for supported hardware acceleration (sse, fma, avx, avx2 etc), from a single compiled binary. This is super useful for deployment builds when you are unsure what CPU family/features will potentially run your binary.
I understand TF's execution model and potentially XLA may add complications, not even to say GPU support - but for CPU ops, or CPU only deployments I imagine something equivalent would be well received.
While we are speaking of deployment builds, are folks just shipping non-optimized-for-client-hardware binaries, or compiling different builds for different hardware features for end products?
Thank you.
