Unable to run tensorboard

Hi all,
I'm trying to use tensorboard but I can't find the tensorboard executable in my path. I installed tensorflow with pip.
When trying to run it from source I got the following error
WARNING:root:IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/../tensorflow/external/paper-toggle-button/paper-toggle-button.html' on path /.../tensorflow/external/paper-toggle-button/paper-toggle-button.html
