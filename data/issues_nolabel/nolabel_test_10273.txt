Android build error: tensorflow/core/framework/op_gen_lib.h:22:59: fatal error

Hello,
I previously built (some earlier releases of tensorflow) succesfully for android platform (aarch64). However, I get this  following error "./tensorflow/core/framework/op_gen_lib.h:22:59: fatal error: tensorflow/core/framework/op_gen_overrides.pb.h: No such file or directory
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_gen_overrides.pb.h"
" incase of the latest release.
I did run "download_dependencies.sh", "compile_android_protobuf.sh" prior to the command "make -f ./tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile TARGET=ANDROID"
There is no file called "op_gen_overrides.pb.h"!
