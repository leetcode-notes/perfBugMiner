incorrect logging formatting used in tensorflow / examples / image_retraining / retrain.py, causes error

In tensorflow -> examples -> image_retraining -> retrain.py, currently lines 347 / 348 look like this:
tf.logging.info('Successfully downloaded', filename, statinfo.st_size,
                    'bytes.')

This understandably causes an error since this function accepts strings and it is being fed an instance of statinfo.st_size which does not seem to be a string.  On my machine at least (TensorFlow 1.5, Windows 10) this causes the following error in function maybe_download_and_extract:
TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
Here is a screenshot if that helps:

The line numbers are slightly different in my screenshot because I moved a few lines around, but I can assure you the line above is causing the logging error.
I would suggest changing this line to the following, or similar:
tf.logging.info('Successfully downloaded ' + str(filename) + ', statinfo.st_size = ' + str(statinfo.st_size) + ' bytes')
