import frozen graph with batchnorm error

Error when loading the frozen graph with batchnorm.
It shows: ValueError: graph_def is invalid at node u'bn_0/cond/ExponentialMovingAverage/AssignMovingAvg/Switch': Input tensor 'bn_0/bn_0/moments/Squeeze/ExponentialMovingAverage:0' Cannot convert a tensor of type float32 to an input of type float32_ref.
It is same as the question #3628, and could anyone give me a proper solution for it?
