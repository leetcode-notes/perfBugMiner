No mod for int32 no GPU kernel support

I apologize if this is not actually a issue. When trying to put tf.reduce_mean() on the gpu, I get the following error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'gradients/Mean_grad/mod': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available
         [[Node: gradients/Mean_grad/mod = Mod[T=DT_INT32, _device="/device:GPU:0"](gradients/Mean_grad/add, gradients/Mean_grad/Size)]]

I am on commit 43a8c49 from Tue 5/24/2016.
You can reproduce this by modifying the mnist/convolutional.py file by putting the tf.reduce_mean() and optimizer.minimize() inside "with tf.device('/gpu:0'):" statements.
I am trying to do gradient calculations on their respective gpu towers, but compute_gradients() gets hung up on tf.reduce_mean().
Thank you,
Mark
