Hard-code libcuda version number to "1". Fixes #2865.

As per comments from nvidia-docker dev @3XX0, hardcoding "1" should be
reasonably safe. The TF_CUDA_VERSION variable from the configure script
is not appropriate here (it will contain something like "7.0" or "7.5",
while the libcuda soname major version number should be "1").
