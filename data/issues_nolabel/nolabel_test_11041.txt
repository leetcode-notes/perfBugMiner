Update logging in DNNClassifier to use tf.summary.scalar

System information

I am using the stock DNNClassifier in contrib/learn. The warning is present in every instance where DNNClassifier is called.
Present in OSX (Mac OS 10.12.5) and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Present both on binary and when compiled from source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.2.0 (release) and v1.2.0-1371-g97af82d53 1.2.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: Call the DNN classifier as indicated in https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/DNNClassifier

Describe the problem
A warning for a deprecated feature is cluttering the logs when using the DNNClassifier. It is due to the use of the deprecated feature scalar_summary while logging. While this has been deprecated in 2016-11-30, it is still used in tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py:642
This bug report request for updating the the current tf.summary.scalar, as indicated. The usability of the product is much improved as a consequence.
Logs
WARNING:tensorflow:From /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py:642: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.

    # Uses the deprecated API to set the tag explicitly.
    # Without it, training and eval losses will show up in different graphs.
