tf.image.resize_bilinear has nearest neighbor gradients when downscaling

System information

Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

Describe the problem
When using tf.image.resize_bilinear to downscale, the gradients of the output w.r.t. the input is the same as what we get from nearest neighbors. For instance, using the code below you can confirm that the gradients are being sparsely backpropagated to specific pixels of the input image.
Source code / logs
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf


if __name__ == '__main__':
    session = tf.Session()

    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 16, 16, 3])
    x_low = tf.image.resize_bilinear(x, (4, 4))
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(x_low)
    loss_grad = tf.gradients(loss, x)

    grad = session.run(loss_grad, {x: np.ones([1, 16, 16, 3], dtype=np.float32)})[0]
    grad = grad[0, ...].transpose(2, 0, 1)
    print(grad)  # should not be sparse, but it is

    session.close()

The output is:
