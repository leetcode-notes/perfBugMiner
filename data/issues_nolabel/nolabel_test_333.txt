Issue with _create_slots: var_list[0].device empty

I have problem running
loss = crossentropy(activation, y)
train_loss = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

with crossentropy defined in another file as a simple function that return
def crossentropy(activation, y)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(activation, y))

I got this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test/test.py", line 66, in <module>
    train_loss = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss) # Adam Optimizer
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/optimizer.py", line 167, in minimize
    name=name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/optimizer.py", line 245, in apply_gradients
    self._create_slots([v for g, v in grads_and_vars if g is not None])
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/adam.py", line 87, in _create_slots
    with ops.device(var_list[0].device):
IndexError: list index out of range

But this is working: (only call function from another file is not)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(activation, y))
train_loss  = self.optimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

It seemed I can't define that expression outside the main thread, I also tried using same graph as default graph, but it doesn't seem to work either. I think this is an issue with graph building.
If you ever ran into this problem, thanks for helping!
