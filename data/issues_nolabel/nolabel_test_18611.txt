Improve shape function check for `tf.roll`

The tf.roll op has requirements for the shape of inputs. However, the shape of the inputs are only done at the runtime inside the kernel.
This fix improve the shape function so that the check could be done early if shape is already known in the shape function.
The following validations have been added in the shape function with test cases:

The input must be 1-D or higher
The shift must be scalar or 1-D.
The axis must be scalar or 1-D.
The  shift and axis should be the same size.

They matches validations in the kernel.
