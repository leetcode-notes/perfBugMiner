TF Detect app doesnt work with my own weights

Hello guys, I followed the instruction of object detection android app and successfully run the app using the pretrained tiny-yolo-voc.
Now I have trained another model by myself with my own dataset(1class) using Darknet. Then I convert the weights file to pb type format using the Darkflow command
./flow --model cfg/yolo-1class.cfg --load bin/yolo-marker_1class.weights --savepb --verbalise
Using the summerize_graph tool, I checked the yolo-marker_1class.pb has the same 'input' and 'output' node.
After i manually copy this pb file into the asset folder and click Run button, I had this error which is not happened when I build when the pretrained tiny-yolo-voc.pb
Can anyone help me please ?
