Custom optimiser based on pre-trained model

Hello. This might be a support ticket or a feature request.
I'm trying to make an optimiser based on output of a pretrained model. Running a model requires an open session in tensorflow but there is nothing like it inside OpKernel where the existing model should be called.
How to correctly call a model inside an opkernel? Is it possible to access already compiled functionality  of this kind?
This feature would be very handy when it comes to complex loss functions. I'm able to write it on my own and wrap it in a PR when my questions are resolved.
