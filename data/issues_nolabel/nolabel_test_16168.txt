Fix unicode string conversion issue in Python 2

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #16149 where the unicode string conversion with Python 2 does not match the behavior with Python 3.
The issue was that in Python 3, TensorFlow tries to do a unicode conversion in UTF8 while in Python 2
the default conversion was used.
This fix addresses the issue so that behaviors of TensorFlow with Python 2 and Python 3 match.
This fix fixes #16149.
