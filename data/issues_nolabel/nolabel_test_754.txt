Allow sessions to be started in cpu-only mode.

I would find it convenient to be able to start a session in cpu only mode (e. g. because you have another session running already that hogs all the VRAM). My workaround for now is to use
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.01)
with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True, gpu_options=gpu_options)) as sess:

And then wrap with tf.device('/cpu:0'): around the model construction.
