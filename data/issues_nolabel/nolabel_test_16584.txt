TensorFlow op to copy weights of Keras model

I am doing a distributed calibration of an LSTM model (keras 2.0 + TensorFlow 1.0)
with tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(...):
      model = ##create model by keras
      clone_model = ## create the same model by keras but now a stateful one

after calibration, I want my chief worker to use the clone_model, copy the weights the calibration reached in model, and make predictions on some test set, but simply calling
 clone_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

does not work.
I understand I need to define this weight copy as an op and then call session(run) of that op
Can you please help with a TensorFlow op copying weights of a keras model to another (identical architecture) Keras model?
