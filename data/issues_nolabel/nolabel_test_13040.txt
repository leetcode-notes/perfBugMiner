Feature request: Dataset.from_py_func

I have an input pipeline that is especially complex. It is coded entirely in plain Python. While it may be possible to reimplement it in TensorFlow operations, that would be a huge amount of work and take far too much time to be worth it right now.
It would be great if I could hook my existing pipeline into the new Dataset approach via something like Dataset.from_py_func. One would pass a reference to a Python function that has no inputs and, when executed, acts as a generator that yields examples one-at-a-time as numpy arrays. For example:
def generate():
    for example in complex_input_pipeline():
        yield example

dataset = Dataset.from_py_func(generate)
# Do normal things with dataset

I've been unable to figure out a way to do something like this using existing functionality so it would be great if it could be added.
