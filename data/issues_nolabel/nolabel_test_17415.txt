Dataset API 'flat_map' method producing error for same code which works with 'map' method

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Custom code


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Windows 10


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary


TensorFlow version (use command below):  1.6.0


Python version: 3.5


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/7.0


GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 860M


Exact command to reproduce: dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda file_name: tf.py_func(_get_data_for_dataset, [file_name], tf.float64))


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I am trying to create a create a pipeline to read mulitple CSV files using TensorFlow Dataset API and Pandas. However using the 'flat_map' method is producing errors. However if I am using 'map' method I am able to build the code and run it in session. This is the code I am using.
Source code / logs
folder_name = './data/power_data/'
file_names = os.listdir(folder_name)
def _get_data_for_dataset(file_name,rows=100):#
    print(file_name.decode())
    
    df_input=pd.read_csv(os.path.join(folder_name, file_name.decode()),
                         usecols =['Wind_MWh','Actual_Load_MWh'],nrows = rows)
    X_data = df_input.as_matrix()
    X_data.astype('float32', copy=False)
    
    return X_data
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(file_names)
dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda file_name: tf.py_func(_get_data_for_dataset, [file_name], tf.float64))
dataset= dataset.batch(2)
iter = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
get_batch = iter.get_next()`

I get the following error: map_func must return a Dataset object. It would also great if you could provide documentation on using Dataset API with Pandas module.
