feature request: could tfdbg dump out debug data by specified step range?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.12.4(BuildVersion: 16E195)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.3.0-rc1-1702-g512d3d086', '1.3.0')
Python version: Python 2.7.13 (default, Apr  4 2017, 08:47:57)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4-homebrew(Build time: Fri Aug 25 16:55:29 2017 (1503680129))
CUDA/cuDNN version: null
GPU model and memory: null
Exact command to reproduce: sess = dumping_wrapper.DumpingDebugWrapperSession(sess, session_root="<dump_path>", log_usage=False)

feature request description
I find that DumpingDebugWrapperSession in dumping_wrapper.py dumps debug data for each step, which makes the training very slow with hundreds (thousands?) of small files being generated. In fact, sometimes it is not necessary for us to need the information of all steps to debug.
So, could tfdbg dump out debug data by specified step range? Thanks.
