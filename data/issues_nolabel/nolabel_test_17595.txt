Feature Request: quantize_weights does a signed_quantization [-127,+127] as well

**OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 14.04/16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source v1.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): bazel release 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:  v8
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA gtx1060
Have I written custom code: No
Exact command to reproduce:


tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms:transform_graph

Only does an unsigned quantization of the weights. I think it is useful for many that we have a signed quantization so that a normal distribution having a median of zero (0.0f) converts to a TF-8 0. This is useful in general. Thanks.
