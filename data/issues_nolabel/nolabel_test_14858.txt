off-by-one bug in graph_editor get_forward_walk_ops

This line converts Tensor to its corresponding op by replacing it with its consuming op
seed_ops = util.get_consuming_ops(ts)
Instead it should replace it with its producing op
seed_ops = [t.op for t in ts]
This would makes get_forward_walk_ops(tensor give same result as get_forward_walk_ops(tensor.op which was probably the intention of this function
I know contrib isn't really supported, but wanted to file this bug in order to reference it in work-arounds in my code
