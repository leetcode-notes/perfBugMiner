New seq2seq interface(basic_decoder) does not support sampled softmax?

basic_decoder init function has param output_layer which must be a type of layer like Dense.
But for using sampled softmax we need some code like below, as w_t and v is needed by tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss
with tf.variable_scope('output_projection'):
self.w_t = melt.variable.get_weights_truncated('w',
[vocab_size, num_units],
stddev=FLAGS.weight_stddev)
#weights
self.w = tf.transpose(self.w_t)
#biases
self.v = melt.variable.get_weights_truncated('v',
[vocab_size],
stddev=FLAGS.weight_stddev)
for old seq2seq interface, we can just pass output_function like
def output_fn(output):
return tf.nn.xw_plus_b(output, self.w, self.v )
How can we do sampled softmax with seq2seq new internface ?
