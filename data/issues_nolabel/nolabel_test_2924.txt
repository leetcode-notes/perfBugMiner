Problems and solutions in installing tf on Redhat

I encountered several problems in installing tensorflow on Redhat system. I solved them by googling solutions. Hope my experience may be helpful to some users.
OS version: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2 (Santiago)
Linux kernel: 2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64
Problems and solutions:
1. glibc version is too low
Install higer version glibc, e.g. glibc-2.17.
Please use at least version 2.17. You can configure the installation using --prefix option to specify the path to install, and then modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the new glibc library.
2. link problem after install higher version of glibc
Error info looks like:
"
error while loading shared libraries: __vdso_time: invalid mode for dlopen():Invalid argument
"
You need to use the following method to run a program (eg. python):
/path/to/glibc-2.17/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path /path/to/glibc-2.17/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/gcc-5.2.0/lib64:/usr/lib64/ /path/to/anaconda/bin/python2.7
3. numpy version problem
Install new version of numpy using pip.
4. protobuf3 not found, and
Error in python after 'import tensorflow': TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'syntax'
pip install 'protobuf>=3.0.0a3'
5.  failed call to cuInit: CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE
Explicitly specify a cuda device in you environment variable:
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
6. libcuda.so.1 not found
Explicitly specify the path of this lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
libcuda.so is in usually in /usr/lib64
7. ELFCLASS32 error
elf is incorrect, should use a 64-bits .so file (usually in */lib64)
8. glibc 2.15 cannot create regular file `/var/db/Makefile': Permission denied
Use glibc 2.17 or  even higher version.
