Documentation for seq2seq

Hello
I want to use the Tensorflow seq2seq library (I'm doing the Udacity Deep Learning course, Assignment 6).  I can't find anything that documents what functions are available, and the details of all the arguments that can be used for each function (ie what is documented for the Tensorflow API).
The library is referenced in the Sequence to Sequence Models tutorial - a tantalising amount of detail is given, but not enough to work with.
I've googled the subject and searched in stack-overflow - a few posts reference the library but they don't give documentation.
I found this:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/models/rnn/translate/translate.py
    
    
         Line 132
      in
      63409bd
    
    
    
    

        
          
           def train(): 
        
    
  



which, I think, gives the code but this is a lower level than I was hoping for!

I also found the link below on Tensorflow site - maybe the most promising - but none of the links work:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/contrib.legacy_seq2seq/#sequence_loss
Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Apologies if I've come to the wrong place (I've read the Guidelines) - the Support options on the Tensorflow site linked to Github or Stack overflow.
Thanks
Kathryn
