Describe the problem
In distributed tensorflow, if I do multiple dequeue from a remote FIFOQueue, duplicate results will be popped. For example, 1 2 3 4 5 were pushed into the FIFOQueue, then the popped results may be 1 1 2 3 4 4 5. Is it a bug? Or designed feature?
The code is posted above. Logs is also in that gist.
