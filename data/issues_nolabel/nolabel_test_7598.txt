make tf_upgrade.py more useful

When we upgrade tf code to version 1.0.0 in a directory tree, some times we also want to copy all the other files from intree to the outtreeï¼Œthis makes it easier to upgrade an entire project.
So I add an option named --copyotherfiles in tf_upgrade.py. Hopefully useful!
# just upgrade the .py files
tf_upgrade.py --intree coolcode --outtree coolcode-upgraded
# after upgrade the .py files, then copy all the other files to the outtree
tf_upgrade.py --intree coolcode --outtree coolcode-upgraded --copyotherfiles True
