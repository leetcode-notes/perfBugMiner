BeamSearchDecoder cell state never changed

tf version '1.1.0-rc2'
It looks BeamSearchDecoder never used next_cell_state, but always using the inital cell state.
In beam_search_decoder.py 423
next_cell_state = nest.map_structure(
self._maybe_split_batch_beams,
next_cell_state, self._cell.state_size)
But next_cell_state is never used later, since just pass   state to _beam_search_step function where state.cell_state is never changed
beam_search_output, beam_search_state = _beam_search_step(
time=time,
logits=cell_outputs,
beam_state=state,
batch_size=batch_size,
beam_width=beam_width,
end_token=end_token,
length_penalty_weight=length_penalty_weight)
