fixed issue #4903

as mentioned in #4903,
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L47
it directly run main function which doesn't run the argument parser in if name=="main".
I am not sure if FLAGS is used in somewhere else, so I moved the parser part into a function to update FLAGS in main() function.
Not sure if this is the right way to fix, but it works for both running through
python tesnsorboard.py --logdir=AAA
and
tensorbaord --logdir=AAA
