Misleading argument name on seq2seq module

Not really major issue, but can make lose some time.
For the functions sequence_loss_by_example and sequence_loss, the name of the parameter softmax_loss_function seems to imply that only softmax based loss are compatibles which is not true (for instance tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits works too). Maybe the name was that just to indicate the default behavior but I find it misleading.
It shouldn't be really difficult to change (as there are very few references in the repository). I can send a pull request if needed.
