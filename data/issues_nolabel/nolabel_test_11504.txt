The previous commit attempted to fix a problem for PowerPC

architectures, which require a different gcc optimization argument.
However, this addition had two implementation errors, which caused all
architectures to receive this deprecated compiler flag and therefore
produce a non-optimized tensorflow compilation.
Specifically, the introduced 'is_ppc()' used a syntactically incorrect variable
identification '${}' in the statement where command substitution '$()' should
have been used. This caused the command to always silently fail, and the
function to always return true regardless of architecture.
Additionally, where the function was called, the return value should be
controlling the if statement, but by encapsulating the call with '[..]', the
resulting expression evaluation was also always true.
