Object Tracking Support

I have a bug after updating to the latest android studio and building the detection app with it.
For previous versions of android studio I didn't have this issue before
when I ran the tf_detect app it showed an error for few seconds that says "Object Tracking Support Not Found..."
and when I add the line "dependencies {
compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:+'
}"
to the gradle build file it shows another error
Error:(42, 0) Could not find method compile() for arguments [org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:+] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.
Open File
any suggestions or fixes to this issue please?
What am I doing:
I have created a custom trained detector and it was working fine till android studio was updated. I have even tried with a fresh copy of the original demo and I have the same error. Yet when I downloaded the nightly build apk it didn't show any error. so it must be the android studio / tensorflow compatibility / dependency issue here.
Thanks
