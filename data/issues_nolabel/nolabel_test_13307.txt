[XLA] Register the input arguments with the XlaAllocator

If an op returns one if its inputs as an output, then the XlaAllocator needs to be able to notice the buffer and find the original tensor.
This adds a method to the XlaAllocator to allow this action, and calls it with all of the inputs and variables (but not the runtime context).
