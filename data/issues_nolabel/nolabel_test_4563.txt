Fix to download eigen library

URL for eigen library is extracted from tensorflow/workspace.bzl,
but expression is used to construct the URL in the code,
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/workspace.bzl#L22
so extracted URL using simple grep is not correct.
This change get version code for eigen library from the file,
and construct URL with it.
It looks cmake handles the URL in same way:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/external/eigen.cmake#L13
