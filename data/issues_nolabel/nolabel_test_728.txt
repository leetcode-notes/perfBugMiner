Adding basic CMake support

This PR adds very basic CMake support, to unblock people who can't use Bazel (eg. Windows users).
The CMake files are all located in the cmake subdirectory.  Usage:
cd cmake
mkdir build & cd build
mkdir release & cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..

This builds the tutorial C++ training example (along with all dependencies).
Limitations: no GPU, no python, no tests, no install targets, tested only on MacOSX, and needs a bit of code cleanup.  It's a first version to get the ball rolling.
