Add a custom tag for use by fusion ops

Currently when replacing an op with a fusion of many, the information which is carried by that fusion op is limited to a small fixed enumeration.
I have previously added a 'custom' entry to that enumeration, however it isn't really enough to label an arbitrary and non-fixed set of fuse results.
This adds a general integer that can be used by any back end to label fused ops arbitrarily.
There are other ways to achieve this:

replacing the FusionKind enumeration with an integer field
allowing read-write access to the metadata structure, and replacing it with something like a map
some other thing I can't think of right now.

I'm happy to go with a different scheme, but I do think that the HloInstruction needs an annotation interface of some kind.
