Install name fix for libtensorflow.so

There exists a problem with the built shared library for Mac. If ones creates a shared library that depends on libtensorflow.so and distributes it in a folder, along with libtensorflow.so, then the Mac linker will failed to load the library, unless libtensorflow.so is in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is problematic when libraries are distributed together as a package (e.g., in the context of JNI). From what I read online, this can be fixed using @rpath. This is what this patch is about and it seems to work in my experiments.
