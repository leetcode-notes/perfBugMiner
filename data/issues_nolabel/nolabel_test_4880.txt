Needed to install `pbr` and `funcsigs`

I was following the Pip Installation instructions.  When I ran the Test the TensorFlow installation steps, I hit two errors, listed below.
The Fix!
To fix, I ran pip install pbr funcsigs, then the test Python program worked.
Environment info
Operating System: Mac OSX 10.10.5
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
I installed this one:

# Mac OS X, CPU only, Python 2.7:
$ export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-py2-none-any.whl


The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

0.11.0rc0

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I was following the existing instructions, I don't think I missed any steps...
Logs or other output that would be helpful
Here are the two errors that I saw:
