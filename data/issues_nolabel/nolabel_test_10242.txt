Fixed tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_norm to handle zero sequence length.

The original version of tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_norm can not produce zero output when the sequence length is zero or a negtive number, which will leads tf.contrib.crf_log_likelihood to produce non-zero output, so that the training procedure can be disturbed.
This patch force the output to be zero when the sequence length is equal or less than zero.
