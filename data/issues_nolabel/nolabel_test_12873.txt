Efficient way to load a model over 2GiB with C++ interface?

Hi,all
When applying TF model with its C++ interface, freeze_graph operations, for the graph file and the cpk file, are required. This operation will then generate a dumped binary protobuffer file.
However, protobuffer does not support to dump a file that is larger than 2GiB.
In this case, what's the right way to load a big model in TF, with its C++ interface? Any clues will be appriciated.
Thank you
