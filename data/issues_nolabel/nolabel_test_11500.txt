allocate_output can result in OOM error

TF-commit: 7f00845
Describe the problem
When implementing custom operations, allocating output twice (as a bug) should give at least a warning. The following code
    Tensor* tensor = nullptr;
    OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output(0, output_shape, &tensor));
    OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output(0, output_shape, &tensor));
gives a nearly un-debuggable OOM error after many iterations during runtime. Is it possible to prevent  allocate_output(i,...) being called with the same i twice?
