changes in  ops_to_register.h file does not effect resulting compilation

System information

Have I written custom code (#14215):
OS Platform and Distribution (Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source ):
TensorFlow version (1.4):
**Python version  2.7:
Bazel version (0.7.0):

Describe the problem
I have been running print_selective_registration_header to produce libtensorflow_inference.so
for android as described in : tensorflow/tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header.py
i saw that ops_to_register.h was created correctly but the resulting    libtensorflow_inference.so did not work in android and there were always missing kernel ops errors,
i repeated the process with a few different graphs and i have noticed that the ops_to_register.h is being updated but there were no changes in the resulting libtensorflow_inference.so file.
i have tried all the possible bazel clean option and bazel dump thinking it is a bazel caching issue.
none helped ,
i opened this issue thinking it is an android bug :#14215
and closed it once i understood that the issue is that the result of the bazel build is worng
can anyone check this out?
