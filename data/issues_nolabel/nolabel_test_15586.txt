WIP: Remove invalid merge_repeated option from CTC beam decoder

The CTC beam decoding implicitly collapses repeated characters as part of calculating the optimal path (i.e. 'AAA' will contribute probability mass through the path 'A').
So the correct CTC decoding behavior occurs when merge_repeated=False. In this case, it DOES merge repeated characters. The merge_repeated flag, when true, will merge repeated characters after characters have already been merged/blank symbols removed. As it stands now, the behavior is extremely misleading.
This PR removes the misleading parameter from the ctc beam search op.
Closes #9550.
