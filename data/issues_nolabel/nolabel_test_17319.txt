Model trained with `tf.data.Dataset` can not be converted to `dlc` file of snpe

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.4
Python version:
3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0
GPU model and memory:
24G
Exact command to reproduce:

I trained a model with estimator and  tf.data.Dataset. But I can not convert the model file to .dlc file of snpe.
As you all know, the following lines are included in input function:
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
imgs = iterator.get_next()
return imgs

Then, I converted my checkpoint file with freeze_graph.py and get a .pb file. And the first three node names are shown below:
['OneShotIterator',
 'IteratorGetNext',
 'holi/conv2d/kernel',
 ...]

Thus, I think the input node is OneShotIterator.
And I tried to convert the .pb file to .dlc file of snpe. Lines below are the command I found from the documentation of snpe:
snpe-tensorflow-to-dlc --graph $SNPE_ROOT/models/inception_v3/tensorflow/inception_v3.pb
                       --input_dim Mul 299,299,3 --dlc inception_v3.dlc --out_node softmax

The Mul is the input node name, 299,299,3 is the input node shape.
My input node is OneShotIterator, which has no shape however.
I do not think it is a good idea to take an iterator as a model input, any idea to change that? Or any solution to convert my .pb file to .del file?
Looking forward to your reply.
