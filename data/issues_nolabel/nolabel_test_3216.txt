after freezing a graph the inference time is slower than when restoring variables from checkpoint

I'm using the  freeze_graph.py script that takes a graph definition and the corresponding checkpoint to combine them them into a single file (variables are replaced by constants). On my system (Linux, titanx tensorflow R0.9) I'm measuring aprox 50% slower inference time compared to the same graph running with  variables restored from the checkpoint file.
Is it normal?
Thanks
