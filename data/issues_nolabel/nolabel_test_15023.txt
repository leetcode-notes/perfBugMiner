Fix a BUILD file bug in `tensorflow/contrib/cloud/BUILD`

In tensorflow/contrib/cloud, invoking bigquery_reader_ops_test will fail.
The error is caused by the the fact that bigquery_reader_ops_test depends on :bigquery_reader_ops_op_lib and :bigquery_reader_ops.
However, bigquery_reader_ops_test is in python, :bigquery_reader_ops_op_lib and :bigquery_reader_ops are cc libraries. So they shouldn't be the dependencies of bigquery_reader_ops_test.
This fix removes the above two dependencies so that bigquery_reader_ops_test could run successfully.
Below is the full error message before this PR.
