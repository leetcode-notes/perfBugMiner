Add adaptive softmax implemtation in nn_impl.py

Add a implementation of AdaptiveSoftmax, see Efficient softmax approximation for GPUs for detail.
This is a faster way to train a softmax classifier over a huge number of  classes, and can be used for both training and prediction.
It has been tested for language modeling on PTB (Penn Treebank) and GBW (Google Billion Word) corpus, and achieved a good result.
See detail experiment result: tf-adaptive-softmax-lstm-lm.
