[OpenCL] Provides SYCL kernels for 3D pooling (#97)

[OpenCL] Adds SYCL kernels for 3D pooling

Uses simple SYCL kernels to provide implementations for all 3D pooling
ops currently in use. These kernels pass the tests, but haven't really
been optimized.
These need benchmarking to compare with Eigen and CPU kernels.

[OpenCL] Refactors SYCL kernels to use parameter struct

Moves a lot of the functor parameters into a separate data struct, with
the aim of simplifying the functor code.

[OpenCL] Removes extra fetching of tensor dimensions

We already had the tensor dimensions passed into
LaunchMaxPooling3dGradOP, so don't need to fetch them from the
tensor.

[OpenCL] Renames SYCL 3D pooling kernels

Adds '3D' to kernel names.


[OpenCL] Adds 3D pooling SYCL kernel documentation


[OpenCL] Adds guards around SYCLDevice typedef


[OpenCL] Use forward input for SYCL MaxPool3DGradGrad


When we had a mix of SYCL and CPU kernels the forward_input would break
and cause computation problems. Now that we have SYCL kernels for all 3D
pooling operations, this is not a problem.


[OpenCL] Reformats SYCL 3D pooling code


[OpenCL] Moves SYCL utils into separate header


[OpenCL] Simplifies SYCL Pool param contructors


Instead of each constructor initialising the data, simplifies the
constructors to call the first constructor.
