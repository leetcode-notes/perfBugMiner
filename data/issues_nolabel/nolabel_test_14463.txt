added CMake options to provide external zlib, GRPC, Eigen

Here are changes necessary to build tensorflow with different version of GRPC, Protobuf, Eigen, zlib, etc. It is not possible to compile project using two different versions of protobuf for example. To deal with that I've chosen approach similar to one in GRPC library. Also for some reason I don't see changes from #13867 in master, thus changes from that branch are also here, @mrry might know something.
