Feature Request: plug-in support for new devices

We need to be able to support using new devices in TensorFlow without requiring editing the TensorFlow binary source code.
This requires a few changes.  Among many others:

The ability to dynamically register an implementation / factories for alternative devices
New or better APIs for allowing OpKernel's to use arbitrary device resources (e.g., right now we assume either the use of StreamExecutor or EigenDevice implementations, but that's obviously not general).
