Typos in the example. Their shape [4, 4, 1] is fixed to [1, 4, 4, 1]

[4, 4, 1] is fixed to [1, 4, 4, 1]
x = [[[1],   [2],  [3],  [4]],
     [[5],   [6],  [7],  [8]],
     [[9],  [10], [11],  [12]],
     [[13], [14], [15],  [16]]]

x's shape is [4, 4, 1], and this throws the "tf.space_to_depth() requires tensors with exactly 4 dimensions" error.
This PR fixes it to  [1, 4, 4, 1]:
