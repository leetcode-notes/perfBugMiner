Any reason to not publish wheels for Mac OS < 10.11.x on PyPI?

The tensorflow wheels for Mac OS on PyPI are tagged with a platform of 10.11 and thus aren't picked up by pip on Mac OS 10.10.x or earlier. Google hosts wheels that work on any version of Mac OS (e.g., https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.1-py2-none-any.whl).
Can these be uploaded to PyPI or can a wheel be published there that supports older versions of Mac OS?
