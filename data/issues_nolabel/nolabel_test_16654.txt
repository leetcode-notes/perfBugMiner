Bazel version comparison fails with bazel 0.10.0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No, just commented 6 lines in the bzl files out
OS Platform and Distribution: 16.04 on Jetson TX2
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.10.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: TX2 GPU, 5GB (not sure)
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build -c opt --local_resources 3072,4.0,1.0 --verbose_failures --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I cannot build tensorflow using bazel 0.10.0. It seems like the version checks in repositories.bzl and wokspace.bzl fail. Commenting them out solves the issue, even though I know that is no persistent solution. I think it is simply that bazel thinks that 0.10.0 is smaller 0.5.4 due to its string comparison, but I am no bazel expert.
