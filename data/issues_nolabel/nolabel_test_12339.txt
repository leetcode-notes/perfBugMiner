Feature suggestion: Keep_dim for slicing and list-based slicing with __getitem__ in Tensors and Variables

Sometimes it would be helpful to maintain the dimension when accessing a particular slice of a tensor or a variable. In NumPy this is possible by slicing with a list index like so:
ndarr = np.ones((5, 4, 3))
ndarr[: 1, :]  # Shape [5, 3]
ndarr[: [1], :]  # Shape [5, 1, 3]

It would be great to have similar list-based indexing which is essentially similar to what tf.gather_nd.
