skflow save sets absolute paths for checkpoint that break on production

Environment info
Running on latest nightly build.
Steps to reproduce

Save an estimator to a folder (let's call it classifier.model)
Attempt to restore on another machine in different machine

This breaks since the checkpoint file is pointing to the place in the new machine.
What have you tried?

Manually changing the path in the checkpoint file fixes the issue
