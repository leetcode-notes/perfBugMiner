Improve input tensor structure validation algorithm

Existing code that does input tensor validation is unable to check slices sizes properly.
Consider this input:
[][][]float32{{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, {{1}, {3}}, {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}}}
NewTensor() currently treat this input as valid one.
This patch fixes this behaviour and also simplifies the check by removing unnecessary for cycles.
