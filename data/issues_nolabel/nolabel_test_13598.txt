Fix discrepancy between docs and registered kernels for `tf.ones_like`/`tf.zeros_like`

This fix tries to address the discrepancy between docs and registered kernels for tf.ones_like. From the implementations the OnesLike/ZerosLike are registered with all POD types. However, in the documentation several data types are missing (uint8, int8, uint16, int16, bool).
This fix addresses the issue by adding missing types to documentation.
