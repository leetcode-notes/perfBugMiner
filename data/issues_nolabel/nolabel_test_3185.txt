Udacity Notebook with "None" kernel

I use Jupyter notebook to open the .ipynb files, but it shows a red "None" kernel on top right corner and all lines of code cannot run.
Method I use:

Build a new directory and extract .ipynb files from examples/udacity to the directory
In terminal, run jupyter notebook
