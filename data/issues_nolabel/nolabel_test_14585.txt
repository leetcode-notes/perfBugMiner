how to change the gpu_fraction_per_process from default 1 to 0.5 or 0.7?

I want to change the gpu_fraction_per_process from default 1 to 0.5 or 0.7.
Not by adding the below in my code
import tensorflow as tf
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.2)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))

Is there other method to change it in the tensorflow source file??
In the case of Keras, I can change it by modifying keras.json file.
I spent a lot of time to find the way though, I cannot find the way ..
Is it impossible???
