Fixed incorrect documentation in tf.contrib.nn.deprecated_flipped_spa…

…rse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits where it referenced labels rather than logits.
I was looking to fix #14450, but was unable to because it seems the site documentation is not the same as the in file documentation in master (which is correct in that case). It seems someone fixed it in master but the change was not made to 1.4. However, incidentally I noticed this identical error on tf.contrib.nn.deprecated_flipped_sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits. In this case, the error is on both the in file documentation and the website documentation.
