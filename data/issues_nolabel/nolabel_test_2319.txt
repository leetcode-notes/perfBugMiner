tf.constant does not raise an error if too few values are provided

It is difficult to see the current behavior (repeating the final value) being useful for anyone:
>>> tf.constant(np.arange(5), shape=(10,)).eval()
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4])

In contrast, there is a sensible error message if too many values are provided:
>>> tf.constant(np.arange(5), shape=(3,)).eval()
ValueError: Too many elements provided. Needed at most 3, but received 5

I am running the internal version of TensorFlow.
