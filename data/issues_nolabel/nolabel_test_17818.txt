Variadic arguments for tf.control_dependencies

Disclaimer: this is a UX proposal for the Python API but it should be discussed first!
Proposal
I see a lot of people get tripped up on tf.control_dependencies as they often try to pass a single tensor/op to it and forget to explicitly wrap it in a Python list. Perhaps it would be better to support both usages, as that is more in line with how tf.keras does things.
TL;DR: This commit changes tf.control_dependencies so that it takes a list as before, but also works with variadic arguments as well.
with tf.control_dependencies(tf.assert_positive(x)):
  x = tf.identity(x)
