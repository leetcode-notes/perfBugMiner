Fix the script entry point for freeze_graph.

The wrapper created by setup.py calls the entry point
function with no arguments. freeze_graph.main expects
the global FLAGS to be set, and one argument.
This change adds a run_main function to use as the entry point,
which expects no arguments and parses the flags.
It also adds a flags argument to freeze_graph.main so the flags
can be passed directly without using a global FLAGS declaration.
