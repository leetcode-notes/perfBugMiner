Tensorflow on android: directly build app in python?

The sample app given by google for tensorflow on android is written in C++.
I have a tensorflow application written in python. This application currently runs on desktop. I want to move the application to android platform. Can I use bazel to build the application that is written in python directly for android? Thanks.
