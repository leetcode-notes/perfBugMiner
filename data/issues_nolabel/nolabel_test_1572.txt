Fixing a python3 issue in bias_op_test.py

Issue 1: range in python3 does not return a list as in python2
Note that this PR doesn't fix all the currently failing Python3+GPU tests. It only gets the basic issues out of the way. Deeper issues related to dimension mismatches in bias_op_test, conv_op_test and pooling_op_test need to be addressed.
