Feature request: only master is allowed to export for `tf.contrib.learn.Experiment`

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac 10.11.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0-nightly, 1.3.0
Python version:  2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
When using tf.contrib.learn.Experiment for distributed training, it seems that all workers, ps, and master try to export model when finished. However, this will cause write conflict when model_dir is on hdfs, because all write the same file to the same location.
Hence, I propose that only master is allowed to export model.
I can work on it if tensorflowers're agreed.
