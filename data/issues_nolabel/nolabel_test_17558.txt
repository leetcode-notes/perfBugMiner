Timeline showing replicated processes

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6.0-rc1
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.1/7.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla k80 (11441MiB)
Exact command to reproduce:python cifar10_train.py

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I am running the standard CIPHAR example available in tensor-flow repository. I just added a few lines as suggested in this (#1824 (comment)) by @prb12. If I look at the timeline created for this:

I see two processes running exactly at the same time. Is this a bug in the timeline or am I missing something here ? The other explanation to me looks like these two processes are running simultaneously and sharing the GPU which according to my knowledge is non-trivial. If, these two processes are actually sharing the GPU is there some code or documentation to understand how its being done by tensor-flow ? Thanks a lot for any help
