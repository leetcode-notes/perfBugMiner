extra cpus not recognized when using docker on windows 10

Not sure if this is a windows 10 specific issue, a virtual box issue, a docker issue or a tensorflow/docker integration issue, but I'm getting
"tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'random_normal/stddev': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/cpu:1'"
For the following code:
with tf.device("/cpu:1"):
sess = tf.Session()
op = tf.matrix_inverse(tf.random_normal([100,100]))
sess.run(op)
Note that /proc/cpuinfo is reporting that I have cpu cores       : 8
Also, when I do run  tf.matrix_inverse(tf.random_normal([3000,3000])) my CPUs are barely used.
Another thing I tried was
"cat cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py | sed -e 's:gpu:cpu:g' > cifar10_multi_cpu_train.py"
python cifar10_multi_cpu_train.py --num_cpus=7
That didn't seem to work at all.
