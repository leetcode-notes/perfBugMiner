What have you tried?
1.I ran 'python -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional', and for the first time the model can print 'initialization' and train, but got stuck at the end. The second time I want to run it, it got stuck at the beginning after extracting from data. When I debug it, I find it's tf.Session() that making it get stuck.  When I tried '>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')  >>> sess = tf.Session()', it got stuck here.
2.I have run the NVIDIA_CUDA-7.5_Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery, and the result is PASS. I have even reinstall the cuda, but the result remain the same.
3.I have tried the CPU model, and it went just fine.
4.I tried to install from the source, the result remain the same.
Where is wrong? It seemed that the cuda and cudnn went wrong, but how to fix it?
Please help me!
