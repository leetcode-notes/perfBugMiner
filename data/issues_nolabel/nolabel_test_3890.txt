GPU Profiling: does the OP include the data transferring time from host to gpu device and gpu device to host?

Hi Paul,
I just do the profiling following: #1824. And it works quite well. I detect that Conv2D costs a lot of time in my case, and it is run by nvidia GPU, does the timing for Conv2D include the H2D/D2H time or just the time run on GPU.
Thanks!
