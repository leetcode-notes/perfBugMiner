Fix `TypeError: 'dict_keys'` in contrib.distribute with python 3

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #18205 where
TypeError: 'dict_keys' object does not support indexing

was thrown when using contrib.distribute in python 3.
The issue is that DistributedValues.devices returned self._index.keys() which is a dict_keys and is not a list in python 3.
This fix converts the dict_keys to list for python 3 to fix the issue.
This fix fixes #18205.
This fix als fixes #18188.
