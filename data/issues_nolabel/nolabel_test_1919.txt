Support for "Prod" on GPU

As brought up on so, Prod on GPU is only registered for float/double but not int inputs
This happens when computing gradient of network with tf.mean() because tf.gradients inserts a "Prod" node with integer inputs.
We already have support on GPU for Prod for float/double, could it be as simple as adding an extra registration clause to reduction_ops_prod.cc?
