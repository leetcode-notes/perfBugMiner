System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ArchLinux Latest
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9 /7
GPU model and memory: 2* Nvidia1080ti (11GB)
Exact command to reproduce:
run_options = tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()
training_loss_, _ = sess.run(op_list,
feed_dict=feed_dict,
options=run_options,run_metadata=run_metadata)
tl=timeline.Timeline(run_metadata.step_stats)
chrome_trace = tl.generate_chrome_trace_format()
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
f.write(chrome_trace)

Describe the problem
After switching to TF 1.4 compiled with CUDA 9 /CUDNN7 from TF 1.3 with CUDA 8 and CUDNN 6, chrome trace timeline stopped working, otherwise the code runs as before. See the attached screenshots (TF1.4 / TF1.3).
