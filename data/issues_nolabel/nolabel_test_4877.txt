fully_connected() doesn't reshape input

According to the docs,  if inputs' rank is >2 fully_connected() flattens it. However, running with inputs.shape = (None, m, n) I get:
ValueError: logits and targets must have the same shape ((?, m, 1) vs (?, 1))

And when I run with inputs.shape = (None, m*n) everything is fine.
On 0.11rc0.
