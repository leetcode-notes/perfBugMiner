PIP install OS X, requirement to install

Today I tried to install TensorFlow on my MacBook pro following the guidelines on tensorflow.org.
Operating System: OS X 10.11.6
Pip: 8.1.2 (python 3.5)
My MBP doesn't have an actual GPU so I tried using the CPU only version: link
When trying to run sudo -H pip3.5 install --upgrade $TG_BINARY_URL
Pip logged You must give at least one requirement to install (see "pip help install")
I'm pretty new to pip, is there something obvious that I'm missing ?
