tf.contrib.seq2seq Documentation

Where can I find documentation for tf.contrib.seq2seq?
I get a 404 error on [attention_decoder_fn.py].(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_decoder_fn.py)
Namely, I want to hack the attention_decoder_fn_inference or dynamic_rnn_decoder function during inference in order to sample the outputs of each cell based on output probabilities before feeding into the new cell. The aforementioned functions seem to be a black box that predict the most probable class at each cell.
Thanks
