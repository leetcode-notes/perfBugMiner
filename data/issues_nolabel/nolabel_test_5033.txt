Provide manylinux1 wheels on PyPI

Context: what is manylinux1 tag.
Currently, Tensorflow wheels on PyPI suck. As many know, we cannot upload specific Linux wheels on PyPI because the cheese shop prohibits different flavors (though Windows and macOS are OK). However, one can upload universal Linux wheels aka manylinux1 (see the link from above). There is a tool which helps making manylinux1 wheels called auditwheel.
auditwheel show tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl 

tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl is consistent with
the following platform tag: "manylinux1_x86_64".

The wheel references no external versioned symbols from system-
provided shared libraries.

The wheel requires no external shared libraries! :)

This basically means that we can execute auditwheel repair and obtain the manylinux1 wheel.
Thus I propose to upload CPU-only wheels for Linux for Python 2/3 to PyPI with manylinux1 tag.
