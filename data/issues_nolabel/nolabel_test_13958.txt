Upgrade gRPC

Update commit ID of grpc, update bazel.rc to force non-use of ares resolver, and also stop patching gRPC. This should enable regular updates of gRPC since separate patches will no longer be needed.
Some changes below will be brought in separately by another commit and should rebase out cleanly.
