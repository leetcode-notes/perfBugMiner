the new parameter in `print_tensors_in_checkpoint_file` breaks old code

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.6.0-0-gd2e24b6039 1.6.0

Describe the problem
The function print_tensors_in_checkpoint_file in tensorflow/python/tools/inspect_checkpoint.py is changed in this commit, a new parameter all_tensor_names is added.
This change breaks the old code using this function, including the examples in the Programmer's Guide.
I believe an elegant solution is setting the default value of the new parameter all_tensor_names to False
