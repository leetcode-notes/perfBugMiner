How to recompile eigen3 library

I changed some code in the //tensorflow/third_party/eigen3, and recompile the C++ sample (label_image). I looked at the code of the BUILD file in label_image and it depends on the //tensorflow/core, and I think the latter depends on the eigen3. However when I run the recompiled label_image, the code I've changed in eigen3 doesn't work. I am not very familiar with bazel so I hope someone can help me on this. How can I recompile the eigen3 to be reflected in the example?
