CIFAR-10 init routine breaks simple usages

This is partly breaking the CIFAR-10 example, and it doesn't make sense.
The files cifar10.py and cifar10_input_test.py already import cifar10_input, so the initialization doesn't seem to be needed at all.
If one tries to copy the code of cifar10.py and run it, it will break, since __init__.py imports cifar10, which defines the flags batch_size and data_dir, causing an error when your cifar10.py tries to redefine them.
To reproduce the problem, create a file exactly like cifar10.py and try to run it.
