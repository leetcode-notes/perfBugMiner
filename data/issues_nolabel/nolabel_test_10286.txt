OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64bits
Android Version: 7.1 (Nougat)
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
HEXAGON SDK: 3.1
nnlib source: https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/hexagon_nn/nnlib
Able to run runtime tf graph on hexagon but not able to run fused graph .
I got below error.

Where to get fused graph for inceptionv3q to run on hexagon?
what is the difference between TF runtime and TF fused graph(pointers? - operation wise)
