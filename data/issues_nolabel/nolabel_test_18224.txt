Added avro record dataset and avro record parse

** Added test cases
** Added examples
** Remove any tf. calls by directly calling the package function
** Integrate into tensorflow build by adding avro 1.7.7 to setup.py and various shell scripts
** Added readme file.
@skye Sorry, this took a bit longer. We got everything integrated into the dataset API. Please review; especially the setup of the dependencies: avro and compilation of avroc.
