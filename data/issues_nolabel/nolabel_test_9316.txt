MultiRNNcell expected state to tuple but its a tensor

i have define my lstm_cell as
def lstm(state, input_data, num_steps, hidden_size, num_layers, name):
# Input: (B, T, N)
with tf.variable_scope(name) as scope:
multi_lstm = MultiRNNCell([BasicLSTMCell(hidden_size)] * num_layers)
outputs = []
for t in range(num_steps):
output, state = multi_lstm(input_data[:, t, :], state)
output = batch_normalization(output, [0, 1], "batch")
outputs.append(output)
scope.reuse_variables()
return outputs
Now after defining my inputs for lstm_cell as
lstm_input = tf.reshape(c13, [B, M, -1])
lstm_state = tf.reduce_mean(lstm_input, [1])
and passing my values to lstm() , i am getting the following error
Expected state to be a tuple of length 6, but received: Tensor("Mean:0", shape=(25, 1568), dtype=float32)
