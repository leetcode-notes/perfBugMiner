Locate operations on parameter server

Hi,
I'm working on a distributed tensorflow, and I want to do some preprocess on the variables before the workers retrieve the variable. The preprocessing will trim the model and consequently reduce the amount of network traffic that transfer the variable from parameter server to workers.
Is that possible to put operations on parameter servers? Thank you
