Potential to add tf.image.rotate?

I experimented with the CIFAR10 example. I noticed that they have very good transformation functions. For example, flipping up down and left right. Would it be good if we add a rotate function? For example:
tf.image.rotate(image,angle)
where angle is the degrees to rotate by in the anti-clockwise direction.
