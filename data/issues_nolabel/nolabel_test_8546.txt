Fix several minor issues with C++ custom ops (`adding_an_op.md`) documentation

This fix tries to address several issues related to C++ custom ops (adding_an_op.md) documentation:

The tf.load_op_library('zero_out.so') should use full path or relative path (./)
This issue has been raised in #4727 as well.
The mentioning of zero_out_op_1.py and tf.load_op_library('zero_out_op_kernel_1.so')
is really misleading. While zero_out_op_1.py is located in  tensorflow/examples/adding_an_op/,
the documentation (adding_an_op.md) does not  really use zero_out_op_1.py.
It is better to use the zero_out.cc that is presented in the doc instead to avoid confusion.

This fix changes tf.load_op_library('zero_out.so') to tf.load_op_library('./zero_out.so')
and updates a few places so that following the documentation could have the expected result.
This fix fixes #4727.
