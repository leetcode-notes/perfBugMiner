Error Building from source with ARM processor gif_io/png_io errors

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
I'm following this guide for installing tensorflow on a raspberry pi, because it most closely resembles the environment that I am building on.
I noticed that there were a couple of things that had changed since those instructions were written, so if things had changed in the code when I checked them, I didn't follow those instructions for changing the code. (I don't think the error is because of these instructions, which is why I am posting here, instead of there).


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
I am building in a Debian Jessie environment, that I have built exclusively for the purposes of building tensorflow on ARM, with the latest versions of gcc/g++ that I could find.


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source


TensorFlow version (use command below):
I'm assuming the most recent, because I just cloned it yesterday.
The script errors because tf hasn't actually made it to the installation step.

Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Build label: 0.4.5- (@non-git)

Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Though, I've also gotten errors with


bazel build -c opt --copt="-mfpu=neon-vfpv4" --copt="-funsafe-math-optimizations" --copt="-ftree-vectorize" --copt="-fomit-frame-pointer" --local_resources 1024,1.0,1.0 --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

and
bazel build -c opt --copt="-mfpu=neon-vfpv4" --copt="-funsafe-math-optimizations" --copt="-ftree-vectorize" --copt="-fomit-frame-pointer" --local_resources 1024,1.0,1.0 --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I am getting the included error when I build tensorflow. I've gotten the same error with the png_io.cc file as well. I installed the libpng-dev library as was recommended here. Unlike in that example, that library did not exist on the computer I was installing it on (neither did libgif-dev, which was my guess for the gif library error). Is there a reason these libraries should be installed at the point that I run that command? Will I also need a libjpg-dev or something of the sort?
