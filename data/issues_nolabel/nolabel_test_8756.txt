Error installing from source

I'm trying to update tensorflow from the latest source. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04, with cuda 8.0 and cudnn 5.1.5. I was previously running r0.11 with no problem.
I pulled the new source. After running ./config and enabling cuda, I try to build with bazel:

bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

and I'm getting the following error:

ERROR: /home/jason/.cache/bazel/_bazel_jason/ba8a668adda8b53cb2de87e5e6b097b9/external/local_config_cuda/crosstool/BUILD:4:1: Traceback (most recent call last):

ERROR: Building with --config=cuda but TensorFlow is not configured to build with GPU support. Please re-run ./configure and enter 'Y' at the prompt to build with GPU support.
ERROR: no such target '@local_config_cuda//crosstool:toolchain': target 'toolchain' not declared in package 'crosstool' defined by /home/jason/.cache/bazel/_bazel_jason/ba8a668adda8b53cb2de87e5e6b097b9/external/local_config_cuda/crosstool/BUILD.

Note where it says "Please re-run ./configure and enter 'Y' at the prompt to build with GPU support." There is no such prompt when I run ./configure. I type 'Y' when it prompts if I want to build with cuda support and I give the correct cuda and cudnn versions and paths.
