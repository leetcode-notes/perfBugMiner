Fix Makefile to not use benchmark anymore (switch to minimal)

Minimal uses nothing and does almost nothing, but it does nothing
requiring protos or rest of tensorflow runtime.
Benchmark_model originally was more like this, but it became
useful for actually benchmarking, making it less useful as a minimal
example.
