Tensorflow hangs when initializing variables in a multi process setting

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Closest I found was #4767
But I don't intend to change the datatypes  of any variables...

But I have installed Tensorflow CPU only version in the virtualenv I am testing this code on, hence it might not be using CUDA at all as far as this issue is concerned (I am debugging an issue that occurred on a EC2 machine which has no GPU, by reproducing it in my local system)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:


A link to the pip package you installed: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl


The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".0.11.0rc2


If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I have saved a minimal working code which reproduces this issue at gist
To reproduce the issue:

Call saver.save in the main thread and checkpoint at least one tf.Variable
loading this checkpoint from main thread and evaluating the variable works fine
if I now launch a subprocess and try to load the checkpoint in that, Tensorflow hangs at sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried putting a container with names suffixed by the subprocess pid but it didn't help. I also tried a basic version of create_local_server and it didn't work too
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
I don't see any errors in the console when the code hangs.
