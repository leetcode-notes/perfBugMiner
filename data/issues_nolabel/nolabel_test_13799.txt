Feature Request: need to support dynamically RDMA gid setting in tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/verbs/rdma.cc

In tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/verbs/rdma.cc when calling  ibv_query_gid() the gid_index field is hard-coded as 0, which could not work well in real world.
To fix this, it is better to add a user-specified option.
