Failed to memcpy from device to host: CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT when running CIFAR10 after 113K steps

I tried to run the cifar10 model provided from TF with GPU support. I was able to successfully install Tensorflow from source (with GPU) and also was able to run the cifar10_train.py with utilizing my GPU. However, after step=113330, I encountered the following error which is probably related to async memcpy from device to host. As my graphic card compute capability is 5.2, I thought it should not be due to compute capability conflicts.
Similar issues
#1477
#1060
But my error is slightly different
