Android custom classifier importing error

Hi
I am having trouble importing a graph that I made in python into the Android demo app and running it. I built a CNN for character recognition. I am having problems finding the input and output nodes so I kept trying random logical combinations. Also I froze the graph and ran it through inference.
There seems to be no documentation at all for importing your own classifier into Android.
Both the data set and the ipython notebook are at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By50gGWStkpFZ1ZsajI0WHpFN0E?usp=sharing
In the ipython noteboook, the CNN at the bottom of the file is what I am trying to import to Android, the one with Dropout and MaxPooling.
