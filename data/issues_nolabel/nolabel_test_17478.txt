Update replicate_model_fn.py

Added a name attribute to _PerGraphState. Using the TowerOptimizer throws this warning without it:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing replicate_model_fn_graph_states.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
'_PerGraphState' object has no attribute 'name'
