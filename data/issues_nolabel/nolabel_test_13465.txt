This line doesn't effect in any cases.
The docker container for latest-py2 is working well even without this line.
Although it's written = 'python2', the docker container for latest-py3 is working.
parameterized_docker_build.sh or other scripts are not overwriting the line.
It should be removed, or overwritten when the images are built.
