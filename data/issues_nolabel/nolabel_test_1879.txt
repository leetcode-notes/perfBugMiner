Evaluate dev set in Translate.py: the decoder stills fetches from decoder_inputs, instead of previous predictions.

In the training process defined in Translate.py, the model is created with model = create_model(sess, False) where forward_only=False means every step of decoding the decoder would fetch from decoder_inputs, instead of previous prediction.
That's the same for evaluation of dev set, since the command
_, eval_loss, _ = model.step(sess, encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, target_weights, bucket_id, True)
with forward_only=True actually doesn't change the decoding way. (It just decides the backward.)
So I guess the evaluation of dev set is not a real evaluation? Or is it a trick? I guess the correct way should be creating a model with current checkpoint params and set forward_only=True.
Thanks.
