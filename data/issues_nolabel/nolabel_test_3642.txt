fix tanh inconsistent

#2234

use tag dispatching to dispatch complex number and non-complex number, because no max/min operator for complex number, if not use dispatching, build will fail
packetOp is inherited from scalar_tanh_op in eigen
complex number can't be packet, so just use numext::tanh(std::tanh) to compute
