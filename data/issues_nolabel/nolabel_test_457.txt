Wheel out of date

The wheel used for installing via pip for Tensorflow is out of date and is missing parts needed for the tutorials.
I've built from source successfully, but is very difficult to do on a machine that I don't have root access to. An updated wheel would make it much easier to do a user install of Tensorflow.
