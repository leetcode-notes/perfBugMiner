Add synthetic datasets fix

This fixes #5314 and #5315  that was reverted by #6288 by re-introducing a fix by @comicchang in  #6283 . Fix #6283 was not merged as it was submitted after #6288 reverted it.
The error was that import tensorflow as tf is not allowed (sorry didn't know that).
I think I checked everything, lgtm
