ValueError: All shapes must be fully defined.

Hi,
I am trying to create a TFRecord file where each picture is saved by its dimensions, label and image content.
Since every picture has different dimensions, so it is necessary to read the info from the file and reshape them. When I did something as the following:
features = tf.parse_single_example(
serialized_example,
dense_keys=['image_raw', 'label', 'height', 'width', 'depth'],
# Defaults are not specified since both keys are required.
dense_types=[tf.string, tf.int64, tf.int64, tf.int64, tf.int64])
image = tf.decode_raw(features['image_raw'], tf.uint8)
height = tf.cast(features['height'], tf.int32)
width = tf.cast(features['width'], tf.int32)
depth = tf.cast(features['depth'], tf.int32)
im_shape = tf.pack([height, width, depth])
new_image = tf.reshape(image, im_shape)
I got the error "ValueError: All shapes must be fully defined." Is this because I used the tensors representing dimensions instead of specific numbers? I have searched through the internet, all the tutorials and discussions are about reading fixed sized images. I do think reading various sized images is important. Any solutions to this issue? I would really appreciate it.
