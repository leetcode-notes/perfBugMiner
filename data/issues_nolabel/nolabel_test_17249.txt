TypeError: Failed to convert object of type <type 'list'> to Tensor.

I want to construct a dataset in which each element is a list of tensors with different shapes, because I need a dataset to contain my parsed image informations with different shapes. If I run the code like below:
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([[np.array([1]),np.array([1,2])],[np.array([2]), np.array([4, 5])]])
It reports TypeError: Failed to convert object of type <type 'list'> to Tensor.. How should I resolve this? Thanks!
