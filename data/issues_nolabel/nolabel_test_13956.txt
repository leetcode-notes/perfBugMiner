tf.contrib.layers.flatten has neither "name" nor "reuse" parameter.

I think tf.contrib.layers.flatten is just a special case of tf.reshape.
However, while tf.reshape has name parameter, tf.contrib.layers.flatten doesn't have one. Also neither of them has reuse parameter.
Is tf.contrib.layers.flatten a deprecated API?
