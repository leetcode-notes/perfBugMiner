Cannot opened include file "tensorflow/contrib/tpu/proto/tpu_embedding_config.pb.h": no such file or directory

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): current git master branch, should be v1.4.1 or v1.5.0rc1?
Python version: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): MSVC2015

GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: Trying a minimal build with cmake, with only snappy support and optimize for native arch turned on

Describe the problem
Build failing due to missing header files "tensorflow/contrib/tpu/proto/tpu_embedding_config.pb.h".
Everything build succesful except for tpu project. I don't really know how to generate the pb.h file from protoc manually. I trying to fix the problem by chaning .cmake files, but not sure which one is for tpu.
