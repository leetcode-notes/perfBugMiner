[Java] provide a Maven POM

It would be handy to have a POM file for the Java library.
In the short-term, having a POM facilitates local development of Java applications (potentially using other build frameworks).  For example, it makes it possible to install the built library into Maven's local repository:
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=bazel-bin/tensorflow/java/libtensorflow.jar \
  -DpomFile=tensorflow/java/pom.xml

The POM file should also be useful for eventual publishing of the library.
