Possible bug in    master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py

in rnn.py and the function def _rnn_step(...):
line 261: copy_cond = (time >= sequence_length)
sequence_length is a vector of ints and time is an int,  should time be compared with one element of sequence_length, instead of the whole thing?
(Is this function still work in progress?)
