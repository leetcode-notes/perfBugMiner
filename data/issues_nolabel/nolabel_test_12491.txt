AttributeError: 'int' object attribute '__doc__' is read-only

In the file tensorflow/compiler/tests/adagrad_test_poplar.runfiles/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/variable_scope.py", line 191, I have an error when trying to run unit tests.
Python is unhappy with trying to assign to doc.
This is on OS/X, with a virtualenv containing all of the modules required for the head of master on 22nd August 2017.
I have had to add autograd and enum, and as a consequence of the OS/X built-in numpy, I have switched to building tensorflow in a virtualenv.
