Notmnist lowmem

As explained in this Udacity thread and as requested by Vincent in Issue #936, I am issuing this PR to update the way the notMNIST dataset is loaded into memory, so that it requires less memory.
The idea is to load the dataset in pieces, curate each piece separately, and merge them.
