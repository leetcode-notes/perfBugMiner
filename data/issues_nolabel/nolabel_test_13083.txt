mismatch between the reported values of tt.nn.zero_fraction

Has anyone run into this issue before?
tt.nn.zero_fraction, defined in nn_imply.py reports my convs layers in MobileNet_v1 slim net have around 0.5 sparsity (conv1-conv13). However, when I freeze the model's weights and look at them, there is none zero values:
>>>conv=sess.run('MobilenetV1/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/weights/read:0')
>>>numpy.count_nonzero(conv)
5120
>>>numpy.count_nonzero(conv==0)
0


Looking at the histogram, there are many weights' values close to zero. Does that function do approximation? Can anyone verify this?
