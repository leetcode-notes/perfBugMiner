ksize in max_pool

I am trying to build a convolution (followed by max_pool) for variable length input size. Since the length of the input in a batch should be the same, I set the batch size to 1. However, for some reason ksize in tf.nn.max_pool is a list attribute required at run-time. This would prevent any neural network that uses variable input size to apply max pool. Is there a workaround for this? Should ksize be an input tensor otherwise?
