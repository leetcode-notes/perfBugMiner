pip install/upgrade version 0.7.1 issue -- ImportError: No module named protobuf

Had a previously working version of tensorflow 0.6
Executed single command which appeared to proceed without incident:
sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
However, now protobuf not found during python runtime though pip seems to have installed protobuf==3.0.0b2
Environment info
Operating System: Centos 7
