Failure to install from source

So, I have installed TensorFlow 0.10.0 using pip3. I have Python 3.5.2 GCC 5.4.0. And am running it on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (x64) with the following specifications:

CPU: Intel Core i5-6300HQ 2.3GHz-3.2GHz
RAM: 8GB DDR3 1600MHz
GPU: NVidia GeForce GTX 960M DDR5 4GB
1 TB Hybrid HD + 8GB Cache

When I'm trying to install tensorflow from source, i.e. git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow, cd tensorflow, and bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package. It gives me the following error:

Even if I use sudo, the same error arises. I want to use tensorflow with GPU enabled in my system. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!
