Possible bug in TensorFlowInferenceInterface

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0rc2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: Not using
GPU model and memory: Not using
Exact command to reproduce: Need to run tensorflow code in Android

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I was testing a trained my style transfer model on android. It uses depthwise separable convolution to decrease the size of neural network. When working on square images, it gives good results. But when I work with it on rectangular images, it gives weird results. Please see the result images attached. I highly doubt that this is due to my code because it is giving good results on all kinds of images on my laptop.
The style image was the famous painting 'la muse'

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
This is the code I used for running the network on android using TensorflowInferenceInterface
private void stylizeImage(final Bitmap bitmap) {
bitmap.getPixels(intValues, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());
for (int i = 0; i < intValues.length; ++i) {
  final int val = intValues[i];
  floatValues[i * 3] = ((val >> 16) & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
  floatValues[i * 3 + 1] = ((val >> 8) & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
  floatValues[i * 3 + 2] = (val & 0xFF) / 255.0f;
}

inferenceInterface.feed(
    INPUT_NODE, floatValues, 1, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), 3);

inferenceInterface.run(new String[] {OUTPUT_NODE}, false);
inferenceInterface.fetch(OUTPUT_NODE, outValues);

for (int i = 0; i < intValues.length; ++i) {
  intValues[i] =
      0xFF000000
          | ((outValues[i * 3]) << 16)
          | ((outValues[i * 3 + 1]) << 8)
          | (outValues[i * 3 + 2]);
}

bitmap.setPixels(intValues, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());

}
