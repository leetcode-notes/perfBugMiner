Pass through -fno-canonical-system-headers

This fixes the critical build issue #3743. After I figured out what was causing the issue, I couldn't really get a discussion of possible solutions going. I figured I would just go ahead and create a PR with the simplest and most immediate fix to get the ball rolling.
The fix is simple, gcc needs to be passed -fno-canonical-system-headers, and this PR makes it recognize this flag if it's passed to crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc and pass it along to the compiler command.
However, one could argue that there are more general and better solutions, such as passing through all -f... flags (there are actually currently many flags that are passed into the Python script that are not passed along). If anyone feels strongly about such an alternative solution, I would like to discuss the details of it before putting together a replacement PR.
I might need to rebase this build before it can be merged. I cloned an older commit since the master head is broken for me (#4312).
