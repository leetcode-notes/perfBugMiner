How to run a trained model of TensorFlow object detection in Java application with GPU support with boxes output (x, y, w, h)?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Linux Ubuntu 16.04/Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): No
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version:  3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA GTX 1080 8GB
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
Here I want to ask and sure that: Is this possible to run a trained model (using python to train) in a Java application with GPU support and detect the object and get the result of matches and the x, y point and the width and height?
I am going to use python to train my own dataset by using one of the model e.g: ssd_mobilenet_v1_cocoOR faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco and then use the trained model in the Java application with GPU support with boxes output. So I want to sure that does the TensorFlow support this task or not? If yes, is there any good tutorial to show the usage? If not, why, and when it can be supported?
Thanks in advance!!
