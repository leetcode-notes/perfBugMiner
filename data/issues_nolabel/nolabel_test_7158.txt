Documentation for Inference from saved model

As explained at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/pros/#build_a_multilayer_convolutional_network I created a CNN for MNIST image recognition. I don't want to test it in the same script so I trained the model, saved the checkpoint files and graph structure and then using freeze_graph.py script(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.py)  I froze it into single .pb file. Now using this .pb file I want to check the accuracy of the model but there is no clear documentation as to how to do it. There is one example written in examples/label_images directory but that too is in C++ and for inception network. I have already parsed the .pb file and made a tf.Graph object.
