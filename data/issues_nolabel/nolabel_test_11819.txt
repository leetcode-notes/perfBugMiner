Cmake support snappy

Windows CMake builds do not include SNAPPY compression library support, thus the resulting applications are not able to parse TensorFlow models that were compressed with SNAPPY.
This pull request adds SNAPPY as ExternalProject, just as it's done with all other 3rd party libraries.
Unfortunately I cannot verify this on a Linux machine right now, so option is disabled for Linux by default.
