[tf.data] Fix a device placement issue in `prefetch_to_device()`.

Previously, the iterator_get_device() op was being infeasibly colocated with
both the iterator and placed on the prefetch target device. Move the
construction of that op outside the with device(): block to fix this.
Also enable the relevant test to run as a CUDA test.
