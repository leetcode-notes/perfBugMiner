FCN Crop Layer

Hi all,
I am currently trying to implement FCN for semantic segmentation in TensorFlow as it was previously done in Caffe here https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org.
Unfortunately I'm struggling with following 3 things:

How to map Deconvolution layer from Caffe to TensorFlow? But I guess that I have found the solution in tf.nn.conv2d_transpose?
How to map Crop layer from Caffe to TensorFlow? Unfortunately I can't see any alternative in TensorFlow. Is there equivalent for this?
Does Caffe SoftmaxWithLoss correspond to TensorFlow softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits?

Thank you in advance for any advices, hints and help.
