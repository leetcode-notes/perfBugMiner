Added libcupti path to Linux GPU support documentation

Added path to libcupti in the documentation for enabling Linux GPU support.
Without this library being in LD path certain tutorials (e.g. https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/graph_viz/index.html) crash with message "tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:102] Couldn't open CUDA library libcupti.so."; if installed under these instructions and run under e.g. Jupyter.
