Fix the default value doc string of global_step in contrib.slim

This PR is to fix the default value doc string of global_step in contrib.slim.


As contrib.slim.learning.L428 shown, If global_step was left as _USE_GLOBAL_STEP, then tf.contrib.framework.global_step() is used instead of slim.variables.global_step() according to contrib.training.training.L386



As contrib.slim.learning.L657 shown, If global_step was left as None, then training_util.get_or_create_global_step() is used instead of slim.variables.get_or_create_global_step();
