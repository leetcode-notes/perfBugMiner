Error downloading jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz

I'm getting the following build error:
$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
ERROR:  tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config/BUILD:36:1: 
no such package '@jpeg_archive//': 
Error downloading from http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz

It turns out that bazel cannot download directly from the ijg.org in my network, due to security restrictions. However, I am able to download the file by hand.
I tried just putting it into the required .cache/bazel location by hand and run the bazel command again. This used to work, but it won't work in the latest version, and the same error comes up again.
Would it be possible to enable bazel to pick up a locally downloaded jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz file?
Or, if I don't work on JPEGs, how do I get rid of this dependency altogether?
