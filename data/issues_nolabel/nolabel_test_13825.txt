GRU cell implementation different from Reference paper "Cho 14"

Hello,
I've been looking through GRUCell implementation on Tensorflow at "tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py", and got a bit confused.
The output of GRUCell is implemented as
new_h = u * state + (1 - u) * c
However, from the reference paper "Cho 14" at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555.pdf
I think it should be like
new_h = (1 - u) * state + u * c
I am not sure if this is a bug or an intended variation from the reference.
Thank you
