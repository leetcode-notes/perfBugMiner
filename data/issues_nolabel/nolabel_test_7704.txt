Op type not registered 'TensorArrayV3'

I've been building graph in python and deploy to c++ since r0.10. After upgrading to r1.0, I've retrained the model, re-created the graph, and re-link the library all in r1.0. However, I got this error when try to use the graph in the c++:
Not found: Op type not registered 'TensorArrayV3'
Here is how I created the tensorflow shared lib:
cc_binary(
    name = "libtensorflow_all.so",
    linkshared = 1,
    deps = [
        "//tensorflow/cc:cc_ops",
        "//tensorflow/core:framework_internal",
        "//tensorflow/core:tensorflow",
    ],
)

I don't find TensorArrayV3 symbol in the official lib package either ( e.g: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-cpu-darwin-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz)
Can you please advise how to fix it?
