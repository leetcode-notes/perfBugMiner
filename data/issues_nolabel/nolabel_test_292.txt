Rank of Tensors

I think that there is an error in the description of the rank of the tensors.
In the example the tensor has  rank 3 i think but you wrote that it has rank 2.

Rank
In the TensorFlow system, tensors are described by a unit of dimensionality known as rank. Tensor rank is not the same as matrix rank. Tensor rank (sometimes referred to as order or degree or n-dimension) is the number of dimensions of the tensor. For example, the following tensor (defined as a Python list) has a rank of -------2-------------:
t = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
A rank two tensor is what we typically think of as a matrix, a rank one tensor is a vector. For a rank two tensor you can acccess any element with the syntax t[i, j]. For a rank three tensor you would need to address an element with 't[i, j, k]'.

let me know .
