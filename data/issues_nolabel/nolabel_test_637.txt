[Website] Download of Docker Images not possible

This is not related to the source code but to the website.
I'm not able to download any of the four Docker Images.
b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow: TensorFlow CPU binary image.
b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel: CPU Binary image plus source code.
b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu: TensorFlow GPU binary image.
b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-gpu: GPU Binary image plus source code.
Error Message:
"404. That’s an error.
The requested URL /tensorflow/tensorflow was not found on this server. That’s all we know."
