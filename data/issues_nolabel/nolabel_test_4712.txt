Add 3.7 to list of default compute capabilities

The Tesla K80 has a compute capabilities of 3.7. These are the cards in AWS' new p2 GPU offering and in Azure's GPU offering which means that usage of these cards will be quite widespread.
Given that there are some difference between CC 3.5 and 3.7, it would be ideal to have builds that are able to use the newer features / settings in 3.7.
