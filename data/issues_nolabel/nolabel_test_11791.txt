Feature request: equivalent of tf.nn.maxpooling_with_argmax for 3D maxpooling

It would be great to have the equivalent of tf.nn.maxpooling_with_argmax in 3D, in order to allow for 3D unpooling layers.
I am implementing a 3Dversion of the originally 2D Deconvolution network [Noh et al. 2015]. It has been implemented in 2D in Tensorflow here and in 3D in caffe here.
I need to use unpooling, and for that I need the indexes of the elements selected during pooling. This feature is implemented for 2D (tf.nn.maxpooling_with_argmax), but not for 3D.
