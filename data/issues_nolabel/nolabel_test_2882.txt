TensorFlow cannot detect my GPU

I have a Ubuntu 14.04.4 with Titan X, cuda 7.5 and cudnn v4
cuda 7.5 was installed by a run file, just like I used to installed Caffe.
Environment variables have been added to /etc/profile  and ~/.bashrc
A file named cuda.conf have been added to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
I installed TensorFlow via pip, using the following command:
$ sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
I followed the install instruction carefully, but I still met some issues.

It seems that TensorFlow cannot find my GPU.
I have no idea why these issues occur.
Please help, thanks
