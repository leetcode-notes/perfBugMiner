Problem with documentation regarding SparseTensors and TFRecord.

I can't seem to find how to store sparse tensors to TFRecord. GitHub issues is not really a place for such a question but documentation was really hard to understand. Could anybody help me with this? Maybe link to a code that uses VarLenFeature or something similiar?
