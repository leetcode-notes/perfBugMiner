TensorFlow r0.11 C impl protobuf package incompatible with Python 3.5

When building from source (master branch as r0.11 does not build; see #5578) bazel builds a protobuf python implementation.
$ python -c "from google.protobuf.internal import api_implementation; print(api_implementation._default_implementation_type)"
python

The C implementation referenced in the documentation is incompatible with Python 3.5 in Ubuntu 16.04:
$ pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/protobuf-3.0.0-cp3-none-linux_x86_64.whl
protobuf-3.0.0-cp3-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

Regression?? #3856
