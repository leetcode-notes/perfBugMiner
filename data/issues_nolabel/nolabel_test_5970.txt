[Windows] How to install cuDNN and enable GPU for Windows?

Operating System: Windows 10
Here is what I got when tried to import tensorflow (which is successful in itself):
`C:\Users\GoBack>python
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 11:41:13) [MSC v.1
900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.



import tensorflow as tf

It seems that the Cuda Toolkit can be installed properly, but cuDNN may not. Besides, I didn't see any instructions about this matter in the Tutorials or the Release notes.
Thanks a lot in advance!
