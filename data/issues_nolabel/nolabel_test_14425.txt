Support Windows builds through clang

Right now, the tested configurations for Linux, Mac and Windows use gcc, clang and MSVC, as seen at
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#tested_source_configurations
Linux can be made to compile with clang, too, if you use the right magic trick (--config=cuda_clang). All that's left is Windows, which is probably the trickiest of the three.
Bonus points for allowing to cross-build for Windows under Linux. The main problem there might be with CUDA and getting its SDK installed on a Linux system (just a wild guess).
