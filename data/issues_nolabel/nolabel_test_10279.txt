Windows GPU Nightly Build Failures

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Windows 10
With GPU

Describe the problem
The last stable nightly build for TF on Windows with GPU is currently # 149 and 1+ month old.
Is there a specific blocking issue, why a stable nightly build for this platform is not available for such an extended period?
Thanks for all the hard work!!! As always.
