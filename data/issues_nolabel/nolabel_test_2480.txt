Building TensorFlow with CMake

I realize that building TensorFlow from CMake is not yet ready for prime time, but I am attempting to push through some of the challenges and issues getting that working on a Mac.
Environment info
Operating System: Mac, OS X 10.11.5
Using CMake to create a make file (not interested in trying this with XCode yet)
Not currently using CUDA
Installed from sources, commit hash: 787b97e
Steps to reproduce
There are some issues with paths to eigen, json and re2 that I have been able to work around but I have run into a roadblock.
Several .cc files in tensorflow/core/framework/ directory attempt to include files that do not exist. The files to be included all end with ".pb_text.h". I assume that these files are (or should be) generated by the protocol buffer compiler.
For example, from tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc:
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value.pb_text.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.pb_text.h"

As a result I get "file not found" errors when building.
What have you tried?
There are some files in tensorflow/contrib/cmake/build/tensorflow/core/framework with similar names (like attr_value.pb.h and tensor.b.h) which I assume are generated by the protocol buffer compiler. I modified the .cc files which were causing trouble to include these files:
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value.pb.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.pb.h"

That results in errors related to using undeclared identifiers:
.../tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc:44:28: error: use of undeclared
identifier 'ProtoShortDebugString'
ProtoShortDebugString(tensor_proto), ">");
.../tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc:62:14: error: use of undeclared
identifier 'EnumName_DataType'
return EnumName_DataType(attr_value.type());
(and so on)
