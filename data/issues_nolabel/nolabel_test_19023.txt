Doesn`t work with Golang version until 1.7

System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow version: 1.7.0
TensorFlow installed from binary
Have I written custom code: not, thats because i can`t install the library
Bazel version: bazel is not installed
CUDA/cuDNN version: i have not CUDA/cuDNN
GPU model and memory: GPU - AMD MULLINS (DRM 2.50.0 / 4.13.0-37-generic, LLVM 5.0.0), RAM - 6.8 gb
Exact command to reproduce: go get github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go

Tthe problem
I installed TensorFlow as shown in the instruction, but with go get github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go failed:
# github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go
could not determine kind of name for C. CBytes

but it was only in Golang version below 1.7, BUT to use it I can't because I need another library gocv (and other binding OpenCV for Golang) work only in version 1.6.
Question
Is there any possibility to use TensorFlow with Golang 1.6?
P.S. env collect
