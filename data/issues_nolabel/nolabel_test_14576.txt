TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Installed from source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
TF-1.3.1
Python version:
Python 2.7.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Bazel - 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:

Describe the problem
This test passed successfully with CPU only. However its failing for GPU , getting following error :
F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session_with_tracking_alloc_test.cc:141] Check failed: cost_models.size() == 1 (2 vs. 1)
(Test expects cost_models.size() == '1' , but we are getting '2' with GPU)
I was looking into this test failure and I found some relevant discussion links -

lukeiwanski#75  - Here mentioned , this test is marked for no_gpu
lukeiwanski#115 - Here I found following comments:

The aim of this test is to ensure that there is at least one cost model (that of the CPU), as if there are no cost models then the test should fail and there is no point in trying to run the other tests on the cost
model.
The number of cost models provided by a session should matches the number of devices used by that session. When additional devices are present there will be more than one cost model, so we should not be checking for equality, but rather that the number of cost models is at least one.
As per above comments , I think we should raise a PR with following changes to pass on GPU as well -
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.3.1/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session_with_tracking_alloc_test.cc#L141
Original - CHECK_EQ(cost_models.size(), 1);
Updated to - CHECK_GE(cost_models.size(), 1);
Please provide your comments on this. Thanks!
