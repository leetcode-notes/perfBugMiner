pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-gpu

Following the installation guide at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
Installed:

CUDA (cuda_8.0.61_win10.exe)
cuDDN (cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v5.1.zip)
Python 3.6 x64 (python-3.6.0-amd64.exe)

Then issued:
C:>pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
Collecting tensorflow-gpu
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-gpu (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for tensorflow-gpu
Same happens with non-gpu version:
C:>pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
Collecting tensorflow
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: )

Just follow the provided instructions on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
First I tried 32-bit python but found on SO that is not supported (install guide should state which python is requrired 32 or 64)
I wanted specify the correct URL for tensorflow-gpu, but I don't know which is the correct one for r1.0 gpu. Like this (example):
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Please provide correct url - on storage.googleapis.com it is not possible to browse the directory contents. I need tensorflow r1.0 x64 gpu!
got the hint from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38896424/tensorflow-not-found-in-pip
