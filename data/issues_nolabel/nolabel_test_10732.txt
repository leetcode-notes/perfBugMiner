Padding queue support for tf.estimator generator input pipeline

So, as I desrcibe here, there is no padding possibilities in current estimator's input pipelines.
For now I added simple possibility to you data have dynamic shape over last axis.
If such solution looks good, then I am looking forward for next contributing steps.
