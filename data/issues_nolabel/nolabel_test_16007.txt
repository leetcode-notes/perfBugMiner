Fix inline if/else statement in CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS

An if/else statement was given inline as an argument to CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS for some CMake external projects as discussed in #15209. This resulted in the following init cache entries on some systems:
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE "ON;if(;tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE;);else;(;)"CACHE BOOL "Initial cache" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE "OFF;endif;(;)" CACHEBOOL "Initial cache" FORCE)

This commit changes the inline if/else arguments to -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=${tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE} which is functionality equivalent.
