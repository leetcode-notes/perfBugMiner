CUDA 7.0 is hard-coded in `configure` script for Linux

I am running Ubuntu 15.04 with CUDA 7.5 installed. However, CUDA 7.0 is hard-coded in the configure script, and I am unable to configure to use CUDA 7.5:
❯❯❯ ./configure
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GPU support? [y/n] y
GPU support will be enabled for TensorFlow

Please specify the location where CUDA 7.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Invalid path to CUDA 7.0 toolkit. /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.7.0 cannot be found

This is because CUDA 7.5's libraries have the .7.5 suffix rather than .7.0:
