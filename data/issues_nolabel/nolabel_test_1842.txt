Fixed a typo. It should be x (not b).

I think it's should be x, not b.
# 'perm' is more useful for n-dimensional tensors, for n > 2
# 'x' is   [[[1  2  3]
#            [4  5  6]]
#           [[7  8  9]
#            [10 11 12]]]
# Take the transpose of the matrices in dimension-0
tf.transpose(b, perm=[0, 2, 1]) ==> [[[1  4]
...
tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1]) ==> [[[1  4]
