CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED with TensorFlow example

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No, this error happens when using TensorFlow example "mnist_deep.py". Modified the file to go for 1.000 iterations instead of the default 20.000 because it took a long time to finish, everything else is the same.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-0-g9e76bf3 1.3.0
Python version: Python 3 (Though the issue persists with python 2.7)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): bazel-0.5.2-dist
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): GCC 5.4.0 20160609
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA: 8.0 cuDNN: 6.0
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA Tegra X2 8GB
Exact command to reproduce: python3 mnist_deep.py

I am using the Nvidia Jetson TX2 developer kit with Jetpack 3.1 (The architecture is aarch64). I have tried installing Tensorflow for Python 2 and 3, but the issue persists with both installations.
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I had no problems installing from source for either Python 2.7 and 3. When executing "mnist_deep.py" I get a CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED error. Since I had no problems during install, I believe there is something wrong with communication between Tensorflow and CUDA, which is why I'm posting here.
I had no problems excuting "mnist_softmax.py", and so the issue seem to be related to more sophisticated CNNs.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
