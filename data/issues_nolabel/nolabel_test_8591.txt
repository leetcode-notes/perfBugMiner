TensorBoard fails grouping summaries by names

Hi. Using Tensorboard, I found that it fails grouping scalar summaries by its name.
As I know, summaries are grouped by their name scopes, which are delimited by slash('/').
However, for some cases, the group to be bound together would be separated.
Here's a reproducible code that causes the same error, and the resulting tensorboard page.
import tensorflow as tf
import os

if not os.path.exists('./temp'):
    os.mkdir('./temp')
summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./temp', None)

summary = tf.Summary()
summary.value.add(tag='train/accuracy', simple_value=1.0)
summary.value.add(tag='train/cross_entropy', simple_value=1.0)
summary.value.add(tag='train/learning_rate', simple_value=1.0)
summary.value.add(tag='train_image/foo', simple_value=1.0)

for i in range(10):
    summary_writer.add_summary(summary, i)
summary_writer.flush()


Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: No cuda related, I guess.
TensorFlow version: Only confirmed in the nightly build, Linux-GPU version. But I think it will occur in other versions as well.
Thank you for your hard work. :^)
