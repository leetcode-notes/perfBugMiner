Android Example TF Detect crashes when built with files in source directory

Android TF Detect crashes when I make the apk with inception_5 and mobile_multibox files in the assets directory and removed in BUILD as per the instructions at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android
It works when built with automatic download.
I commented out lines 66 & 67 in BUILD.
"@inception5h//:model_files",
"@mobile_multibox//:model_files",
The file size of the apk built with the files added to assets manually is 4195 bytes smaller than the apk built with automatically downloaded files.
