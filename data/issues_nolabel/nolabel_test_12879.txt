Is it a bug of tf.map_fn?

Look at the code:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

elems = [tf.constant([1,2,3],dtype=tf.int64)]
alternates = tf.map_fn(lambda x: x, elems, dtype=tf.int64)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(alternates))
It will raise a error, but when I use tuple instead of list, it works well.
