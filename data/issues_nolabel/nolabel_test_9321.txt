Maximum points displaying on embedding

Hi,
I got a embedding file with 1.5 million points, its that possible to show all 1.5 million points instead of the first 100 thousand points only? I have been asking around Stackoverflow but no one can answer that question. Trying to check all those documentation but dosent help at all.
