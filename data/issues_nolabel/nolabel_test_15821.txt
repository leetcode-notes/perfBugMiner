TFGAN not compatible with eager execution mode

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colaboratory Google Compute Engine backend (not sure about OS here)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (non-GPU version)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0-dev20180102
Python version: 3

Describe the problem
When enabling eager execution mode
import tensorflow.contrib.eager as tfe
tfe.enable_eager_execution()
and running
noise_dims = 64
gan_model = tfgan.gan_model(
    generator_fn,
    discriminator_fn,
    real_data=images,
    generator_inputs=tf.random_normal([batch_size, noise_dims]))
from the TFGAN tutorial by @joel-shor, I get the following error:
ValueError: When Eager Execution is enabled, variable collections are not supported.
because of the following lines:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/train.py
    
    
        Lines 119 to 121
      in
      8c2d6fc
    
    
    
    

        
          
           # Get model-specific variables. 
        

        
          
           generator_variables = variables_lib.get_trainable_variables(gen_scope) 
        

        
          
           discriminator_variables = variables_lib.get_trainable_variables(dis_scope) 
        
    
  


.
Are there any plans to make TFGAN compatible with eager in the short term? Is there any help wanted in this regard? I'd be happy to contribute.
