Get "argv" error when trying to run mnist_softmax.py example

Hi,
I am trying to learn tensorflow from the tutorial on MNIST. I already have tensorflow installed on my system through conda and have been able to import tensorflow without any problems. Interaction with my GPU is fine when I ran code samples from research paper repositories.
To do so, I cloned the entire tensorflow repo into a local directory, and went into the tutorials/mnist directory. When I try to run the mnist_softmax.py example, I run into the error I have posted below.
$ python mnist_softmax.py
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so locally

Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'argv'
Searching stackoverflow, I haven't found much helpful posts on this subject. The two posts I found were http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40513466/tensorflow-retrain-py-app-run-got-unexpected-keyword-argument-argv and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40357548/inception-v3-guide-on-tensorflow-broken-for-c-and-python, but they are not really solutions to this problem.
So far I can't think of any reason why this would not work, except that maybe I need to compiler and build Tensorflow from source instead of just installing the binaries via conda.
If anyone could help with this, it would be really appreciated.
Thank you.
