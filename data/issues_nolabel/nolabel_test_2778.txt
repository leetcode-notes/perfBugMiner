Isn't current tensorflow-git r0.9?

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
cuda 7.5
cudnn 5.0.5
Build from source, tensorflow-git-master
Just use bazel to build tensorflow, which built out a version 0.8.0, instead of 0.9.0 ....
Shouldn't current git master build out 0.9.0, instead of 0.8.0?
Cheers
Pei
