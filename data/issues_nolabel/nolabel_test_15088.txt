Make a State-ful LSTM with data input from TF Dataset

#14906
This is to reference a closed issue.
Thanks for @mrry suggestion on using Dataset.flat_map to slice the input signal sequence.
However, how could we know the beginning and ending of the original sequence after sliced?
And how could we reset the LSTM state so that we can make a state-ful LSTM?
Thanks!
