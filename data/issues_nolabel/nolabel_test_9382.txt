Tensorboard not (correctly) displaying histograms; unreliably displaying graphs (V1.1rc2,win7,chrome57)

When I went from tensorflow V1.0 to V1.1rc2, histograms stopped working correctly: the data isn't drawn unless that trace is highlighted via mouseover, and even then it's not using the right plot boundaries:

is an example (cursor is not displayed but is at the dot in top left of graph; otherwise graph is blank) generated from this code:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

xx = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([4,4], dtype=np.float32),dtype=tf.float32)
yy = tf.Variable(np.eye(4, dtype=np.float32), dtype=tf.float32)
zz = tf.matmul(xx, yy)
save_location = 'g:\\tmp\\lstm3\\dbg\\dbg'
tf.summary.histogram('tensorboard_no_like', zz)
merged = tf.summary.merge_all()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
train_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(save_location, sess.graph)
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer())
qwert = zz.eval()
m = sess.run(merged)
train_writer.add_summary(m)


I haven't tried this toy repro with v1.0, but other models that I've done in 1.0 and 1.1rc2 exhibit the same behavior. The distributions look fine, and scalars also display fine.
Another problem that's new to me between 1.0 and 1.1rc2 is that graphs sometimes display fine, sometimes are blank until I reload browser page a few times. (Apologies if this should have been a separate issue; wanted to keep spam volume down). I don't have a strong idea of what triggers this, but the frequency is pretty high, roughly half the time.
the console running tensorboard emits the following warning periodically, the timing of which I haven't correlated with either problem mentioned above:

WARNING:tensorflow:path ../external\data/plugin/text/runs not found, sending 404
