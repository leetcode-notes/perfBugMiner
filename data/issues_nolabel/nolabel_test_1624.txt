Delete tf.reduce_mean on scalar

Remove tf.reduce_mean() from tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.l2_loss()) in tensorflow/tools/docker/notebooks/2_getting_started.ipynb
According to reference, tf.nn.l2_loss() always returns a scalar, thus no
need to average it.
At last code block where loss function is re-implemented by hand,there is
no mean() operation.
Excuse me if something is wrong, have little to no exp. in python and tensorflow.
