Tensorflow Usage with the C++ API, not working

I am trying to go through the tutorial that provided on the TensorFlow website (LINK).
Im in Usage with the C++ API part. It says:
You can download the archive containing the GraphDef that defines the model like this (running from the root directory of the TensorFlow repository):
and then it provide the following command:
curl -L "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_v3_2016_08_28_frozen.pb.tar.gz" |
  tar -C tensorflow/examples/label_image/data -xz

I tried to run this command in my linux terminal but it is givving me error.
Can you tell me how and where I should run this command?
Thanks
