Add parameter to monitors to allow execution every_n_epochs

Many of the Monitors used for monitoring the training with an Estimator allow to specify the number of training steps after which they will be executed. Additionally it would be nice to be able to specify the number of epochs after which the monitor should be executed. This would make it very easy to validate the training after all training data has been learned for example one (or two...) more times.
From looking at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/monitors.py, I saw that all the monitors allowing to specify the every_n_steps parameter are extending the EveryN class. In order to also allow a parameter like every_n_epochs, this class could be extended to count the number of epochs by listening to the def epoch_begin(self, epoch) method.
