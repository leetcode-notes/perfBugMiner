Concatenate in alternate fashion two tensors

Good Afternoon.
I'd like to concatenate two tensors of shape (None,16) in alternate fashion.
For example, with simple arrays, if the inputs are:
a=[[1,2,3],[1,2,3],...]
b=[[4,5,6],[4,5,6],...]
I want this output:
c=[[1,4,2,5,3,6],[1,4,2,5,3,6],...]
How can I do it?
I can't loop on tensors because of unknown shape[0], zip function isn't supported for tensors (tensor object is not iterable).
Thank u all in advance
