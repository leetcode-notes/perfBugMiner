Fixes #15736

This will allow users to import keras submodules without typing from tensorflow.python.keras... but just directly from tensorflow.keras.
This change also does not create a duplicate of the module object but just assign it two names, one with tensorflow.python.keras keeping current functionality and tensorflow.keras allowing a much more consistent API use.
With this change the user is able to import keras objects directly, for example
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
