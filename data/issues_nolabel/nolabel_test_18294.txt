Issue using/importing unsorted_segment_mean

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Win 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install ( and reinstalled after the first errors)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7
Python version: 3.5.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
GPU model and memory:N/A
Exact command to reproduce: test = tensorflow.unsorted_segment_mean

Describe the problem
I cannot import the or use the function unsorted_segment_mean despite it being present in python/ops/math_ops and exported with tf_export, but I am able to use unsorted_segment_sum.
My IDE shows me the function but when trying to call it I get AttributeError.
I have tried to import it directly using
import tensorflow.unsorted_segment_mean
And this failed too.
I have tried to import permutations of the path (ops, math_ops, ops.math_ops, etc) to try to access is directly and I got error that tensorflow did not have those modules (despite my IDE stating the opposite). And I could not access it that way either.
