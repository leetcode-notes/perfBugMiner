zlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing: invalid block type

I used pip to install Tensorflow . I ran the commands provided in the link https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#common-problems
The commands i Ran were :
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Tensorflow got installed properly and a folder was created in the usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages folder.
I tried to create a model using the mnist  dataset and ran the following command in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/models/image/mnist folder
python convolution.py
The following message was displayed in the console :
Successfully downloaded train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz 9912422 bytes.
Successfully downloaded train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz 28881 bytes.
Successfully downloaded t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz 1648877 bytes.

zlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing: invalid block type
I removed the mnist data files present in the data folder and then again executed the python command  : python convolution.py , Now surprisingly it is giving a bit different error as :
zlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing: invalid stored block lengths .
I am using python2.7 running inside Ubuntu 14.04 Operating system .
