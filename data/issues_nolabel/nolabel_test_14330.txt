Add `decode_libsvm` for libsvm format support

This fix is an effort to add libsvm format support with the implementation of decode_libsvm, as was proposed in #14313.
The implementation is done in contrib with, e.g.,
label, feature = tf.contrib.libsvm.decode_libsvm(input, num_features=6)

where the input is a string tensor and the output is a tuple of label and feature.
The label tensor is the same shape as input. The feature tensor is of the shape [input_shape, num_features].
This fix fixes #14313.
