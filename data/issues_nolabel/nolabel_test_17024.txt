Script train_image_classifier.py has no option use_nesterov in the MomentumOptimizer

Have I written custom code: No
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from: Pip
TensorFlow version: 1.4.0
Bazel version: N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0.61, CUDNN v6
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80
Exact command to reproduce: N/A
In Tensorflow, the MomentumOptimizer has use_nesterov disabled by default. In the generic classifier training script - train_image_classifier.py - the flags do not have use_nesterov option (see here and here), which makes it real easy to miss the fact that it is not being used. I think an additional flag should be introduced in the optimizer section of train_image_classifier.py.
P.S. Why was the decision taken to disable use_nesterov? I tried searching online if there were any disadvantages associated with Nesterov momentum but did not come up with much. The paper referenced in Tensorflow documentation only encourages the use of Nesterov momentum versus classical momentum. Am I missing something?
