Added "hop_bytes" option to FixedLengthRecordReader

A "hop_bytes" option added to FixedLengthRecordReader.
With this option, one can easily read fixed-length record from file with a sliding window. This is useful for reading audio waveform or features with contexts.
Example:
file:
"1234567"
reader:
record_bytes=3, hop_bytes=2
result:
"123", "345", "567"
