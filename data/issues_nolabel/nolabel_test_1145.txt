Specify --no-install-recommends in apt-get install in Dockerfiles

Explicitly list needed packaged in Dockerfile and then add --no-install-recommends so that unneeded packaged are not added. For example right now install OpenJDK tried to install fuse.

unzip needs to be added to the list of packages to install.
