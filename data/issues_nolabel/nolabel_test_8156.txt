Add CI build for XLA

There's no continuous testing for XLA build, so that head can contain errors.
Right now it's broken with syntax error, and this error has been there since Mar 2 or earlier -- #8039
XLA got a lot of publicity at the TF summit, and there've been 90 issues filed on it, 5 of them connected to this breakage. Keeping head free of build errors for XLA build could ease the support burden on this list. @caisq @jhseu
