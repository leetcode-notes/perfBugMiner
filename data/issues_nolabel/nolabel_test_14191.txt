tf.nn.l2_normalize takes dim instead of axis

At master, tf.nn.l2_normalize still takes the axis parameter as dim.  Everything else has been standardized on axis, so it'd be nice if this one was axis too.  Since dim can't be changed for backwards compatibility reasons, presumably the right approach is adding an extra axis argument and requiring that at most one of them is set.
@aselle: Is that right?
