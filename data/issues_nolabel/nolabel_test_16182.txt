What are the relation ship between TF.Slim, TF high level API and Keras

I am very confused. What are the relationships between TF.Slim, TF high level API and Keras. I just want to know which one has the long term evolution. Fragmentation, like Android OS, is a very bad and dangerous thing. At least for me, I am not comfortable with TF.Slim at all. Why TF cannot have a unified and Standardized API? The benefits are so obvious. It should not become different political parties fight each other.
