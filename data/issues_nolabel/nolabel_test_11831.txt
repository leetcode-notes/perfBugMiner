No mention of how to use custom RunConfig with Estimator in the Estimator tutorial

On the tutorial of creating estimators using tf.contrib.learn there doesn't seem to be any mention of how to create your own RunConfig object in order to specify the configurations for an Estimator run. The configuration in particular I wanted to find was on how to write summaries after custom sized steps. I eventually found it in the RunConfig description, but I think it would be worthwhile to mention it in the tutorial.
Link to the tutorial:

Link to the RunConfig description:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/RunConfig
I was wondering if the tutorial could be updated to show how to create your own RunConfig object and use it with the Estimator.
