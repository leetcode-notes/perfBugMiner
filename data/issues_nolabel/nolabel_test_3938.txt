After upgrade protobuf for the 64Mb limited , segment fault occurred

After doing "pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/protobuf-3.0.0b2.post2-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl" as said in "https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html#protobuf-library-related-issues"
, my tensorflow did not work and got a segment fault after import tensorflow.
Could some one give me a right pip install version of >64MB limited protobuf?Thanks!
