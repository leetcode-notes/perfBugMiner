skip some single example when reading tfrecords

I have created several tfrecords files that containing images, labels, or other information.
When reading tfrecords, can I skip some samples according to the information after tf.parse_single_example. For example, I want to select those samples with certain labels or those sample with the image size larger than the threshold.
I don't know how to do it in the current version. I hope you will support this feature in the future.
