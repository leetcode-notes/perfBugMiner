NULL for interpreter->typed_tensor<uint8_t>(input)

Hi there, for my iOS app i'm using tensorflow-lite,
I'm facing this issue after initializing the interpreter
In,
int input =interpreter->inputs()[0];
uint8_t *input_index = interpreter->typed_tensor<uint8_t>(input);
input_index = NULL and input = 27
May I know what is input and what are the possibilities that input_index will be NULL
