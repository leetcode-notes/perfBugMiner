Extend SVD gradient to support backpropagating through complex and (strongly) rectangular U and V

This initial version of SVD gradients has the following restrictions:
Only supports statically known inner matrix dimensions m and n.
Backpropagating through U and V (i.e. backpropagating through SVD nodes with compute_uv=True) has further restrictions:
a) Only supports real tensors.
b) Only supports square and "almost square" matrices where the number of rows and columns differ by at most 1.
c) full_matrices must be true also. This does not currently have severe implications, given the restriction in b).
Support for dynamic shapes and a) (I think) is straightforward to fix.  But b) is probably a deeper issue having to do with the (lack of) uniqueness of the decomposition, and will require some analysis. I think that if we understand b), we can get around the restriction in c) as well.
I'm marking this as contributions welcome, in the hope that somebody with better math skills than myself will help out :-)
