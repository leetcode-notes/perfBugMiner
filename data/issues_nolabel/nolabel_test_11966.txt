[XLA] Add a scheme for disabling tests based on type support by backends

This change allows CPP tests to be marked as requiring certain type support.  As it stands, I have updated only the scalar math test with the annotations.  I will do the rest once this change is debated.
The plugin config has something like this added to the 'copts' option:
    "copts": [
      "-DXLA_TEST_DISABLE_F64",
    ],
