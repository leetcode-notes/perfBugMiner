The sample code on PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE has a problem

Hello,
There is a problem on the PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE.
https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables#sharing_variables
In the second code snippet of the chapter "Sharing variables"
input1 = tf.random_normal([1,10,10,32])
input2 = tf.random_normal([1,20,20,32])
x = conv_relu(input1, kernel_shape=[5, 5, 1, 32], bias_shape=[32])
x = conv_relu(x, kernel_shape=[5, 5, 32, 32], bias_shape = [32])  # This fails.
Problem
The shape doesn't match.
Solution
Change the third line to
x = conv_relu(input1, kernel_shape=[5, 5, 32, 32], bias_shape=[32])
And the code after this also have the problem.
