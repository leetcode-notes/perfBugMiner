TF learn has a problem with discontinuous categorical outputs

I have a train.csv which looks like:
v1,v2,v3
5,4,10
1,2,5
4,5,20
1,11,50
1,12,20

and test.csv:
v1,v2
4,5
2,3
2,4
5,6

The idea is: the output variable (v3) can take four values:  5,10,20,50 and nothing more. It is classification task.
Then code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.contrib import learn

print ("Reading data")

df_train = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
df_test = pd.read_csv("test.csv")

print ("Dividing to train and test set")

y_train = df_train ['v3']
X_train = df_train [['v1','v2']]

X_test = df_test[['v1','v2']]

classifier_1 = learn.TensorFlowDNNClassifier(
     hidden_units=[20, 10], 
     n_classes=4, 
     batch_size=128, 
     steps=500, 
     learning_rate=0.05)

# fit
print ("Fitting")
classifier_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
Then I have a problem:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sample.py", line 26, in <module>
    classifier_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
  File "/Users/qdang/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/base.py", line 254, in fit
    feed_params_fn=self._data_feeder.get_feed_params)
  File "/Users/qdang/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/trainer.py", line 49, in train
    feed_dict = feed_dict_fn()
  File "/Users/qdang/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/io/data_feeder.py", line 281, in _feed_dict_fn
    out.itemset((i, self.y[sample]), 1.0)
IndexError: index 5 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 4

I think the issue is because the absolute value of output value (5) is larger than the number of classes (4)
