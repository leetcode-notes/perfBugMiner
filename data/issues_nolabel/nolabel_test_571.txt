Saver / tf.train.latest_checkpoint doesn't work very well with relative paths

For example, if model is saved into a folder test by doing saver.save(session, '/path/to/test') - will result in the having checkpoints and model-0 files. Where checkpoints file will have something like this:
model_checkpoint_path: "test/model-0"
all_model_checkpoint_paths: "test/model-0"

Which if you call now tf.train.latest_checkpoint('test') from the same directory, will result in the None.
This is due to os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, ckpt.model_checkpoint_path) which for relative path like above will result in the test/test/model-0.
