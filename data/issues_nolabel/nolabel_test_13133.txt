Session.run with fetches = list apparently works incorrectly

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): The problem manifests in a standard tutorial and I wrote custom code to better understand it.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee', '1.3.0')
Python version: Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: no GPU
GPU model and memory: none

Describe the problem
The TensorFlow Mechanics 101 tutorial code outputs value of the same Op, loss, in two ways: summary and console output.  The two values do not match.
The code is located here.
To make the problem clear, I changed the console output format on line 305 to 8 decimals:
  cat(sprintf('Step %d: loss = %.8f (%.3f sec)\n',

I compared the console output for loss with the results of the summary Op (the op is defined on lines 120 and 262, and run on line 308).  I obtained the results of the summary op from the csv file downloaded from tensorboard.
The console output is close to the csv file but different, often in the third decimal; they should be identical since the op is the same on the same step.
I do not copy the output here since it is unstable, changes from one run to another.  (I have not been able to stabilize it with use_session_with_seed or with tf$set_random_seed.)
I changed lines 297-298 from
values <- sess$run(list(train_op, loss), feed_dict = feed_dict)
loss_value <- values[[2]]

to a supposedly equivalent code:
sess$run(train_op, feed_dict = feed_dict)
loss_value = sess$run(loss, feed_dict = feed_dict)

After that the console output agreed fully with summary data obtained from csv.
I take it that sess$run(list(... works incorrectly.
I do not know whether the problem is in TensorFlow or in the R interface to it.
