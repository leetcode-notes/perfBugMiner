Not able to run tensorflow with OpenBLAS support

Hi,
Im trying to use OpenBLAS for gemm operations instead of EIGEN with tensorflow.
I have followed the steps given in
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/TopicUsingBlasLapack.html
and compiled the tensoflow android demo application with -DEIGEN_USE_BLAS support and have linked the libopenblas.a to EIGEN by placing the OpenBLAS headers and static library in eigen_archive along with BUILD file.
The BUILD File of OpenBLAS is as follows:
licenses(["notice"])
cc_library(
name = "openblas",
hdrs = glob(["include/*.h"]),
srcs = ["lib/libopenblas.a"],
visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
The BUILD file of EIGEN has been appended to include and link the openblas library as follows:
cc_library(
name = "eigen",
hdrs = EIGEN_MPL2_HEADER_FILES,
defines = [
# This define (mostly) guarantees we don't link any problematic
# code. We use it, but we do not rely on it, as evidenced above.
"EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY",
],
includes = ["."],
copts = ["-IOpenBLAS/include"],
deps = ["//OpenBLAS:openblas"],
visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
The build is given as follows:
bazel build --copt=-DEIGEN_USE_BLAS --fat_apk_cpu=arm64-v8a //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo --verbose_failures
The Build is completed successfully and im able to run the apks installed on the target. But the print statements which i have put in OpenBLAS and Eigen/src/Core/products/GeneralMatrixMatrix_BLAS.h using android logging LOGI or LOGD doesnt get displayed in logcat of the device.
The Build fails if i dont link the openblas library in EIGEN BUILD file and use  -DEIGEN_USE_BLAS, which shows that libopenblas is getting linked to EIGEN.
Can you please suggest what is the problem in the above procedure ?
How can we validate OpenBLAS is actually getting used?
