Prediction based on day / time with tensorFlow

I did some digging but I couldn't find anything (maybe i just didn't know what do search exactly),
I'm in my final year of study and I am starting my final year project in Software engineering,
My plain is to (lets take smart house as an example) create a machine that will learn the householders habits and then do that action based on what they did (e.g: at Sunday, 7 AM turn on the boiler for 30 minutes because only one resident need to take a shower).
Can TensorFlow learn and act like that?
Please help.
Thanks.
