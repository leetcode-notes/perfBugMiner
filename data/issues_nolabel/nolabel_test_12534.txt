Describe the problem
This is a bug related to the CMake build of TensorFlow which fails on my system due to an error with the nsync build. The nsync build seems to not include some headers (see below). I have tested with TensorFlow v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.2.0 and the current master branch. I have not been able to investigate the nsync error because a standalone nsync build (i.e. clone->cmake->make) fails at an earlier step (/Users/kasper/Development/nsync/platform/macos/platform.h:35:13: error: typedef redefinition with different types ('int' vs 'enum clockid_t') typedef int clockid_t;). Unfortunately, I have not been able to submit an issue to https://github.com/google/nsync and resolve this problem because issues are disabled for this repository.
