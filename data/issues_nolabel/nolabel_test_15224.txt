Add TensorFlow support for tf.repeat (equivalent to np.repeat)

This fix tries to address the feature request proposed in #8246 where there was no equivalent of numpy.repeat in TensorFlow.
This fix adds the support for tf.repeat that is equivalent to np.repeat.
NOTE: in order to allow optional axis parameter, this fix adds Repeat and RepeatFlat  ops where one takes axis and another does not take axis.
This fix fixes #8246.
