Inception3 retraining - attach text/labels to individual images

Hi
I am using the inception v3 model to retrain my own dataset. I have few folder which represent the classes which contain images for each class. What i would like to do is to 'attach' some text ids to these images so when they are retrained and used to run classification/similarity-detection those ids are retrieved too. (basically its image similarity detection)
For instance, Image X is of class 'Teachers' and it belongs to John. When i retrain the model, and run a classification on the new model, i would like to get the Teachers class, but in addition to this i would like to know who is teacher (John).
Any ideas how to go for it?
Regards
