Update contrib/HVX readme

I updated the README because of some imprecisions and to add clarifications of what I think will guide the users more appropriately.
First, the very simple "quick start guide" doesn't work, there's no "-X" option (at least publicly) and so you always need to have the SDK installed manually.
Apart from that, some clarifications and rewording were done to help the users understand what's happening.
