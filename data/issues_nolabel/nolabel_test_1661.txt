conv4d and higher dimension generalization

Are there some plans to include a 4D (and possibly higher dimension generalization) convolution op? Would be nice for doing 3D + time processing for example (for the 4D version).
Also, should something be done to offer the user the possibility to choose the shape of the kernel? For example allowing both the natural hyper cube kernel nodes location or a hyper thetrahedron location? Could have consequences on the computing power requested:
