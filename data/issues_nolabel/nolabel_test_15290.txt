Feature request: provide a means to configure, build, and install that includes cc

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Both Mac and Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4
Python version: 3.6.3, but not relevant
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.8.1, but not relevant
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Both GCC and clang, but not relevant
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Tensorflow doesn't seem to have a clean way to install from sources to support both python and C++ development. When we install from sources, only the core tensorflow framework is installed in the python site-packages directory. The cc headers (and maybe others) are not included. Likewise the libtensorflow_cc.so is not built. It's surprising that there is so little documentation for how C++ developers are expected to develop tensorflow applications. My use case is probably common: I want to train and test my model using python, but I want to deploy an application that does prediction/inference with the app written in C++.
I have managed once to successfully install the headers and libraries I need into /usr/local/... on a Mac, but in doing so I lost some of the CPU optimizations that I had specified when doing the standard build from sources. Now I need to repeat this process on Linux, where I need GPU support, and want to make sure I get it right.
It would be so nice if there was something close to the standard ./configure; make; make install that could install headers and libraries into a chosen directory.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
