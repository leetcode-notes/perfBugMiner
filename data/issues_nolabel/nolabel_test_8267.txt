TypeError: Expected int32, got list containing Tensors of type '_Message' instead.

I am using tensorflow (1.0.0) in Ubuntu 14.04. When I train a cnn model ,I got a error as follow:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:44: DeprecationWarning: This module was deprecated in version 0.18 in favor of the model_selection module into which all the refactored classes and functions are moved. Also note that the interface of the new CV iterators are different from that of this module. This module will be removed in 0.20.
"This module will be removed in 0.20.", DeprecationWarning)

How can I resolve this question?
