Issue with tensor flow (undefined symbol: cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain)

When I try to import tensorflow in python I get this issue:
Note: It was working fine yesterday.  It is really strange that today it no longer works.
Also note: This is my first time to ever post a question online, as I prefer to find answers to my own problems.  The issue here is that there is no documentation on this problem online and I am hitting a wall on ideas for once for how to resolve it.  I am using TF without gpu support, but am hopeful the capable team on this git can at least tell me if the problem on my end or not.  I realize it is likely something on my end, but a response to verify that would be helpful, even if the problem is perceived as too simple to bother with.
