scatter_add for non variable tensors

Hi,
I am interested in using scatter_add when the tensor being update is not a variable. Is this possible?
I am looking to do something like this:
X1_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 3))
ind_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None))
#Z = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10, 3]))
Z = tf.zeros([10, N_feat])
X1 = np.array([[1,0.00,1],
[2,0.00,1],
[3,0.00,1],
[5,0.00,1.1],
[6,1.0,1.8]])
ind = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Z = tf.scatter_add(Z, ind_ph, X1)
If I declare Z as a tf.Variable, I can do this, but I need to call this operation hundreds of thousands of times, and do not want to store any copies of Z once I am done with them. If I were to declare Z as a Variable, would there be any way to destroy Z once I am done with it (maybe with a garbage collector or something similar)? Thank you so much for your help!
