Gradients error when using while_loop: "ValueError: None values not supported"

Working on Tensorflow version 0.10, I am getting the following error when using tf.gradients:
.../python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/gradients.py", line 478, in gradients
...
.../python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py", line 346, in make_tensor_proto
    raise ValueError("None values not supported.")

The error occurs due to the use of the function tf.while_loop . When I turn off its use, the gradients are calculated with no error.
A similar issue was related to in #783, but I can't fix the error using the suggested solutions.
