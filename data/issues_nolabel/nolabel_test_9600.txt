Why the basic function of different rnn cells are different?

I'd like to tackle two issues. The first one is about the initializer. I can define initializer in LSTMCell but not in GRU cell. The second one is layer_normalization. There is LayerNormBasicLSTMCell available for using layer normalization on LSTM cell. But there is not other kinds of cell used in that way. I wonder why not make this general functions available for all kinds of cells?
