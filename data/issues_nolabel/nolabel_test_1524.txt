Can tensorflow support slicing tensor every N element

Slicing an array every N elements is a basic function of numpy or python list. However, I found that tensorflow doesn't support it. For example,
a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(3,100))
b = a[:,::4]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev_4.3.0.201508182223/pysrc/pydevd_exec.py", line 3, in Exec

"Steps other than 1 are not currently supported")
NotImplementedError: Steps other than 1 are not currently supported
I wonder that how can we use slicing on tensor to select every N elements (rows or lines)?
Best wishes
