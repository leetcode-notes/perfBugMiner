Running Tests in Docker (on Mac) Fails with Cryptic Download Error

I am currently trying to run the Docker tests on my machine (a Mac).
Building the container succeeds, but then when it builds TensorFlow after ./configure, it fails with the following error:
ERROR: /workspace/tensorflow/tensorboard/bower/BUILD:5:1: no such package '@numericjs_numeric_min_js//file': Error downloading [https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/numeric/1.2.6/numeric.min.js] to /Users/gibiansky/tensorflow/bazel-ci_build-cache/.cache/bazel/_bazel_gibiansky/eab0d61a99b6696edb3d2aff87b585e8/external/numericjs_numeric_min_js/numeric.min.js: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: timestamp check failed and referenced by '//tensorflow/tensorboard/bower:bower'.

The error is quite consistent and from my machine I can wget that numeric.min.js URL.
Have you see this? What does java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException even mean?
Thanks!
