Example
I restored a graph from a checkpoint and get the variables. Then I tried to write the summary to the log but got an error.
sess = tf.Session()
saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-model.meta')
saver.restore(sess, tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./'))
all_vars = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES)
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./many/log',sess.graph)
writer.add_summary(tf.summary.tensor_summary("conv", all_vars[0]))

>>> writer.add_summary(tf.summary.tensor_summary('conv',all_vars[0]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/summary/writer/writer.py", line 107, in add_summary
    event = event_pb2.Event(summary=summary)
TypeError: Parameter to MergeFrom() must be instance of same class: expected tensorflow.Summary got Tensor.

Official API Description
According to the official API (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary/FileWriter),
tf.summary.tensor_summary

Returns:
A scalar Tensor of type string. The serialized Summary protocol buffer.

add_summary(summary, global_step=None)

You can pass the result of evaluating any summary op, using tf.Session.run or tf.Tensor.eval, to this function. Alternatively, you can pass a tf.Summary protocol buffer that you populate with your own data. The latter is commonly done to report evaluation results in event files.

So I believe this is a bug.
