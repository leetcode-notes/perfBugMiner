The "multiply" operator of type Dimension has a bug.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Custom code
OS: Win10 64bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 3.6.2

CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080Ti
Exact command to reproduce: See codes below

Describe the problem
Suppose A is a tensor, L = A.shape[0]. I found that L*3 works while 3*L lead to a TypeError. Can someone fix this?
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
A = tf.placeholder( tf.float32, shape = [3, 4, 5] )
L = A.shape[0]
print( type(L) )
print( L*3 )
print( 3*L )

Output is:
