The value of a feed cannot be a tf.Tensor object. Acceptable feed values include Python scalars, str

When i feed the value, unfortunately , it is a tensor.
i have already known that i should convert it to a array or other types to feed. But if i use sess.run() or .eval(). The speed makes me crazy, for the shape is [3600,14,25500].
if other ways are available?
