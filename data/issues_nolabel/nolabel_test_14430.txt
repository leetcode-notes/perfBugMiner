Some errors in docker tf notebooks

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):CentOS 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): docker images
TensorFlow version (use command below): latest

Describe the problem
it is just a documentation problem.
in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/docker/notebooks/2_getting_started.ipynb
in section the code again, in the comments:
    # Perform gradient descent. 
    # This essentially just updates weights, like weights += grads * learning_rate
    # using the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the
    # weights. It's the direction we want to go to move toward lower error.
    update_weights = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate).minimize(loss)
I do think to update weights, you should use weights := weights - grads * learning_rate, I think using += is not a right choice
And another one is also in this section, you should use bias_with_x instead of x_with_bias
That's all.
