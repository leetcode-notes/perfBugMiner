mpi_collectives: Refactor to fix build issues

After TF commit 5c7f9e3, the mpi_collectives package would no longer build
ops and kernels. This build issue caused mpi_collectives import to fail in
Python with the following error: "NameError: Could not find operator MPISize
in dynamic library mpi_collectives.so" (ref: issue #13875).
To fix this issue, add build targets to ensure both ops and kernels are built.
Note, also refactored the build targets and directory structure to more
closely match other contrib packages.
