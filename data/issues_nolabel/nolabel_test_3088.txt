Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:422] could not set cudnn tensor descriptor: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM
Failed to run user code: signal: aborted (core dumped)

The docker container reports the expected CUDA/CUDNN version (7.5 and 4 respectively).
