Mac nightlies blocked by failing test in contrib

Last Mac nightly is May 1st
Looking at the last failure it seems it was caused by contrib
//bazel_pip/tensorflow/contrib/batching:batch_ops_test                   FAILED in 1 out of 2 in 14.5s
Since /contrib/ packages don't always have maintainers, should the "Success" criteria perhaps be relaxed to still release the pip package if some /contrib/ thing fail? @martinwicke
