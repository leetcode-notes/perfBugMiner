Fix how error message is generated when running configure

Very minor fix:
When your TF_CUDA_VERSION does not match the observed CUDA version, an error is raised. Before this patch, the error message generation fails because the % operator is applied to only half of the format string. After this patch it correctly creates the error message and displays it as expected.
