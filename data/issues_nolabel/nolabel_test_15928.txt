Utility classes for writing Java source code from a C++ process (part 2)

Part 2 of pull request #14094 that has been splitted into several commits.
This part features only a language-agnostic writer that outputs generated source code into a file or in memory. Note that this class is being kept apart from the Java-specific code generators since it could be a good candidate to be moved in the core io library in the future (ref #13748).
