The usage of `Dataset.from_generator()` function

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Centos 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.7
Python version: 3.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8
GPU model and memory: 1080Ti

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I tried to use Dataset.from_generator function to return a dataset.
    ds = Dataset.from_generator(data,
                                (tf.float32,tf.float32, tf.int64, tf.bool),
                                (tf.TensorShape([None, None, num_features]),
                                 tf.TensorShape([None, None]),
                                 tf.TensorShape([None]),
                                 tf.TensorShape([])
                                 ))
but I met the error, which is against the API guide.
File "/opt/python/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow/python/data/util/nest.py", line 365, in assert_shallow_structure "Input has type: %s." % type(input_tree)) TypeError: If shallow structure is a sequence, input must also be a sequence. Input has type: <class 'list'>.
I also tried numpy array and tensorflow tensor but I met the identical error.
What should I return to use this API?
Should this API support numpy array and tensorflow tensor?
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
