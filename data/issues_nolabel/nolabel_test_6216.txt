task assignment in tensorflow distributed process

I'm confused about the distributed training process in tensorflow.
I think the tensorflow feed a batch_size of data to a worker and then the worker update the ps server,is this right?
But when training , I noticed that the step number in the log may strange.
If I have only 2 workers , I thinks the right process should be some thing like
[worker1] step 0 xxxxxxx
[worker2] step 100 xxxxxxx
[worker1] step 200 xxxxxxx
[worker2] step 300 xxxxxxx
.....
every worker should print different step to log.
Actually , the log are as below:
[worker1] step 0 xxxxxxx
[worker2] step 100 xxxxxxx
[worker1] step 100 xxxxxxx
[worker2] step 200 xxxxxxx
[worker1] step 300 xxxxxxx
...
Why the worker1 dosn't print step 200?
I am confused about the job assign .... a step to a worker? or every worker run every step?
