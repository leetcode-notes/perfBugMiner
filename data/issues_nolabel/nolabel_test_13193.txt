Allow partial shape inference for `tf.nn.conv2d_transpose`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #8972 where it was not possible to infer a partial shape for
tf.nn.conv2d_transpose. In case any dimensions are not defined, the shape will be totally undefined.
This fix utilizes tensor_util.constant_value_as_shape so that partial shape is possible.
This fix fixes #8972.
