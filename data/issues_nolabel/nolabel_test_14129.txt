Eager: Distributed Execution

(This applies only when eager execution has been enabled via tfe.enable_eager_execution())
If the model does not involve dynamic control flow in Python (i.e., changing the computation based on input), then the same model code can be used to construct a TensorFlow graph, which can then be trained with distributed TensorFlow
Some example models like MNIST, ResNet50, and the PTB RNN include unittests outlining how the same model code can be used to construct and train TensorFlow graphs.
A smoother path to distributed TensorFlow when eager execution is enabled is being charted out.
