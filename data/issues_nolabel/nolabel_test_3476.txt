How to initialize LSTMStateTuple ?

In ptb_word_lm.py tutorial. When I set tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell to  state_is_tuple=True, it fail initialise the state at the begining of each epoch. What is the way to initialise a LSTMStateTuple ?
I did use cell.zero_state to get the varible for the initial state, which works fine. However, when I want to get initial values of the initial state using initial_state.eval(), I got an error saying that AttributeError: LSTMStateTuple object has no attribute 'eval'.
Please see a simplified version of my code below (this code works well when state_is_tuple=False)
    state = lstm.initial_state.eval()
    for step, (x, y) in enumerate(reader.ptb_iterator(train_data,
                                                    batch_size, num_steps)):
        feed_dict = {
            input_data: x, targets: y,
            lstm.initial_state: state
        }
        _cost, state, _ = sess.run(
            [cost, lstm.final_state, train_op],
            feed_dict=feed_dict
        )

The main reason for feeding this initial_state into feed_dict is to propagate the cell's state to the next iteration.
Many Thank
