Install tensorflow with virtualenv failed

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary with virtualenv
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 tensorflow

Describe the problem
On my Ubuntu 16.04, I'm trying to install tensorflow with virtualenv for python3 under the guide of https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_linux.
But I got the error message at the step2:
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 tensorflow
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/local/anaconda3/bin/python3
Using base prefix '/usr/local/anaconda3'
New python executable in /home/lab/tensorflow/bin/python3
Also creating executable in /home/lab/tensorflow/bin/python
/home/lab/tensorflow/bin/python3: error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.6m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
ERROR: The executable /home/lab/tensorflow/bin/python3 is not functioning
ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is '/home/lab' (should be '/home/lab/tensorflow')
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable

Notice that I've install anaconda3.
Is anaconda3 incompatible with tensorflow or virtualenv?
Should I uninstall my anaconda3 before installing tensorflow?
Thanks to everybody first!
