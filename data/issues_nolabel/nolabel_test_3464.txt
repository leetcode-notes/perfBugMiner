Extract the element from the output list of tf.py_func when length 1

tf.py_func could extract the element from the list when the length is 1.
In this example:
def func(x):
    return 2*x

x = tf.constant(1.)
res = tf.py_func(func, [x], [tf.float32])

res is a list containing 1 Tensor. This can be confusing, because users expect to get only one tensor as output.
tf.cond handles this case well:

Returns:
Tensors returned by the call to either fn1 or fn2. If the callables return a singleton list, the element is extracted from the list.
