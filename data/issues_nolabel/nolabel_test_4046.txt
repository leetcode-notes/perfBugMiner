Fuse resize and mirror padding ops into convolutions

Spatial transformations like padding and bilinear resizing can be merged into the im2col stage of conv2d. This reduces the memory usage considerably (from 338MB to 224MB) and latency (by 15%) on some models, and helps us avoid OOM crashes on iOS. This PR has all the changes needed to fuse these particular ops, including the kernels themselves and integration into the optimize_for_inference script.
