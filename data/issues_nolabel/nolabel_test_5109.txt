Segmentation fault with basic indexing and slicing

The following code generates a segmentation fault.
It should obviously return an error because op has only one dimension and a ask for two.
But an alert is probably more informative than a segmentation fault.

import tensorflow as tf

v = tf.Variable([1,1,1])
op = v * v
value = op[0,:]

sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(value))
