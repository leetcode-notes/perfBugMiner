Feature request: space_to_depth with overlapping blocks (like im2col)

Currently tf.space_to_depth only works for rearranging non-overlapping blocks into depth. It would be nice if also worked for overlapping blocks, with an extra parameter to set the stride:

A stride equal to the block size would be equivalent to the current non-overlapping behavior.
A stride equal to 1 would be equivalent to an im2col operation.

An im2col-like operation could be used to easily implement a locally connected layer ("convolution with unshared weights"), by combining it with an elementwise multiplication with the matrix that contains the local filters, followed by a summation along the channel dimension.
