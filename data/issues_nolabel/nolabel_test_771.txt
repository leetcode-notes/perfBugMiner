Had issues running ./configure and bazel build commands

I did not get any error when I ran ./configure but when i ran
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
I get following error
Sending SIGTERM to previous Bazel server (pid=2919)... done.

I was actually able to solve this problem and successfully run TF with GPUs by following exactly the instructions on this page, which did not mention ./configure or the bazel build command

Please reflect these instructions or some modified version of the instructions on the Getting Started page of Tensorflow as this particular step caused a lot of grief :)
