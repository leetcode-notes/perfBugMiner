Unable to infer shape of placeholder

myPlaceholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[4, 5])
tf.shape(myPlaceholder).eval()

InvalidArgumentError: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'Placeholder_1' with dtype float and shape [4,5]

One shouldn't have to feed a value for the placeholder because the shape is already determined.
