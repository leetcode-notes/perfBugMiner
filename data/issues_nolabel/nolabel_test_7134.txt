[Java] [Feature] Load from SavedModel

Make it possible for the Java library to load exported TF models in SavedModel format.
Outline of the proposed design:

Define a new class SavedModelBundle to represent the loaded saved model.  Properties include the graph, session, and metagraphdef.
Define a static method on SavedModelBundle to load from disk, given an export path and some tags.

class SavedModelBundle implements AutoCloseable { 
  public Graph graph() { ... }
  public Session session() { ... }
  public byte[] metaGraphDef() { ... }
  public void close() { /* close the session and graph */ }
  public static SavedModelBundle loadSavedModel(String exportDir, Set<String> tags) { ... }
}


Write a JNI method to support loading, based on TF_LoadSessionFromSavedModel from the C API.
