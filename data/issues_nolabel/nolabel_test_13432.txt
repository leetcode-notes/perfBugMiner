An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback. and low accuracy

The accuracy I get for sklearn and tensorflow is 0.428571. And after that I get a line that says: An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.
What should I do? What is the accuracy that I am supposed to get?
