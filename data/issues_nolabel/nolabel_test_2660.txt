Max Pooling NCHW

In the documentation for the tf.nn.max_pool() op, it is written:
data_format: A string. 'NHWC' and 'NCHW' are supported.
However, when I specify 'NCHW' as the data format, I receive the error "Default MaxPoolingOp only supports NHWC" (generated here in master when this was written).
It was my understanding that most ops have been ported to NCHW to support CuDNN natively - so I was surprised to see this wasn't implemented.
