Tensorflow seq-to-seq Arabic chatbot

i'm working on an AI-chatbot for Arabic Language. I follow this tutorial in tensrflow seq-to-seq model. So far everything is doing great where i trained the model on my Arabic data using GPU and test the pre-trained model.But the some of them answers were correct while other are unrelated at all.
So, my questions are:


the model uses GRU in creating the model, should i change it to LSTM?


i used the same tokenizer in the (French to English translation tutorial), should i change it and use an Arabic tokenizer?


Even if i write an input it will reply with Arabic sentence, what i need is if the inout is new to the chatbot it should say "sorry i don't understand" for example


Basically, is there are changes should be done to make the chatbot handles the Arabic language very well
