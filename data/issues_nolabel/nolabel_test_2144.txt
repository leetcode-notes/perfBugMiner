Tensorboard tensor representation when a Op (or a node) has multiple output tensors

I'm using the op 'tf.train.shuffle_batch,' has two output tensors, feature and label.
When I visualize it on tensorboard, thickness of edge(tensor) looks weird.
The label tensor, to loss node, has thickness of the feature tensor.
It seems like current tensorboard visualizes thickness using first output tensor of the op for all out edges.
Is it possible? multiple output tensors has their own shape?
