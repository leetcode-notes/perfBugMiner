tensorflow running principle

In tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq_model.py  line 236 , we see the output_feed cosists of  self.updates and self.gradient_norms.
And the self.updates is not used in anywhere, I wonder if I can delete this from output_feed ?
How does the tensorflow run:  If a variable is not in its output_feed list, does tensorflow count this variable ?
