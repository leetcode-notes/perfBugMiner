How to build tensorflow to use SSE3 instructions?

When I am running tensorflow code, it prompts that The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.. I have installed tensorflow using pip and don't know how to deal with that. Any one can help with me?
