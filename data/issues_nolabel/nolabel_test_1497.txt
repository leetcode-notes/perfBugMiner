Hey, I wanted to know where can i find the implementation of the tensorflow with respect to devices like GPU. Basically I want to understand from source code level what changes are done inside the tensor flow to make it comptabile to GPU when launched. How  does the CUDA compile/run come into play when a session is launched ? Appreciate the help/pointers.
