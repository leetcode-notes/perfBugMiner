Cannot reshape variable with `validate_shape=False`

Given the following code:
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((3, 4)), validate_shape=False)
transposed = tf.reshape(x, [tf.shape(x)[1], -1])

init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)

print(sess.run(transposed))
I got the following error:
TypeError: Expected int32, got list containing Tensors of type '_Message' instead.
