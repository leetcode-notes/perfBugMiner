Always bind "localhost" when starting workers

Now we have tried distributed TensorFlow and run multiple workers. It works but we found that it always bind "localhost" when I would like to bind one of my NICs.
Is it the bug? Or do I miss something because I found nothing to configure it in any document.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:  No
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.

root@100cd4fb5bca:/notebooks# pip --version
pip 8.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)


The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

root@100cd4fb5bca:/notebooks# python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"
0.8.0

Steps to reproduce

docker run -it tensorflow/tensorflow bash
Write the server code of one_worker.py.
python ./one_worker.py

root@100cd4fb5bca:/notebooks# cat one_worker.py
import tensorflow as tf

worker1 = "www.a.com:2222"
worker_hosts = [worker1]

cluster_spec = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"worker": worker_hosts})

server = tf.train.Server(cluster_spec, job_name="worker", task_index=0)

server.join()
