ImportError: No module named tensorflow after installing from sources

I installed TF from sources because I do not have an internet access. I used @damienmg tricks to replace git repositories by internal sources for eigen, six, gemmlowp, re2, libpng and jpegsvrc.
Finally the line bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer compiled successfully (however there were several warnings of index subscript above limits and comparison between signed and unsigned (I figure it is because it is a beta version of eigen)).
And I ran the example bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer
It ran and the end line was :
000002/000005 lambda=2.000000 x =[0.894427 -0.447214] y =[1.788854 -0.894427]
However when I try to run python wherever import tensorflow fails with error no module named tensorflow (I am using anaconda if it is important and when I ran the configure the path for python was correct).
Where do you think I got it wrong ?
