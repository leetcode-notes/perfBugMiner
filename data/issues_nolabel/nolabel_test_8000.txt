Android Camera Detection with Yolo model not working

I trained and generated my yolo model accodring to the repository https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow. While testing on few images locally, the model detects objects.
Once I build and test it on the phone (adding .pb to assets and setting flag to YOLO), TFDetect runs but I obtain no detections at all.
What could be the cause of that and how could I actually start debugging?
(trying to run the default graph-tiny-yolo-voc.pb specified in the example demo, succeeded)
