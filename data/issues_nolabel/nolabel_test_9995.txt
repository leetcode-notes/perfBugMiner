Update rnn.py

Support returning all states generated in dynamic_rnn if the states are rather 'simple'
Unit test could be found here
p.s. I finished this implementation under API r1.1 and I found the latest code of tensorflow.python.ops.rnn.py is quite different from that on my Windows machine with API r1.1. Since I cannot build the source code, though I've tested them under API r1.1, I haven't actually tested the committed codes in the latest environment
