Attempting to use uninitialized value lstm/LSTMCell/W_0 on Distributed TensorFlow

On a cluster of Tensorflow, which has one ps server, and one worker:
def inference(self, inds, early_stops):

            ...

            with tf.variable_scope('lstm_encoder') as scope:
                initializer = tf.random_uniform_initializer(-0.08, 0.08)
                lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.hidden_units, initializer = initializer, state_is_tuple = True)
                if self.is_training and self.keep_prob < 1:
                    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper(lstm_cell, output_keep_prob = self.keep_prob)

       ...
 with tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(worker_device =
                                                          '/job:worker/task:%d' % int(os.environ['task_index']), cluster = cluster)):
                train_op, loss = inference()
it turns out that:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.FailedPreconditionError: Attempting to use uninitialized value sentiment/lstm_encoder/RNN/LSTMCell/W_0
     [[Node: sentiment/lstm_encoder/RNN/LSTMCell/W_0_S8 = _Send[T=DT_FLOAT, client_terminated=false, recv_device="/job:worker/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0", send_device="/job:ps/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0", send_device_incarnation=-5768356229269645157, tensor_name="edge_226_sentiment/lstm_encoder/RNN/LSTMCell/W_0", _device="/job:ps/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"](sentiment/lstm_encoder/RNN/LSTMCell/W_0)]]

I try to place variables on cpu or gpu, both of them did not work.
