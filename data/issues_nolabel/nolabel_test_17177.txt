logits or log probabilities?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4 and 1.5
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: Tried several
GPU model and memory: CPU and GPU, but GPU was nvidia p100
Exact command to reproduce: See "source code" below

Describe the problem
There seems to be some confusion about logits vs log probabilities.  In some cases logits seem to mean just log probabilities.  In other cases they seem to mean actual logits, log(p/(1-p)) which is quite a different thing.  It seems possible to me that this is causing downstream bugs, potentially big ones in edward, though I haven't looked closely.
Other people also seem confused.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops.distributions import util as distribution_util
import numpy as np

tf.reset_default_graph()
sess=tf.Session()

inp = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32)
logits,probs=distribution_util.get_logits_and_probs(logits=inp)

categ=tf.distributions.Categorical(logits=inp)
vals=categ.sample(100000)

probsv,valsv=sess.run([probs,vals],feed_dict={inp:np.log([.2,.3,.5])})

print(probsv)
print([np.mean(valsv==x) for x in range(3)])

[0.16666667 0.23076922 0.33333334]
[0.20078, 0.29984, 0.49938]

So in some cases logits seems to mean log probabilities, but on other cases
it seem to actually mean logits.
