ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so: undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct

I update my tensorflow to 1.5, the last version is 1.3.0. But I got a issue about numpy, after lot of attempts, it was solved, numpy can be used.
But now, I have a new issue when I import tensorflow:
