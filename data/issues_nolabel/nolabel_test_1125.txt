Example image code using image module.

I couldn't find decode_png, convert_image_dtype or rgb_to_hsv added to the tf module.
Updated examples to use the functions on the tf.image module instead. Unfortunately, the example code was used on the how to document page as well.
A minor spelling adjustment is included as well.
