Segmentation Fault When Importing Tensorflow

GitHub issues are for bugs / installation problems / feature requests.
For general support from the community, see StackOverflow.
To make bugs and feature requests more easy to find and organize, we close issues that are deemed
out of scope for GitHub Issues and point people to StackOverflow.
For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more easily we will be able to offer
help and advice.
Environment info
Operating System: CentOS 6.8/RedHat 6.8
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
CUDA 7.5 + cuDNN v4
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

Steps to reproduce

Install tensorflow by using anaconda (conda command)
Install glibc "locally" and add the path /glibc-2.14/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Open python and use the command "import tensorflow as tf", and then you will get the message "Segmentation Fault". No other messages.

What have you tried?

Use gdb to see what causes the segmentation fault.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__pthread_init_static_tls (map=0x0) at allocatestack.c:1196
1196        init_one_static_tls (list_entry (runp, struct pthread, list), map);
from /home/abc/Libraries/glibc-2.14/install/lib/libpthread.so.0
Because they are clusters, it is hard (or nearly impossible in the near future) to upgrade the OSs. I also have no root privilege.
At first, I got an error telling that I don't have glibc_2.14.so because RedHat/CentOS 6.8 only comes with glibc 2.12. Therefore, I locally compiled the glibc and added it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. After then, the glibc_2.14 error disappeared and was replaced by another error "Segmentation Fault" (no other messages). Something like this:
import tensorflow as tf
Segmentation Fault
(tensorflow) bash-4.1$
I tried to use gdb to see what causes this error, and it turns out it is "libpthread.so.0".
Any ideas?
Thanks.
