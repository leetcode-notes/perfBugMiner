tfdbg: add persistent config (cherry-pick to r1.4)

Add two persistent UI configurations backed by a file at ~/.tfdbg_config by default.

graph_recursion_depth, which controls the recursive output of li/lo commands.
mouse_mode, which controls the mouse state of the CursesUI.


Add config command to set and inspect the persistent configuration. E.g.,

config show
config set graph_recursion_depth 3
config set mouse_mode False
