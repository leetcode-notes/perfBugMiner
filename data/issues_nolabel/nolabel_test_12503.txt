Add cudnn7 support

Attention @zheng-xq

Account for cudnnSetRNNDescriptor API change
Add support for CUDNN_TENSOR_OP_MATH in cudnn v7

Applies to forward and backward convolutions that have fp16
input/output. Computations will fall back to pseudo-fp16
if tensor op math is disabled or not supported.
Enabled by default, but can be disabled using the environment
variable TF_ENABLE_TENSOR_OP_MATH=0.
The choice of whether to use tensor op math is included in the
autotuning of convolutions.
