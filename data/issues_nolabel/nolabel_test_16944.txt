Tensorflow (0.11.0) returns error while running training and testing scripts.

Due to some constraint i am using Tensorflow version 0.11.0, which i installed using bellow commands:
export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
After installation i am successfully able to import Tensorflow in python:
cvsion@cvsion:~$ python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'
0.11.0

cvsion@cvsion:~/Deeplearning/DeepTensorFlow/tensorlayer$ python 
Python 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> 

but when i am running my training script its giving error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./testing_nvidia.py", line 8, in 
import tensorlayer as tl
File "/home/cvsion/Deeplearning/DeepTensorFlow/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/init.py", line 23, in 
from . import distributed
File "/home/cvsion/Deeplearning/DeepTensorFlow/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/distributed.py", line 9, in 
from tensorflow.python.training import session_run_hook
ImportError: cannot import name session_run_hook

Any idea to resolve above issue
