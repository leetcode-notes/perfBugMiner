pip install failing for Python3.4 but fine for Python3.5

I have been following the installation for Python3.4 using
sudo pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
The installation says it was successful
When I try to run the examples I get an error
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/lib/python3.4/inspect.py", line 977, in getfullargspec

raise ValueError("no signature found for builtin {!r}".format(func))
ValueError: no signature found for builtin <method 'max' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects>
The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

I manually downloaded, renamed and installed the wheel for Python3.5 and it is now working.
