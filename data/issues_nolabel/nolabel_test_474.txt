How to change the type of placeholder

I declared a placeholder with labels=tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=(5)),
while when I checked the shape of 'labels' with tf.shape(labels), it returned
Tensor("Shape_2:0", shape=TensorShape([Dimension(1)]), dtype=int32, device=/gpu:1) TensorShape([Dimension(5)]).
Obviously I set labels as tf.float32, it is actually int32. How can I resolve it. Thanks in advance.
