Exif Orientation support tf.image.decode_jpeg()

Hi.
I have large amounts of JPEG files uploaded by users on our service .
They use mainly smartphone camera, so most files contain EXIF orientation metadata.
It would seem that the tf.image.decode_jpeg() ignores this information,
So I cannot build pipeline using pure tensor operation.
I thought it is not better to writing custom decoder depending external libraries, considering complying thread safety and future compatibility.
My Pipeline code is like below:
filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(files)
reader = tf.WholeFileReader()
key, supplyContent = reader.read(filename_queue)
decoding = tf.image.decode_jpeg(supplyContent, channels=3)
#  source image may have orientation but dropped 
resizing = tf.image.resize_images(decoding, (IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE))
# ...
Transformation of image can be done with simple tensor op, since tf.image has many convenience methods.
How about adding support for these meta informations ?
