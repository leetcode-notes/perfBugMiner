AVX512F is not compiled when running "hello world" test using Tensorflow 1.6 on Intel KNL

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No custom code


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary, follow the instructions from intel,

Describe the problem
It seems that AVX512F is not compiled into released tensorflow 1.6. (but other KNL specific AVX512 instructions are compiled!!!)
I run simple "hello world" test on KNL after install the tensorflow 1.6 by following the steps mentioned here!!
it give me the message as follows:
2018-03-08 13:08:26.924344: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:140] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX512F
BTW, i try to compile the tensorflow 1.6 from source code, and adding all of avxxxxx as -copt to bazel build cmd, after build tensorflow 1.6 package correctly, re-run above test program, it seems the "AVX512F" is compiled!!!!
Source code / logs

simple program, just print "hello tensorflow" using tensorflow.
