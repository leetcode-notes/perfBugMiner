How can I get Bazel to build iteratively?

In 0.5.0, I could change files (e.g. tensorflow/models/rnn/seq2seq.py) and recompile iteratively with no problem. In 0.6.0, making changes in files like tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell.py, etc, gives me pretty long recompile times. I'm not sure that it's doing a full rebuild, but it's def not the snappy few second rebuilds I was experiencing before. I didn't see an issue about this and so I'm wondering if it's something with my setup. Is this a common problem?
