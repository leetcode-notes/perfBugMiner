Why not support passing extras tensors from input_fn to model_fn in estimator?

Sometimes input_fn may create some tensors that are useful in model_fn, these tensors can't be create outside input_fn to ensure they are in the same graph as tensors in models.
It seems that we can put those tensors to 'labels' returned by input_fn, but because these tensors are same across batch samples, so it will cause problems when we use replicate_model_fn. (replicate_model_fn will split each tensors in 'features' or 'labels' to each GPU, but those tensors stay same across all batch samples )
