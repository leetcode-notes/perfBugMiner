Add `tf.write_file` op

Tensorflow currently has a tf.read_file op, as documented here.
Can we have a tf.write_file as well?
It could be defined as something like:
def write_file(tensor, filename, name=None):
    def write_data(data):
        with open(filename, "wb") as handle:
            handle.write(data)

    with tf.name_scope("WriteFile" or name):
        tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(tensor, name="Values")
        return tf.py_func(write_data, tensor)
There are some usecases where this would be helpful, such as generating images and audio and then writing them to disk. Presumably, this would be done after an op such as encode_jpeg or encode_audio.
If this already exists in some form, please close this â€“ my apologies, but some googling as well as searching on Github did not find it.
