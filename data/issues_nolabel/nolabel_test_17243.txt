Would a vector field layer be a welcome addition?

Here is a paper I stumbled upon yesterday. It describes an interesting, visual approach of separation of mixed set of points in high dimensional spaces into linearly separable set of points by learning a vector field that carries input points to new locations.
Coupled with Tensorboard, such a layer would provide intuition as to what the network is doing. We would "see" how it warps the space to provide linear separability.
I have started coding up such a layer to run some visualizations. Note that this would be a first contribution to the code base, so excuse any dumb things as I am learning the code base.
and I am wondering if anyone wants to collaborate on the implementation, and if upon successful implementation and tests, such a layer could be accepted into the code base.
