convert tf.cond to constants failed by convert_variables_to_constants.

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
0.9.0
Steps to reproduce
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework.graph_util import convert_variables_to_constants
def save_model(sess, output_node_names, path = "predict.pb"):
output_list =  output_node_names
output_graph_def = convert_variables_to_constants(sess, sess.graph_def, output_list)
X1 = tf.Variable(1.)
X2 = tf.Variable(1.)
cond_value = tf.Variable(True)
cond_result = tf.cond(cond_value, lambda: tf.assign(X1, 2.), lambda: tf.assign(X2, 2.), name="cond_result")
X3 = tf.add(X1, X2,"X3")
with tf.Session() as sesh:
sesh.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
#sesh.run(cond_result)
save_model(sesh, ["X3",])
What have you tried?

Test above code, convert_variables_to_constants failed.
If comment the line of tf.cond, call save model will be OK.
