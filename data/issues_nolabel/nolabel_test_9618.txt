Can't load the model file from model_dir in CNN text classifier

Dear all,
I am working on NLP using tensor flow, i am using thhe text classifier using cnn from the tensor flow git hub example, where i stored my trained model by passing "model_dir" argument successfully , but when i try to reload the model it says an error
Error occurring part of my code is,
"
classifier = learn.Estimator(model_fn=cnn_model,model_dir = "/home/local/models/")
#classifier.fit(x_train, y_train, steps=1000)
y_predicted = [p['class'] for p in classifier.predict(x_test, as_iterable=True)]
print(y_predicted)
"
this is a code when i try to reload the model file files from the "model_dir" which is already stored in it when train.
The error is ,
"

Please help me to solve this problem.
Thank you in advance.
