tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits documentation error

It looks like there may be a documentation error in tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits.
It mentions "ValueError: If logits are scalars (need to have rank >= 1) or if the rank of the labels is not equal to the rank of the labels minus one."
Based on the argument requirements above, I believe this should read "ValueError: If logits are scalars (need to have rank >= 1) or if the rank of the labels is not equal to the rank of the logits minus one."
