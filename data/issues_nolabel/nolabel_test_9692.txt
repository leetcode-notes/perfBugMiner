Following steps to get tensorflow up on hexagon from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/hvx


Please update git clone https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/hexagon_nn/nnlib with
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git in the readme


tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf/autogen.sh:


below autogen.sh is modified gmock ->(with) googlemock
as well gtest ->(with) googletest.
as m4_include(../googletest/m4/acx_pthread.m4) in tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf/googlemock/configure.ac is referring to googletest.
if test ! -e googlemock; then
   echo "Google Mock not present.  Fetching gmock-1.7.0 from the web..."
   curl $curlopts -L -O https://github.com/google/googlemock/archive/release-1.7.0.zip
   unzip -q release-1.7.0.zip
   rm release-1.7.0.zip
   mv googlemock-release-1.7.0 googlemock
 
   curl $curlopts -L -O https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.7.0.zip
   unzip -q release-1.7.0.zip
   rm release-1.7.0.zip
   mv googletest-release-1.7.0 googlemock/googletest
 fi

please let me know gtest/gmock is getting reffered somewhere as it can be modified to googletest/googlemock in protobuf/autogen.sh
thanks.
