__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dct_method'

System information

What is the top-level directory of the model you are using:
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Projects\models
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Just changed the filename of 'train.py' to 'my_train.py'.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.5
CUDA/cuDNN version:
CUDA v9.0
GPU model and memory:
NVDIA GeForce GT 730

Describe the problem
Is the new version have some bugs or my installation is incorrect? because I saw the source code of the 'Image' class of tf.example_decoder, it is no an argument named 'dec_method' in the 'init' method. If my description or log is not clear enough, please tell me. Thanks in advance!
