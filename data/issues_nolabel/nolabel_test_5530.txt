How to allow GPU memory growth under TF slim?

Under TF library, we can set how GPU memory is used by creating a config as below and then assign to a session.
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = tf.Session(config=config)
However, I can't find any such config to let TF slim library to set memory usage mode. Directly put such config to slim.learning.train() method?
