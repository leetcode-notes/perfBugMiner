convert_to_records.py don't write all values into .tfrecords file

Hi,
at first i suppose there is a typing mistake in line 56 (dat.shape[0], num_examples) i think it should be (images.shape[0],num_examples). the second thing was that this code did'nt wrote me the depth values into .tfrecords file. I need to pass them as _bytes_feature(str(depth)) after that the value was written into .tfrecords file.
