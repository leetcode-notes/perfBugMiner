iOS Example Make Build Error

I am following the iOS static TF build on the "Building By Hand" section found here.  I am running the build command after downloading dependencies and compiling successfully.
When running make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile TARGET=IOS IOS_ARCH=ARM64, there is a generated error that stops the build.
error:statement expression not allowed at file scope

I have recreated this problem on two different computers, and on a freshly pulled version
Xcode 7.3.1, OS X 10.11.5
