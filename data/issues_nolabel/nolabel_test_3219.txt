docker exec -it to start the interactive terminal

As per the current documentation,
$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888  gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow should be used to access the CLI.
However, the previous command starts the Notebook App. The CLI is not available. To access the CLI, we need to access the container by creating a new interactive terminal to it.
Hence, I added a second step using docker exec.
