weights_initializer in tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected

Hi,
At present contrib.layers.fully_connected is unable to accept a Tensor as an initializer for the weights.
This because when calling variable_scope.get_variable (which accepts a Tensor as an initializer) it specifies both the initializer and the shape. Is this expected behavior or a bug?
I have put together a small gist  that illustrates the issue.
At present what's the recommended way to pass a Tensor as an initializer? Would a dummy init_fn be acceptable?
I'm currently running rev: 9c11fe2.
Thanks,
Marco
