Maybe bug in quantize_graph.py

In line 489 of quantize_graph.py
def quantize_nodes_recursively(self, current_node):
    """The entry point for quantizing nodes to eight bit and back."""
    if self.already_visited[current_node.name]:
      return
The initial value of dic self.already_visited is empty ,so the statement
if self.already_visited[current_node.name]:
may raise exception.
So I think it would be better to update to ：
if self.already_visited.has_key(current_node.name):
Same issue also in ：
def round_nodes_recursively(self, current_node)
Please take a look, thanks!
