Arch doesn't support it

After sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl or as root, I got:
tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
It seems it doesn't work with Python 3. What should I do?
