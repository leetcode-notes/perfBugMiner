Benchmarking GPU ops in Tensorflow Graphs

I tried using the tool for benchmarking Tensorflow Graphs at
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/benchmark
Seems it only gives the memory profile for RAM per ops. How can I get the GPU memory and utilization profile per ops using this tool?
