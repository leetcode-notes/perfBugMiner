retraining on gpu causing high clone loss

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Linux 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):  0.9
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.1
GPU model and memory: gtx 1050 ti
Exact command to reproduce:

Tensorflow gpu produces strange clone loss(very high) while retraining with resnet 50, the loss though is not produced while retraining on a cpu. What could be the cause of this behaviour?
