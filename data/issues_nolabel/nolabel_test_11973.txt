[Java] Build rules and skeleton for operation wrappers generator

In this PR, Bazel rules to generate operation wrappers in Java at build-time and a very minimal implementation of the generator (in C++) are added.
For now, the generator only create empty packages (one package per op-library) and combine them into a source archive (.srcjar) that is added as a source dependency of the tensorflow Java library target.
The goal of this PR is to make sure that everything is setup properly and agreed on before starting to generate for real the operation wrappers.
