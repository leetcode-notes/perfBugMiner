How to configure gpu memory fraction outside of my own code?

My tensorflow automatically allocates all of my GPU memory.
I know the way to configure 'gpu memory fraction' in my own code like the below
import tensorflow as tf
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.2)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))

I added the codes at the front of my code, so it worked well.
BUT I want to use tensorflow in distributed processing (e.g. spark)
Adding the configuration code in the code is not working in the distributed processing since configuration in the code is applied to only master machine, not to other machines.
SO, I try to configure gpu memory fraction of tensorflow itself.
how can I do??
