Why has the RNN API changed so drastically?

The new 0.9 version has 3 changes which has broken my existing functionality.

Have to use tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell instead of tensorflow.models.rnn.rnn_cell
Have to use cell(inputs, state..) instead of rnn.rnn(cell, inputs, state ...)
Initial_state keyword arg has been removed
Worst of all, i can't find any mention of variable sequence length in the new version of rnn_cell code

Can someone at least advice on how to use variable sequence lengths in this version? For now I'm reverting back to 0.8 so my code works again
