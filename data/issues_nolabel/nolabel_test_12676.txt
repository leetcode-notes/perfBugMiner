Tensorflow building error

I am trying to build tensorflow with this statement "bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo"
the WORKSPACE is
`android_sdk_repository(
name = "androidsdk",
api_level = 23,
#build_tools_version = "25.0.2",
build_tools_version = "26.0.1",
path = "C:/Users/ST/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk",
)
android_ndk_repository(
name="androidndk",
path="C:/Users/ST/Downloads/Tensorflow_Compile/android-ndk-r12b",
api_level=14)
`
but I got an error message:
"ERROR: C:/msys64/tmp/_bazel_st/_ztysx-6/external/protobuf_archive/BUILD:93:1: C++ compilation of rule '@protobuf_archive//:protobuf_lite' failed (Exit 3).
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.

I am using Windows 10, bazel 0.5.4, python 2.7. Is there anyway to fix this problem?
