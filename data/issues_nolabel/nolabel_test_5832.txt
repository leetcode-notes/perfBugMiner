Still 0.11.RC0 after upgrading to RC2

I've used Anaconda-Pip installation in the tutorial to upgrade my TensorFlow
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, CPU only, Python 3.5
(tensorflow)$ export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl

# Python 3
(tensorflow)$ pip3 install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL

....> ipython

In [1]: import tensorflow as tf
In [2]: tf.__version__
Out[2]: '0.11.0rc0'


But it seems it is still in RC0, in which doesn't include new method such as tf.summary.merge_all()
