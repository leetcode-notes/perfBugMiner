[W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:993] Failed precondition

I want to run the tensorflow-deeplab-resnet,and I prepared my own training data for it. But When I try to run train.py to train data, it always did not work. And the error are as  follows:

I have written the path address for the training set explicitlyï¼Œbut the training program doesn't work properly.
Can you help me with this problem?
Thanks a lot!
