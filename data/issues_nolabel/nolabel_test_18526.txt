Tensorflow is a big issue

I am using Windows 10 and Python 3.6 with jupyter notebook. I simply wanted to use tensorflow because of its hyped popularity but it seems like a real pain.
first issue with installing tensorflow, then if installed then issue with importing tensorflow. Giving dumps like
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pywrap_tensorflow_internal'
ImportError: DLL load failed: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.
Looked for this issue then found need to have CUDA and cuDNN from NVIDIA which doesn't allow if you are not an NVIDIA developer.
I am not able to download cuDNN which seems "very" important for tensorflow to work.
Can anyone please suggest how can I simply import tensorflow?
