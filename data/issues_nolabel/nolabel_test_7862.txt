RealDiv, VariableV2 ops still in system after uninstalling tf-gpu

Hi, thanks for making tf available! I'm having an issue reverting to tf-cpu. I'm using riga/tfdeploy to distribute trained models, which is not compatible with tf-gpu. I installed tf-gpu for an experiment, then reverted to cpu, all using pip install/uninstall. Now I'm getting error messages about unknown ops like RealDiv and VariableV2.
My question is: How can I remove any trace of tf-gpu from my system and get back to tf-cpu?

Environment info
Operating System: Win 10 64 bit, Python 3.5.3
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
None
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
Just used "pip install tensorflow" (uses tensorflow-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl)
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
1.0.0

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

pip install tensorflow
run a tf.Session() - no ops like RealDiv etc., tfdeploy runs fine.
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu
Some trace of these ops remains registered, causing warnings like OpKernel ('op: "BestSplits" device_type: "CPU"') for unknown op: BestSplits while runninng tf, and also causing frameworks like riga/tfdeploy to crash

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I have tried completely reinstalling Python 3, deleting all site-packages etc. I've installed and uninstalled CUDA. The ops seem to be registered somewhere, leading to different behavior of tf-cpu after installing and uninstalling tf-gpu.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
The best clue is maybe errors like unknown op: BestSplits, which did not occur in tf-cpu before I installed and uninstalled tf-gpu.
Also, tfdeploy gives error messages like unknown operation: RealDiv, which did not happen prior to installing and uninstalling tf-gpu.
Any pointers on getting rid of/unregistering these ops is appreciated!
