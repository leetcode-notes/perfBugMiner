Casting from real to complex lacks gradient

The operation of casting from float32 to complex64 lacks a gradient:
>>> x = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))
>>> tf.gradients(tf.cast(x, dtype=tf.complex64), x)
[None]

Surely this is not intentional?
(FWIW, I'm on Tensorflow 0.9.0, running on the CPU on OS X.)
