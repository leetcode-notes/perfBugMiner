[XLA] RNG root instruction can be fused as it effectively has one user

The existing test checks for a single user when trying to fuse a random number generator instruction.   This is because if it is fused but has multiple users, the value may be generated an incorrect number of times.  (multiple users should receive the same random number, not different ones).
The test checks for users() length == 1.  This ignores the case there the instruction is the root, where users() length == 0, but there is effectively one user.
