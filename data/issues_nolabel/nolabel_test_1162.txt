Inconsistent Naming with different input shapes

Install from binary pip package

Which pip package you installed. CPU only for Linux
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)": 0.7.0

Steps to reproduce
Run the following code:
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='haha', shape=[128, 20, 20, 20])
c = tf.nn.moments(a, axes=[0])[0]
print c.name

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='haha', shape=[None, 20, 20, 20])
    c = tf.nn.moments(a, axes=[0])[0]
    print c.name

It prints:
moments/Squeeze:0
moments/Squeeze_1:0

In short, with different input shapes, the op returns a variable with different names.
I'm not sure whether this is expected to happen, or something to be fixed. IMHO, this could cause some problems because one may use a fixed batch size for training, and a None batch size for inference. Getting a different name make it harder to manage variable load & restore.
