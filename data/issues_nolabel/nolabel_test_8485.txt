AOT compilation doesn't work on MacOS

I was trying to reproduce this example on how to use AOT compilation. My graph is made by calling make_test_graphs.py and I used test_graph_tfmatmul.config.pbtxt as my config file. I failed at 'Step 2: Use tf_library build macro to compile the subgraph'.
Here is the error message:
error:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/libtool: file: bazel-out/local-opt/genfiles/test_aot/test_graph_tfmatmul.o is not an object file (not allowed in a library)
However, if I bazel build the same tf_library on a GCE instance, it compiles successfully. The only difference is that the Tensorflow on my GCE instance is cuda enabled. I think there may be a bug in AOT compilation in CPU-only mode.
Environment info
Operating System: macOS 10.12
Processor: intel 'haswell'.
Tensorflow version: 1.0.1 stable release
bazel version: 0.4.4
