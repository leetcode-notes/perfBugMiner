dropout does not take in dynamic shape

I realize dropout noise_shape does not allow dynamic shape which becomes useless in batch processing whereby the batchsize can varies
X = tf.placeholder('float', [None, 5, 10])
tf.dropout(X, keep_prob=0.5, noise_shape=[-1, 5, 1]) 
throws Exception. Whereby it requires dimension to be >= 0
however if we pass noise_shape as the shape of X which is dynamic, dropout can understand the shape.
tf.dropout(X, keep_prob=0.5, noise_shape=tf.shape(X))
Therefore there is inconsistency in noise_shape inputs. How do we give dynamic shapes to noise_shape such as noise_shape=[-1, 5, 1] where the batchsize dimension can be variable just like how tf.reshape works
tf.reshape(X, [-1, 5, 1])
