Tensor Forest regression

I was not able to find any documentation for Tensor Forest, however from the comment on line 90 in tensor_forest.py it seems to follow that it is intended for regression as well as classification. However it does not accept floats as labels.
The following code:
params = tensor_forest.ForestHParams(num_classes=1, num_features=features, num_trees=10, max_nodes=1000).fill()
graph_builder = tensor_forest.RandomForestGraphs(params)
graph = graph_builder.training_graph(X, y)
Returns a value error:
TypeError: Input 'input_labels' of 'CountExtremelyRandomStats' Op has type float32 that does not match expected type of int32.
