Possible memory leak with TensorArray

I'm not sure if the usage is incorrect (see below), but I am seeing a memory leak in cpu ram when using the TensorArray. Seems to be consistent regardless of device placement. I noticed this because I've been using the dynamic_rnn.  Happy to provide further info if needed.

Steps to reproduce
Run this in a script  (I had to add from tensorflow.python.ops import tensor_array_ops to tensorflow/python/__init__.py)
import tensorflow as tf

def ta_mem_leak():

    ta = tf.python.tensor_array_ops.TensorArray(
                        dtype=tf.float32, size=10000)
    ta = ta.write(0, [0.])
    final_outputs = ta.read(0)
    return [final_outputs]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with tf.Graph().as_default(), tf.Session() as session:
        ops = ta_mem_leak()
        for i in xrange(200000):
            res = session.run(ops)
