Add support for pyx_library in the open-source build.

I have a model that has a lot of big constant Tensors (2048x2048), and building the graph is extremely slow. After profiling my code, I see that the bottlenecks are the functions SlowAppend<TYPE>ArrayToTensorProto  defined in tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py which take 98% of the time.
Reviewing the source code I see the following lines:
# TODO(opensource): Add support for pyx_library in the open-source build.
# For now, we use the slow versions that fast_tensor_util replaces.
# pylint: disable=g-import-not-at-top

So I was wondering if it is planned to add this feature in the short term, and if not, any advice on how to speed up the graph building process?
Thanks
