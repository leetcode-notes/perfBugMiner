TF0.12  NewCheckpointReader() Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor

I am using Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.
I recently switched from TF r0.10 to TF r0.12. With TF r0.12, NewCheckpointReader('name.ckpt') gives error 'Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor'. The files: 'name.ckpt.meta', 'name.ckpt.index' and 'name.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001' exist (as produced by the saver object).
In TF 0.10, the saver was producing  the file 'name.ckpt' that I could read using NewCheckpointReader('name.ckpt'). This does not seem to work in TF r0.12. In TF r0.12, the python documentation says to use: tf.train.NewCheckpointReader(filepattern), but I cannot find any
detail about filepattern  (tried something obvious, but I could not make it work).
Is this a bug ? If not, could somebody explain what is a filepattern  (corresponding to 'name.ckpt') in TF r0.12 ?
Issue #751 seems similar to this one, but it is different as  that is related to the saver, rather than to NewCheckPointReader()
Thank you
