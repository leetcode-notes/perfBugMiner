Describe the problem
Feature request:  OutputProjectionWrappers for use with tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn.  I don't think this is a bug report, per se, because I don't think the wrapper was designed for Bidirectional RNNs.
tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn wants a forward and backward RNN cell, and provides a tuple of tuples:  forward and backward outputs, forward and backward output_states.
The outputProjectionWrapper just wants a cell as input, and returns another cell as an output.
So while we can wrap both the forward and backward layers in their own outputProjectionWrappers and send those on to tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn -- syntactically, it works -- it's not at all what we want conceptually.  All we've done is project the forward and backward layers independently.
