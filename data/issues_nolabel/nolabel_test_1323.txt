BasicLSTMCell cannot calculate output shape correctly when batchsize is 1

I found that BasicLSTMCell cannot infer output shape correctly when the input batchsize is 1, after my graph construction failed within this case.
Tensorflow version: 0.7.1, installed with pip. Operating system: Ubuntu 14.04
Minimum code snip to reproduce:
import tensorflow as tf

batchsize = 1
# batchsize = 2
D_in, D_out = 1000, 2000

input_ = tf.zeros([batchsize, D_in], tf.float32)
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(D_out)
state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batchsize, tf.float32)

output, _ = lstm_cell(input_, state)
print(output.get_shape().as_list())

When batchsize = 2, the shape of output is [2, 2000], with the first dimension equal to batchsize. However, when batchsize = 1, the shape of output is [None, 2000] instead of [1, 2000].
I'm not sure why the output shape is not correctly inferred as [1, 2000] when batchsize = 1. Could someone please have a look?
