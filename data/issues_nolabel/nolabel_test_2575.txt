Steps to reproduce
I am using TensorFlow to implement a network that needs to use tf.while_loop()
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
class model(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.argmax_ep_gate_array = [ tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None]) for _ in range(10)]
        argmax_ep_gate_array_concat = tf.concat(0, self.argmax_ep_gate_array)
        story_len = tf.constant(7)
        starter = tf.constant(0)
        z = []
        def body(hops):
            hops = tf.add(hops,1)
            z.append(hops)
            return hops
        def condition(hops):
            return tf.logical_and(tf.less(tf.gather(argmax_ep_gate_array_concat, hops),story_len),tf.less(hops,tf.constant(20)))

        self.gate_index = tf.while_loop(condition,body,[starter])
        self.z=tf.concat(0,z)

    def step(self, sess):
        feed={}
        for i in range(10):
            feed[self.argmax_ep_gate_array[i].name]=[i]
        print (sess.run([self.gate_index,self.z],feed))
with tf.Session() as sess:
    while_loop = model()
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
    while_loop.step(sess)


What have you tried?
I find that If I want to sess.run() any variable in the body() that is not returned, tensorflow would stuck into endless loop.
The above example is trivial, but it reveals something. In the real case, I am using tf.while_loop() running a RNN which includes y= wx+b something like that, but the w and b are not returned after while loop. In the forward network, it works fine. However, if I run the back propagation, the program would stuck into endless loop. I suppose the code above reproducing my issue, because back propagation do need to modify w and b. Or is there any way to handle this issue?
Logs or other output that would be helpful

No logs, Just stuck into endless loop
