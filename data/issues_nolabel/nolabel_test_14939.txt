Add complex dtypes support for `tf.squared_difference`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #14932 where complex dtypes are not supported for tf.squared_difference, which is different from the doc string in math_ops.cc (see BINARY_FEWER).
This fix adds the complex64 and complex128 support in kernel, and adds additional test cases.
This fix fixes #14932.
