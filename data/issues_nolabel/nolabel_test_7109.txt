error training LSTM image captioning model using dynamic_rnn

Hello,
I am trying to use tf.nn.dynamic_rnn to train an image captioning model. However, I keep getting this error.
ValueError: Variable lstm//BasicLSTMCell/Linear/Matrix does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?

I am using Tensorflow version 0.12.1
Here is the code snippet:
 lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=self.config.num_lstm_units, state_is_tuple=True)
 if self.mode == "train":
 lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper(
    lstm_cell,
    input_keep_prob=self.config.lstm_dropout_keep_prob,
    output_keep_prob=self.config.lstm_dropout_keep_prob)

with tf.variable_scope("lstm", initializer=self.initializer) as lstm_scope:
     zero_state = initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(
                  batch_size=self.seq_embeddings.get_shape()[0], dtype=tf.float32)

    lstm_scope.reuse_variables()  
    sequence_length = tf.reduce_sum(self.input_mask, 1)
    lstm_outputs, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=lstm_cell,
                                    inputs=self.seq_embeddings,
                                    sequence_length=sequence_length,
                                    initial_state=initial_state,
                                    dtype=tf.float32,
                                    scope=lstm_scope
                                    )
