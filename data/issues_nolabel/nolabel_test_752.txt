Using a model (post training)

I've trained a simple model of my own in python, categorizing images into two categories (Imagenet apples, vs imagenet oranges). I'm looking to now evaluate arbitrary images using this model to get a prediction (apples v oranges) and I'm having trouble finding out the right way to do that for some reason.
At the moment I'm just using a random training image for simplicity.
# Use the existing graph and grab a sample image from the valid dataset.
tf_image = tf_valid_dataset[1001,:,:,:] 
result = tf.Session(graph=graph).run(tf_image)
I was trying to look at some of the API docs and the C++ imagenet example as inspiration, but I think I'm off track. result ends up being tf_image it seems.
I know that I want the result of a single forward pass, but having a hard time seeing the right way to get that.
