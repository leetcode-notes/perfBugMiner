Support a separate namespace for the protobuf library

Some clients are already using protobuf v2 as part of their application and would need a lot of work to move, but TensorFlow requires v3. This script patches the protobuf source code after downloading it to put it into a google::protobuf3 namespace, and alters all the necessary TensorFlow code to compile with this new namespace. This allows the v3 library to be linked into applications alongside v2 without causing linker errors.
