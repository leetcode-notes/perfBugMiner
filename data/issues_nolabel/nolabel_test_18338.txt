SeparableConv2D from tf.keras.layers and tf.layers gives different results

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version: 3.6.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: See source code

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
The shape of the weight matrices of a SeparableConv2D using tf.keras.layers and tf.layers is different even when using the same arguments. It looks like the SeparableConv2D class from tf.keras.layers is ignoring the depth_multiplier argument.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

sep_conv1 = tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=2, strides=1, padding='same', depth_multiplier=5)
sep_conv2 = tf.layers.SeparableConv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=2, strides=1, padding='same', depth_multiplier=5)

x = tf.random_uniform((1, 4, 4, 3), minval=1, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
x = tf.cast(x, tf.float32)

y1 = sep_conv1(x)
y2 = sep_conv2(x)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(init)
sess.run([y1, y2])

# the shape of the depthwise_kernel is (2, 2, 3, 1) and the shape of the pointwise_kernel is (1, 1, 3, 2)
for w in sep_conv1.variables:
    print(w)

# the shape of the depthwise_kernel is (2, 2, 3, 5) and the shape of the pointwise_kernel is (1, 1, 15, 2)
for w in sep_conv2.variables:
    print(w)
