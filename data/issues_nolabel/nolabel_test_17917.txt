Bazel build FAILED on Ubuntu16.04 caused by extension file to detect MSVC for Windows

When using BAZEL to build TF r.17 from source on Ubuntu16.04. It failed caused by the bazel extension file located at /tensorflow/tools/def_file_filter/def_file_filter_configure.bzl, which is used to export symbols from TF DLL file for Windows. The same problem occurs for building TF-Lite also.
Commend:

bazel build --config=opt  //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel build --config=opt   //tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco:toco

Bazel output:
