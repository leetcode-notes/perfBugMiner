Hi, I run my generative model and evaluate the inception score of the generated images every now and then and encountered out of memory after a lot of iterations. I don't know what the cause is since I built the graph and just feed some values to it.
My code goes as follows:
session=tf.InteractiveSession()

inception_samples = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[INCEPTION_BATCHES*BATCH_SIZE, DATA_DIM])

def get_inception_score_op(inception_samples=inception_samples):
    inception_samples=tf.reshape(inception_samples,[BATCH_SIZE*INCEPTION_BATCHES,NUM_CHANNELS,HEIGHT,WIDTH])
    inception_samples=tf.transpose(inception_samples,[0,2,3,1])
    return lib.classifier_score.get_inception_scores(\
    inception_samples,batch_size=BATCH_SIZE*INCEPTION_BATCHES, num_inception_images=BATCH_SIZE)

inception_score=get_inception_score_op()

def get_inception_score():
    all_samples = []
    for i in xrange(INCEPTION_BATCHES):# inception score for num_batches of fake data
        all_samples.append(session.run(fake_sample))     
    all_samples = np.concatenate(all_samples, axis=0)
    return inception_score.eval({inception_samples:all_samples})
for i in range(ITERATIONS):
    print get_inception_score()

where  "lib.classifier_score.get_inception_scores" is from the file
# https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/gan/cifar/util.py
that looks like this:
tfgan = tf.contrib.gan

def get_inception_scores(images, batch_size, num_inception_images):
  """Get Inception score for some images.

  Args:
    images: Image minibatch. Shape [batch size, width, height, channels]. Values
      are in [-1, 1].
    batch_size: Python integer. Batch dimension.
    num_inception_images: Number of images to run through Inception at once.

  Returns:
    Inception scores. Tensor shape is [batch size].

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `batch_size` is incompatible with the first dimension of
      `images`.
    ValueError: If `batch_size` isn't divisible by `num_inception_images`.
  """
  # Validate inputs.
  assert images.shape[-1]==3
  tf.TensorShape(images.shape)[0:1].assert_is_compatible_with([batch_size])
  if batch_size % num_inception_images != 0:
    raise ValueError(
        '`batch_size` must be divisible by `num_inception_images`.')

  # Resize images.
  size = 299
  resized_images = tf.image.resize_bilinear(images, [size, size])

  # Run images through Inception.
  num_batches = batch_size // num_inception_images
  inc_score = tfgan.eval.inception_score(
      resized_images, num_batches=num_batches)

  return inc_score

except that I made some minor changes to it.
I guess tf.contrib.gan.eval.inception_score() have been taking up my GPU memory.
