Tensorflow gemmlowp preformance

I ran the tensorflow android demo on android with the google inception model. I used the quantized model transformed from tools/quantize_graph but  was sad to found that the gemmlowp works worse than float Eigen convolution on Android. Any suggestions to this , thanks a lot.
