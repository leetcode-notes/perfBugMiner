Make curl forward/backward compatible

I'm working on fixing bazelbuild/bazel#1262, which will change the way Bazel organizes the execution root.  The curl library needs to use ../curl as an include prefix in new versions of Bazel and external/curl in old versions.
This patch should be forward/backward compatible.
