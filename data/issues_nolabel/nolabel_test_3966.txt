Add cuda_configure repository rule to autodetect cuda.

This change reimplements the CUDA autoconfiguration mechanism in Skylark,
providing a cuda_configure workspace rule. We keep the same user interface,
the ./configure script, but rather than modifying source files within the
source tree, cuda_configure generates a @local_config_cuda workspace
containing:

Symlinks to the CUDA headers and libraries
BUILD files generated with the correct CUDA and cuDNN versions
CROSSTOOL config with CUDA include dirs populated
crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc wrapper script with compiler paths and
CUDA compute capabilities set.
cuda_config.h header file with CUDA versions and compute capabilities set,
which can be #included by source files.

This change also makes the following fixes to Dockerfile.gpu:

Change the CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH to point to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
rather than /usr/local/cuda since NVIDIA's image installs libcudnn.so
under /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu.
Add env variable to set the minimum compute capability to 3.0.
