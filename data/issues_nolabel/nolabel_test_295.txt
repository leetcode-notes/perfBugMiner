Better docs for node methods

I see that nodes / tensors have a number of available methods, like eval and get_shape, which are very useful for interrogating the graph in interactive sessions for debugging and such. But as far as I can tell they're not really documented anyway. Seems like very useful features that are worth drawing attention to.
