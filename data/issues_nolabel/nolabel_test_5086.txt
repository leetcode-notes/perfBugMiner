Some workers doesn't exist when training in distributed mode

We have tried distributed TensorFlow and it works for training. But sometimes only some workers will execute the code and exit after training. Sometimes all workers will exit finally with the same code.
The code of distributed TensorFlow application is here. Is that a bug or can anyone explain why?
