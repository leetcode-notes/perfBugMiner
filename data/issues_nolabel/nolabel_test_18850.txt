Mac OS X Python 3.5 binary runtime warning for Tensorflow 1.5.0+

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.13.4
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (or whatever pip is)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0+
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: 8GB CPU
Exact command to reproduce: python -c "import tensorflow"

Describe the problem
I seem to have the opposite problem of #14182
I'm using Python 3.5, but when I try to use a Tensorflow version 1.5 or above with the command
python -c "import tensorflow"

I get a RuntimeWarning saying:
/Users/<user>/.pyenv/versions/3.5.3/lib/python3.5/importlib/_bootstrap.py:222: RuntimeWarning: 
compiletime version 3.6 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match 
runtime version 3.5
  return f(*args, **kwds)

When I install using pip install tensorflow==1.5.0, it installs from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b1/57/1d27695a4572d70b8cd365dd358b45a41ece811d675910e175254779885e/tensorflow-1.5.0-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl
Installing with pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.5.0-py3-none-any.whl doesn't make the warning go away either.
I get this warning for any Tensorflow version 1.5.0 and above. Incidentally, 1.5.0 is where the runtime binary for Python 3.6 was fixed, so I'm wondering if this is related. I have no issues when installing Tensorflow 1.5.0+ on Ubuntu 16.04 with pip install tensorflow with Python 3.5.2 so it seems to be a Mac OS X problem.
Source code / logs
I get the warning whenever I run import tensorflow
