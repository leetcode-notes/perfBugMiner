1.8rc1 cherry-pick request: [tf.data] Fix a device placement issue in `prefetch_to_device()`.

Cherry pick #18607 to the r1.8 branch.
The tf.contrib.data.prefetch_to_device() utility was broken when using GPUs (its primary use case), as first noticed on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/q/49876643/3574081 . If this cherry-pick is not included, the feature promised for 1.8 at the Dev Summit will not be available to use in the release.
