Problem about 'placeholder' function

I installed Tensorflow using Pip in Vmware Simulation Machine Ubuntu Operation System with only CPU Evn.
When I used tensorflow in python 2.7:



import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(name="x")



I met one error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
TypeError: placeholder() takes at least 1 argument (1 given)
