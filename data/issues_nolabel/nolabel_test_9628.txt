Describe the problem
When I use tf.cond, both f1 and f2 are executed.
Source code / logs
sess = tf.Session()
x = tf.constant(7)
y = tf.constant(5)
lst = []
def f1():
    global lst
    lst.append(x)
    return x
def f2(): 
    global lst
    lst.append(y)
    return y
r = tf.cond(tf.less(x, y), f1, f2)
print(sess.run(lst))  #return [7,5], which means lst.append(x) and lst.append(y) are both executed
