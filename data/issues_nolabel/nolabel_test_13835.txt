Feature query: How to load the graph(model) only once and then give series of inputs

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No. Running the Simple Audio recognition network tutorial
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
-TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.0

Describe the problem
I am a tensorflow and neural network novice. I was able to run the Simple audio recognition network. For a given input wavefile the model obtained gives the result in approx. 5 seconds. I want reduce this time to 100s of milliseconds. From the issue #11618, there seems to be a way to do this using the graph.
I used the graph optimisation tool but there wasn't a considerable reduction in time.I heard that loading the graph is what takes time and hence I need to figure out how to load the graph only once and then feed the inputs without feeding all the parameters every time a new input needs to be tested.
The command that is used for decoding is as follows:
python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/label_wav.py 
--graph=/tmp/my_frozen_graph.pb 
--labels=/tmp/speech_commands_train/conv_labels.txt 
--wav=/tmp/speech_dataset/left/a5d485dc_nohash_0.wav
Also does anyone know if there is official data on how long alexa/google home take to respond to trigger words?
