Where can I find c++ head file "tensorflow/cc/ops/sparse_ops.h"

I want to use the sparse tensor in C++ API(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/add-sparse-to-tensors-map).
But when I search in "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", there is no "tensorflow/cc/ops/sparse_ops.h"
Does anyone know how to use the sparse tensor in C++?
