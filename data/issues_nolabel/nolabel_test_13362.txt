Trying to run 2_fullyconnected.ipynb but neural net doesn't learn

I'm trying to run that notebook as it is but model doesn't learn at all. Initially I got right results like in sample but now I'm instantly getting such output when train a multinomial logistic regression using simple gradient descent:

When I switch to switch to stochastic gradient descent training I get simmilar output. Restarting kernel and even VM doesn't work. I also tried to delete preveously generated pickle and generate it from scratch but it also doesn't help.
What might cause my neural net to stop learning at some point?
