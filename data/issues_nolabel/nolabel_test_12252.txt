Cannot use mean_absolute_error

I made a very simple neural network on tf and I wanted to use mean absolute error loss function, however I got this error right after I created the optimizer:
No gradients provided for any variable, check your graph for ops that do not support gradients, between variables [...] and loss Tensor(...)
This is what I did:
cost = tf.metrics.mean_absolute_error(pred, y)[0]
optimizer = tf.train.AdadeltaOptimizer(learning_rate=learning_rate).minimize(cost)

I tried another loss function and it worked. In fact, I read that it's difficult to provide a gradient when the absolute value is involved, but I did exactly the same in Keras and it works. In fact, I also did the following (which is basically the mean absolute error) and it works as well!
cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(tf.subtract(pred, y)))
optimizer = tf.train.AdadeltaOptimizer(learning_rate=learning_rate).minimize(cost)

Why the function doesn't work?
