Fix KeyError in quantize_graph round, quantize opt

The round/quantize paths check for a boolean value in a dictionary before it is set, leading to a KeyError. This change allows the input graph to be quantized using the 'round' and 'quantize' options. The quantized graph can't actually be used (for the 'round' option, at least) due to a lack of a RoundToSteps Op, but I figured I'd submit this anyway.
Pinging @petewarden for thoughts on whether this is worth incorporating now.
