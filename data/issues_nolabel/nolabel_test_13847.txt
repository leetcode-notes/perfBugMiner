tf.train.batch and shuffle_batch undetermined for multi queue input with multiple threads

System information

OSX


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
pip install tensorflow == 1.2


TensorFlow version (use command below):
('v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d', '1.2.0')


Python version:
Python 2.7.10


Bazel version (if compiling from source):

Exact command to reproduce:


a_fifo = tf.train.slice_input_producer([np.arange(30)],
                                        shuffle=False,
                                        name='a')[0]
b_fifo = tf.train.slice_input_producer([np.arange(30)],
                                        shuffle=False,
                                        name='b')[0]
train_batch = tf.train.batch([a_fifo, b_fifo],
                            batch_size=5,
                            capacity=18,
                            num_threads=2,
                            name='batch')
at, bt = train_batch
with tf.Session() as sess:
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess)
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    try:
        for i in range(150):
            av, bv = sess.run([at, bt])
            assert list(av) == list(bv), "queues derailed!"
    except Exception as e:
        print(("Exception in training: {}").format(e))
        print("__",i,"__")
        print(av)
        print(bv)

Output:

Exception in training: queues derailed!
__ 11 __
[26 25 27 28 29]
[25 26 27 28 29]

Describe the problem
Both queues should be dequeued synchronously, as it does when num_threads =1 in the batch statement. With num_threads > 1 the two input queue's will derail, as shown in the example above. Same issue appears also in train.shuffle_batch.
