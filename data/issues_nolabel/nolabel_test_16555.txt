LSTMBlockFusedCell#call no longer supports list of tensors

Describe the problem
Documentation says, "inputs: 3-D tensor with shape [time_len, batch_size, input_size] or a list of time_len tensors of shape [batch_size, input_size]". However, as of 1.5.0, this call only works with a 3-D tensor.
Source code / logs
When attempting to run with a list of 2-D tensors, I get the following:
