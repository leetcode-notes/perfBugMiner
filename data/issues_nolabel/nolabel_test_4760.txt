Check failed: stream->parent()->GetConvolveAlgorithms(&algorithms)

I've the following error. I'm using a conda installation of tensorflow. I'm struggling to try to use it with my GPU.
Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 5005 (compatibility version 5000) but source was compiled with 5103 (compatibility version 5100).  If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime matches a compatible version specified during compile configuration.
F tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc:526] Check failed: stream->parent()->GetConvolveAlgorithms(&algorithms)
Aborted (core dumped)

which nvcc returns
/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin/nvcc
nvcc version returns
Cuda compilation tools, release 7.5, V7.5.17
I tried downloading CuDNN v5.1 and did the following but it didn't work either
sudo cp lib* /usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64/
sudo cp include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-7.5/include/
sudo ldconfig


I tried on the other folder too
sudo cp lib* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
sudo cp include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/
sudo ldconfig
