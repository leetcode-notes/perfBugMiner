Unable to run cifar10_multi_gpu_train as is in TensorFlow master

Ubuntu 14.04
commit used: a154b6a
Simply changed num_gpus to 2. I have 2 GPUs. A 1060 and 970. Shows this error:
ValueError: Variable tower_1/tower_1/conv1/weight_loss/avg/biased does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
