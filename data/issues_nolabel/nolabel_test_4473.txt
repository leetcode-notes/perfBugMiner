Make the gradient computation available in the C api

When writing TensorFlow bindings for other languages, a major difficulty is that the C api does not give a simple way to add gradient computations to a graph. In the case of the tensorflow-ocaml bindings, we ended up re-implementing back-propagation and having to register gradients for many operators. Providing support for this in the C api would allow us to remove all this code.
There is already a todo for this in the code but having a proper issue would make this easier to track.
