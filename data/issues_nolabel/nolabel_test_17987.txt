graph.pb.h missing in cc tutorial

In tensorflow > cc > tutorials >>graph.pb.h , the code includes the header file graph.pb.h . However in the path it specifies (tensorflow/core/framework/) there is no such file.
Where is this header file located? I could not find it inside the tensorflow master branch.
