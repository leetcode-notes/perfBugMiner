ImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Here is what happens when I try to import tensorflow. I installed using the compile from source method for Linux GPU. This is on Ubuntu 14.04. The file that it says there is no such file or directory is in the path file that I have listed. I've tried searching for help to no avail.
(I apologize if this doesn't make a lot of sense. Inexperience, sleep-deprivation, and frustration are the main contributors to my inability to communicate clearly at the moment.)
