How to use the output of the graph as a parameter of the loss function

Is there any example about using the output of the graph as a parameter of the loss function?
For example:
,,summary_str_train, acc_train = sess.run([train_step, cross_entropy, merged_summary_op, accuracy], feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y: batch_ys, keep_prob: 0.7})
acc_train is the accuracy of the current minibatch, output of the graph, I want to use the value of the acc_train in the loss function? the cross_entropy_loss is a customized function.
cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy_loss(logits=prediction, one_hot_labels=y, accuracy=acc_train))
Is there any example about this? Thanks
