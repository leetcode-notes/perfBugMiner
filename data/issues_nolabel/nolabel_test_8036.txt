Could LSTM model be used to predict from multivariate variables

I am doing a project on water content predictions. The input variables on time series include temperature, rainfall and so on. I do not know whether LSTM can predict from multiple variables or not. And I do not know how to do it? Could anybody please help me and provide such a related example? Thank you very much.
