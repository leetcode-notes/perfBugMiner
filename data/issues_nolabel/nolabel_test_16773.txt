TensorBoard: Fit domain to data in 1.5 under Windows cuts off max values

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Using TensorBoard in custom U-Net implementation
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.0, CuDNN 7
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB), 32 GB RAM
Exact command to reproduce: tensorboard with tf.summary.scalar

Describe the problem
After updating from 1.4 to 1.5 I have the problems that the y-scale for the scalar graphs in TensorBoard seems to be misscalculated. The maximum values are not included in the shown graph, they are cut off.
