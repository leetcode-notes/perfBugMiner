Why not feed placeholders by name?

I couldn't find anything in the documentation on this. Is it possible to feed placeholders by name? If not, why? I think this would be useful to feed graphs after loading them from disk.
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None,), 'x')
y = tf.reduce_sum(x)
sess = tf.Session()

sess.run(y, {x: [1, 2, 3]}
# > 6.0

sess.run(y, {'x': [1, 2, 3]}
# > Cannot interpret feed_dict key as Tensor: The name 'x' refers to an operation,
# > not a Tensor. Tensor names must be of the form "<op_name>:<output_index>".

sess.run(y, {tf.get_default_graph().get_operation_by_name('x').outputs[0]: [1, 2, 3]})
# > 6.0
