Upgrade Protobuf

We are building TensorFlow master using bazel on 64 bit platform.
We need a fix for 64 bit platform as mentioned in #1044 in tensorflow/third_party/protobuf/3.0.0/src/google/protobuf/stubs/atomicops_internals_generic_gcc.h.
This fix is available in protobuf with commit id c59473d or higher.
Will it be possible to pick this or higher commit of protobuf in TensorFlow?
