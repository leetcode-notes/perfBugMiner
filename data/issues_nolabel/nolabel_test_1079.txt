Compiling against Cuda compute environment 3.0 causes TF to take huge virtual memory

I run tensorflow program with htop in another terminal. Standard installation for cpu or gpu doesn't take more than half a GB of virtual memory. If I compile from source, using
TF_UNOFFICIAL_SETTING=1 ./configure
and using cuda compute environment 3.0 (not 3.5 or 5.2) then the same program uses 38GB of virtual memory. I don't understand cuda well enough to postulate why this would be. It's not a huge problem unless you have lots of them running at once.
I only do this bc I want to work on AWS GPU instance and they only have K520 or something like that.
