help with classifier.predict and predicted_classes

System information

custom code: no, it is the one in https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator
system: Apple
OS: Mac OsX 10.13
TensorFlow version: 1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.3
GPU model: AMD FirePro D700 (actually, two such GPUs)

Describe the problem
Dear all,
I am running the simple iris program:
https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator
under python 3.6.3 and tensorflow 1.3.0.
The program executes correctly, apart from the very last part, i.e. the one related to the confusion matrix.
In fact, the result I get for the confusion matrix is:
New Samples, Class Predictions:    [array([b'1'], dtype=object), array([b'2'], dtype=object)]
rather than the expected output:
New Samples, Class Predictions:    [1 2]
Has anything about confusion matrix changed in the latest release?
If so, how should I modify that part of the code?
Thank you very much for your help!
Best regards
Ivan
