TensorBoard not finding files to display, suggested solution?

It seems that the default location for the log files, for most tutorials is in the system root tmp directory.. eg /tmp. This directory cannot normally be found by starting the tensorboard program according to instructions, nor do the debug instructions on the readme page for Tensorboard help at all.. Since they: Grep/ starting in debug Mode etc.. also depend on seeing directories within the user space.
I'd suggest simply modifying the tutorials to add the ./tmp so that the files end up in user space and also that the tensorBoard start up default directory be configured to match, only requiring configuration when needed for larger and more complex installs.
