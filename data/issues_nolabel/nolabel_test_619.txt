TENSOR-566: Fix for verbose messaging

After doing a bit of digging on various logging.h used in tensorflow, while some provide facility of silencing logs via LogSilencer and some use re2 package with flags like FLAGS_minlogLevel, the flow for local_device.cc and direct_session.cc only hit the core platform default logging (tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h) which neither has facility to silence log nor is capable of interpreting command line flag setting. One way is to make it verbose logging at level 1 for these messages are truly not messages a user needs to know  every time, but only if interested.Please review and let me know if this is ok.Also long term if there is log suppressing on this flow.thanks.
