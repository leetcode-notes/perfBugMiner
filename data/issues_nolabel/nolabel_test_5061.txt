Feature Request - expose protobuf on syntaxnet as 'first class' interface

Clearly syntaxnet will parse sentences out of the box to a terminal with / without CoNLL format.
echo I saw the dude with glasses|./syntaxnet/demo.sh

I'm using a tensorflow in docker container - and now I want to interface to it from some other software via an api. I'd like to use some server side swift code.
I spent time looking at following (parsey flask wrapper)
https://github.com/JoshData/parsey-mcparseface-server
(parsey django wrapper)
https://github.com/dan-nadler/ParseyAPI
and https://github.com/dmansfield/parsey-mcparseface-api
The last repo exposes parsey via protobufs -
https://github.com/dmansfield/parsey-mcparseface-api/blob/160f3cbb5f96eff5fb8b73624228ceb7c8208b71/parsey_api/parsey_api.proto
using tensorflow serving but he had to fork the project and patch the files.
While there's been help from other engineers to assist to get project working
dmansfield/parsey-mcparseface-api#1
I suggest supporting protobufs out of the box as an api
