TypeError: Input 'split_dim' of 'Split' Op has type float32

Hi,
I use Tensorflow 1.5.0rc0  on windows (Python 3.5.2 )and I have this issue:
TypeError: Input 'split_dim' of 'Split' Op has type float32 that does not match expected type of int32. I have seen some answers for older versions of tensor flow but is there any fix for the new version?
