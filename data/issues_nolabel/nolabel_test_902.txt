Use the same types in `for` statements.

This removes lots of simple compiler warnings on 'signed' and 'unsigned'
comparisons (reported in #128). Please note that there are two types of
changes. It is because this does not change any function signatures.

In most cases: int --> size_t.
In lookup_table_op.cc, string_to_number_op.cc, and
sparse_tensor.h: size_t --> int.
