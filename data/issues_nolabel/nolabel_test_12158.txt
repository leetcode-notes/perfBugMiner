Is `full_matrices=False` working for `tf.svd()`?

I am working with tensorflow svd decomposition,  and I notice that the svd results do not have any differences for singular matrix no matter I set full_matrices=False or to be True. For example,
a = tf.Variable([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 4.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]])  # Singular Matrix
s, u, v = tf.svd(a, full_matrices=False)
init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init_op)
sess.run([s, u, v])

The results are always same no matter full_matrices=False or True. However, the online doc says "If true, compute full-sized u and v. If false (the default), compute only the leading P singular vectors". So I wonder if there is a bug for this argument. Thanks!
