Consoles freezes while reading an image.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
image_filename = "/home/kaiyin/PycharmProjects/tensorflow-for-machine-intelligence/images/chapter-05-object-recognition-and-classification/working-with-images/test-input-image.jpg"
filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(tf.train.match_filenames_once(image_filename))
image_reader = tf.WholeFileReader()
_, image_file = image_reader.read(filename_queue)
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_file)
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
sess.run(image)
Also tried the non-interactive session:
import tensorflow as tf
with tf.Session() as sess:
    image_filename = "/home/kaiyin/PycharmProjects/tensorflow-for-machine-intelligence/images/chapter-05-object-recognition-and-classification/working-with-images/test-input-image.jpg"
    filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(tf.train.match_filenames_once(image_filename))
    image_reader = tf.WholeFileReader()
    _, image_file = image_reader.read(filename_queue)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_file)
    sess.run(image)
