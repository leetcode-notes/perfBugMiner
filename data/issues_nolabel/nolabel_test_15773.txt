Describe the problem
I'm currently implementing a pose estimation system and I defined my network with 3 loss and train_op in each of degree, yaw, pitch and roll. And I'm current using your tf.estimator API which I think is pretty convenient to monitor the system, however I found that I may only be able to define one loss and train_op using this set of API. I would like to know if there is any solution to train and monitor the system with multiple loss and train_op at the same time. Thanks.

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
        mode=mode,
        predictions=predictions,
        loss=[yaw_total_loss, pitch_total_loss, roll_total_loss],  # error
        train_op=[yaw_train_op, pitch_train_op, roll_train_op],  # error
        eval_metric_ops=None)
