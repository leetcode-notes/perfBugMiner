Why is --whole-archive neccesary when building with the session api?

Environment info
Operating System:
Linux version 4.8.0-rc1-ga0cba21
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Building a project using the C++ session API fails without the --whole-archive option but this slows down the linking process immensely and the output binaries are huge (by embedded systems standards). Why can't the linker link this archive normally?
