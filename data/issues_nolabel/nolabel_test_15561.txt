_Assert3DImage that adds a control dependency for the shape check.

I noticed that the _Check3DImage was always used in exactly the same way and extracted this into its own convenience function.
The only remaining use of _Check3DImage was an import in gen_image_ops.py saying
"# TODO(drpng): remove these once internal use has discontinued.", so maybe it could be removed entirely.
