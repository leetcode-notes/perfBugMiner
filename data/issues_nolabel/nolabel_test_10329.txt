Problem exporting the weight matrix for each layer along with all the hyper parameters of each layer and their connectivity.

Describe the problem
How do you extract the weights of each of the intermediate layers in tensorflow?  I use the /tmp/cifar-train but I couldn't find the exact location of the weight matrix along with the hyper parameters?

I see the following files above but there is no documentation that tells how to export the weight matrix along with the hyper parameters for the entire network and each layer for the exact configuration.
