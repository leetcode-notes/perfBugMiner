TensorFlow-GPU random GPU crashes while training

System information

Custom code - Simple q learning model using Keras with TF and Open AI Gym
Windows 10
Tensorflow installed with pip
TensorFlow-gpu 1.7.0
Python 3.6.4
CUDA 9.0, cuDNN 7
Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GDDR5 4GB

Describtion
When I'm running a script randomly two types of errors happen:

Blue Screen with Driver Power State Failure
TensorFlow cannot locate gpu " failed call to cuInit: CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE"

This happens approximately once per 10 runs. GeForce is my secondary gpu card, so I assume, that it is not related to watchdog timer.
