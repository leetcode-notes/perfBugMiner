Add option to not include histograms

add_gan_model_image_summaries does the work of adding images to summaries, but then it also calls add_gan_model_summaries which dumps every trainable variable to histograms. It would be nice to be able to get the image summaries without the histograms.
I would prefer to just delete that line, because it is weird that the two functions are tied. It wouldn't be hard to call both functions in your code if you wanted both.
However, this preserves existing functionality. If you pass model_summaries=False, it does not call add_gan_model_summaries.
