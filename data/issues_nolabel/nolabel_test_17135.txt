Inconsistency on the Dataset document

Describe the problem
There are some inconsistencies in the document about Dataset.
Problem 1
In https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/premade_estimators, i.e. the link to the most recent stable release (v1.5 for now), in "Getting the sample code" section, there is something that reads:

The program described in this document is premade_estimator.py. This program uses iris_data.py To fetch its training data.

The links of premade_estimator.py and iris_data.py in the above sentence are to the master branch, instead of the branch corresponding to the correct version. It is not a good idea to point to the master branch because:
If you follow the link of  iris_data.py, you can see https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/iris_data.py#L39
return dataset which is not the same as the return dataset.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next() in the document. This confuses the users.
To fix this, I would suggest to change the script that generates the web page to automatically generate links pointing to the correct github tag.
Problem 2
In https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/premade_estimators
i.e. the "Getting Started with TensorFlow" for the master branch,  the example code has already been changed to return a Dataset, which is consistent with https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/iris_data.py#L39
This is good here.
But in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/datasets_quickstart
the sample code still returns dataset.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next()
I would suggest making it consistent by returning a Dataset in the above code.  And if needed, consider adding something like:

Since version 1.5, Estimator now supports Dataset: input_fn to return a Dataset instead of Tensors. So return dataset.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next() can be simplified to return dataset
