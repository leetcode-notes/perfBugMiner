1.3.0rc0 GPU Windows Binaries are broken.

UPDATE: This is most likely due to the new cuDNN requirement not being specified. Users stumbling across this issue should check what cuDNN version they have installed as 1.3 binaries are built with cuDNN v6.
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Win10-64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0rc0 GPU
Python version: 3.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8/5.1
GPU model and memory: k40 12gb
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

Describe the problem
Only tried GPU versions
Despite what the release config matrix says here: https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Release/job/release-win/lastBuild/ it appears that the binaries (pip and from ci) for 1.3.0rc0 do not work on windows. Each time will return the pywrap/DLL error etc. Checked with @mrry check script and everything is ok. Tried with python 3.5 and 3.6. 1.2.1 works on both those python versions just fine. I noticed that the 3.5 build for win-gpu was failing but jenkins reckons 3.6 build is ok but i'm unable to replicate a successful install.
Note that I have been running tf-gpu on this machine for a while now so not a dll problem etc. Epecially as a) mrry check script is ok and b) 1.2.1 works just
