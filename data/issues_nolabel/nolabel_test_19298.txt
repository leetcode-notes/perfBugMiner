Describe the problem
We have an issue open in scio (spotify/scio#1137) which depends on java TF artifacts, please read full description in the link above. A TLDR: in cross test TF crushes with:
Cannot register 2 metrics with the same name: /tensorflow/cc/saved_model/load_attempt_count

This problem started to manifest itself from version 1.4.0 (previous versions were not affected), and continues to be a problem. The minimal reproduction repo is here: https://github.com/ravwojdyla/minimal-repo-tf-crushing and to reproduce you run sbt +test.
