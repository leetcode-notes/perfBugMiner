Replace deprecated tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_accuracy with tf.metrics.accuracy

As tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_accuracy (tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_squared_error) has been deprecated and has been replaced with tf.metrics.accuracy, this fix replaces deprecated tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_accuracy with tf.metrics.accuracy in tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/evaluation.py.
