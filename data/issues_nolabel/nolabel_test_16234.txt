The recognized result is not correct when converting the frozen graph to tflite for android device use

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Hi, I covert the frozen graph:mobilenet_v1_224 to tflite, and put it in the tflitecamerademo app, but the regonization result is not correct. If I use the tflite file which download from https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/mobilenet_v1_224_android_quant_2017_11_08.zip
The regonization result is correct, I don't know what steps is not correct when I covert the frozeon graph to tflite file, could you help me to review what steps is the wrong?
I put the frozen graph, coverting tflite file and the regonized picture in the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12h9O2AtcnDuQZXogAdmexRSjxIQVc1Ej?usp=sharing
The correct result should be "malamute", but I use the my coverting tflite file, the result is "shower curtain"
I use the command to do the covert
bazel run --config=opt //tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco:toco -- '--input_file=/tmp/mobilenet_frozen_graph.pb' '--output_file=/tmp/mobilenet_quant_20180117.tflite' '--input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF' '--output_format=TFLITE' '--inference_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8' '--inference_input_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8' '--input_shapes=1,224,224,3' '--input_arrays=input' '--output_arrays=MobilenetV1/Predictions/Reshape_1' '--mean_values=128' '--std_values=128' '--default_ranges_min=0' '--default_ranges_max=6'
Thanks
