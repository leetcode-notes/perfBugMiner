tf.constant_initializer does not accept Tensor as input

I'd like to load multiple copies of VGG on each of 4 different GPUs.. rather than copy the weights down to each GPU every time, I'd like a local copy of the weights. Unfortunately using constant_initializer and a numpy array explodes the graph def (as all the n copies of the weights are stored).
Instead, I convert the weights to a tensor once, and want to use this tensor to initialize the variable. this keeps the graphdef small and allows me to be super flexible. Unfortunately it looks like tf.constant_initializer doesn't accept Tensors as values.
