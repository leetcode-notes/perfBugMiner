Fixed memory leak with py_func (#18292)

This PR fixes the memory leak described in #18292. Tests for py_func are running.
Some internals:

Replaced dict in FuncRegistry._funcs by weakref.WeakValueDictionary (python 2.7, python 3.x).
Replaced the CleanupFunc by a direct reference to the function. Thus renamed _cleanup_py_funcs_used_in_graph to '_py_funcs_used_in_graph`.
Improved tests to cover the leak. Leak detection is now precise (uses gc.collect()).
