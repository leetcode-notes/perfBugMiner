Why still using two gpus even if I have set gpu_device to the second gpu?

NOTE: Only file GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests.  All other topics will be closed.
I want to use the second gpu, and I use the following code to do this:
with tf.Session() as sess:
with tf.device("/gpu:1"):
but why the nvidis-smi results still shows that tensorflow is using both of the two gpus?
