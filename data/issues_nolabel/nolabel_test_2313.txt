Batched gather

This is related to #2170, which describes how to use tf.gather to index on the first dimension of a tensor. What I'd like to do now is batch this operation:
params = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5. 6]])
indices = tf.constant([0, 1, 0])
gathered = tf.batch_gather(params, indices)
# gathered = [1, 4, 5]
