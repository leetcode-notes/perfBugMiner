ImportError:
Importing the multiarray numpy extension module failed.  Most
likely you are trying to import a failed build of numpy.
If you're working with a numpy git repo, try git clean -xdf (removes all
files not under version control).  Otherwise reinstall numpy.

I tried reinstalling numpy too, same error.
