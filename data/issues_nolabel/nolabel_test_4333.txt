dynamic_rnn() cannot receive an input of dynamic shape during training

Hi all, I met some problem when using dynamic_rnn() and wonder if there is any solution.
Firstly I sort all examples according to its length(variable length input). Then I use "batch padding" in my code. So in each step during training, data generator generates a padded minibatch, whose shape differ from the last batch. And I feed the minibatch data to the graph. Since the placeholder "inputs" in graph has an uncertain shape, it raised an error when tensor flows to dynamic_rnn() node. If I specify the placeholder's shape, everything is ok.
Now dynamic_rnn() can only receive inputs with a fixed shape. How can I combine it with "batch padding"?
Thanks!
