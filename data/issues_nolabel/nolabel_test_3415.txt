Speed up retraining times  approximately 2x

Speed up is achieved by:

saving (and especially loading) bottleneck arrays in binary files instead of .txt files
caching already calculated bottleneck arrays in RAM, instead of reading them every time from disk

P.S.
2x speed up is achieved on SSD disks, on HDD disks speed up is even greater
