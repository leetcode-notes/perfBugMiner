Default keras initializers parameters have changed

At least in Tensorflow 1.3, some of the Keras initializers have changed they default parameters since Tensorflow 1.1:
In Tensorflow 1.1:
from tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras.initializers import TruncatedNormal TruncatedNormal().stddev # returns 0.05
In Tensorflow 1.3:
from tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras.initializers import TruncatedNormal TruncatedNormal().stddev # returns 1
I assume this was not intentional since this is a breaking change and I did not see it documented in the release notes.
