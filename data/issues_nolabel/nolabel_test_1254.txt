Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
What have you tried?

I reinstall the old 0.6.0 pip package, everything works
I installed 0.7.1 cpu only version, it still doesn't work
I upgrade cuda & cudnn to 7.5 &v4, it still doesn't work
