Semi sync optimizer

Async SGD is faster than sync SGD but inferior in AUC.
This optimizer wrapper would like to provide a balance between speed and AUC. Each worker mainly works in async mode. But after certain number of batches (usually n_of_batch> worker_count but not necessarily), workers should sync together to mitigate the stale gradient issue.
Based on our test, this is useful for our CTR prediction tasks.
