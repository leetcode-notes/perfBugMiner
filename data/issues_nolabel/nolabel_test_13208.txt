Use Tensors instead of TensorArrays for storing AttentionWrapper's alignment_history

I would like to propose this fix for #13154.
This is a breaking change as it replaces TensorArrays of the alignment_history field with batch major Tensors.
Additionally, the helper function used to gather beams in BeamSearchDecoder had to be updated to allow keeping the original values dimensions.
