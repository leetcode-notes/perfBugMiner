Documentation of  tf.extract_image_patches is incomplete and slightly inaccurate

Hi,
The documentation of tf.extract_image_patches is unclear and slightly incorrect.

The function call requires the first 5 parameters to be set and throws an error otherwise.The documentation, however, mentions that they are optional parameters.
The "out_rows" and "out_cols" are not defined making it hard to make sense of what this function is actually doing.
The definition of "rates" is not clear.. Is patch_size same as k_rows or k_cols?

Running
test_patches = tf.extract_image_patches(images, padding="SAME",ksizes=[1, 32, 32, 1], strides=[1, 32, 32, 1], rates=[1,1, 1, 1])
where images = 1X299x299x3 returns me a tensor (test_patches) of shape 1x10x10x3072.
1.Is test_patches[0,0,0,:] the first patch test_patches[0,0,1,:] the second patch and so on?
2. If (1) is true, how was the dimension of a patch reduced from 32x32x3 to 3072, i.e., how exactly should this be reshaped? I tried reshaping test_patches[0,0,0,:] to (32,32,3) and (3,32,32) but the resulting image patch does not make sense.
Clarifying the documentation of this method would be immensely helpful!

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Just calling this function would do.
