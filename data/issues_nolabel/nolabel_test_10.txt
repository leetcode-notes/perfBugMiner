Go API

Hi!,
I'm really interested on contribute in my spare time on this project, it  would be great for me port the Python libraries to Go, or help with this task, the problem is that after read the "Contributing guidelines" I still don't know how to do it.
I tried to sing the Individual CLA, but I get an error that says: "You must be an owner of the contributors group in order to submit this CLA.".
Btw, are you working, or do you plan to implement soon the Go libs?
Some related projects that I implemented in Go: https://github.com/alonsovidales/pit - This is a distributed recommender system based in the "Adaptive Bootstrapping of Recommender Systems Using Decision Trees" paper by Yahoo. The site of the project: http://pitia.info/
And the Go ML: Some machine learning algorithms in Go: https://github.com/alonsovidales/go_ml I also implemented Neural Networks with CUDA: https://github.com/alonsovidales/go_ml/tree/cuda_implementation
Thanks,
