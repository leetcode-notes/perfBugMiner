Broken link on beginner's tutorial page

At the bottom of http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.md is a link to "the next tutorial": http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/index.md
For some reason, that link redirects to the home page. Removing index.md from the end of the URL works.
