There is an issue with your "new issue" page

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

All systems/system independent

Describe the problem
If there are documentation issues, the "New Issue" button will direct many people to StackOverflow. The notions of "bugs and features" are not universal in that they only apply to software, not to documentation as far as some people are concerned. IMHO the text above would be better if it stated that "1. It must be a bug or a feature request, or a correction/clarification to documentation"
