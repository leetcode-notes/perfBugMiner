Update the Android demo to use retrained models

The Android example currently uses an older Inception model. It requires some changes to load the one used by the label_image, classify_image, and image_retraining examples. These include altering the names of the input and output layers, ensuring the larger model can be loaded, and updating the mean, standard deviation, and image size parameters.
Once this is done, people should be able to transfer retrained models to a device easily. This issue also covers documenting that process.
