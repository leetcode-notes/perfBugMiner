[Feature Request]: Resize netwoks on the fly

Hi,
Do you plan to change the present paradigm about tensorflow neural network that make the networks size to be static after using run ?
Is it plan to be able to resize on the fly the network shape (number of kernels, type of activation function, type of down sampling) during the training for instance.
Thanks.
