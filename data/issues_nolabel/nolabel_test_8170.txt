tensorflow 2st test:"CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY", What's wrong here???

when I run:



import tensorflow as tf
hello=tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess=tf.Session()
ERROR came like that:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:910] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero
