Tensorflow installer

Hi TensorFlow Team,
I would like to propose a simple bash script to automate the installation of required tools(based on os_setup.md instructions), I think it will help many newbies. It is available under :  https://github.com/bellaj/tensorflow/blob/master/setup_Tensor.sh
This script will help users to install Tensorflow for many Linux distributions .
I have tested it for ubuntu 64, and it works fine.
I am working now on GPU support
any feedback is welcome
thank you
