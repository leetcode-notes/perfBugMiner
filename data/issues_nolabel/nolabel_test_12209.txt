Make LayerNormBasicLSTMCell compatible with datatypes other than float32

LayerNormBasicLSTMCell only supported float32 so far. With this patch other datatypes such as float64 are available too. The datatype doesn't have to be specified explicitly but it is deducted from the input data as it already happens for example for BasicLSTMCell.
