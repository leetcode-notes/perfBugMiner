MNIST example using TFRecordWriter context manager.

The TFRecordWriter wasn't being explicitly closed. Updated the example to use the context while writing the examples.
NOTE: This code will throw an error on any install of TensorFlow before this commit. The exception will likely be AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'.
Would it be better to call TFRecordWriter#close() explicitly on this example code since that would work with older version of TF as well?
