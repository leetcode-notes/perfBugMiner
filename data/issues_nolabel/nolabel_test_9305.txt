Add reqeueue operations.

This PR adds requeue and requeue_many operations to QueueBase. The operations dequeue an element/elements from the queue, add the element(s) to the queue again, and return an op that evaluates to the dequeued value.
The motivation behind these operations is to be able to reuse training data that is hard to come by after using them in training.
