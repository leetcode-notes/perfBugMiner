Add execute permission to import_pb_to_tensorboard.py

I used chmod +x to add the execute permission.
TESTING
Before this change, you get a Permission denied error when trying to run import_pb_to_tensorboard.py:
$ ./tensorflow/python/tools/import_pb_to_tensorboard.py
-bash: ./tensorflow/python/tools/import_pb_to_tensorboard.py: Permission denied

After the change, the script runs without needing to use chmod.
Tested on Mac OSX Sierra 10.12.6.
