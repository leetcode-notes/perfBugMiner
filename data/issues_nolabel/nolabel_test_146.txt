Wrong multiplication in MNIST beginner tutorial

(Not sure if this is the right place to report a problem with this tutorial.)
I believe that the explanation of matrix multiplication in this image is wrong.
It should be W_1,1 x_1 + W_1,2 x_2 + W_1,3 x_3... (i.e., x should increase per row, not per column).
