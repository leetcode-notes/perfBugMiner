tensorflow-gpu not working with pycharm

I am trying to get the tensorflow-gpu working on pycharm but it doesn't compile. When I compile it, it gives me the following compile error

ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_80.dll'. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Download and install CUDA 8.0 from this URL:

I am using Pycharm with the Python 3.6 venv and I am pretty sure I have CUDA 8.0 installed. When I check the directory of CUDA\v8.0\bin, it shows the cudart64_80.dll
It works perfectly on the CPU version but I want it working on the GPU side
