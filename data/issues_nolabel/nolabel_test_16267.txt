Fix compilation error and warnings with CUDA=0

There is a compilation error when compiling verbs with CUDA=0. This is rarely used, but we still want it to compile of course.
Also there are some compilation warnings that shouldn't exist. Mostly about 'unused functions' when setting/unsetting certain preprocessor defines.
