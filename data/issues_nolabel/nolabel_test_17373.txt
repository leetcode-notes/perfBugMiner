Illegal instruction on import tensorflow

I had installed a non-optimized version of tensorflow (1.6.0) on debian (Debian GNU/Linux 8) for use within python 3.6.4.
I was told that SSE4.1 and SSE4.2 instructions were supported by my CPU but that the tensorflow I was using was not compiled to support it, so I decided to use one of the pre-compiled whl's.
This resulted in a "illegal instruction" error which exits python immediately.
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the original version but the error message keeps coming back...
I cleared the pip cache as well, yet still nothing seems to help.
Any idea on how to resolve this?
It almost appears like uninstalling doesn't remove everything?
(I know some may suggest that I work with docker, yet that still leaves me with a broken environment...)
