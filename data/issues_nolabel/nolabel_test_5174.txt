Einsum dynamic shape bug fix

I fixed a bug in einsum that did not allow for dynamic tensor shapes. I'm not sure if that's the only change necessary and I'm also not sure what conventions you follow to write tests for this, so since I have a paper deadline approaching I'll leave it at that for now. It seems to be working fine for me but I haven't tested any edge cases.
