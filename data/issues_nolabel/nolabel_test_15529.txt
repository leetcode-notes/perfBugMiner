Sample Distorted Bounding Box Bug

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Stock Example
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
16.04.3 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.4.0
Python version:
Python 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:
cuda_9.0.176_384.81 / cudnn 7
GPU model and memory:
GTX 755M 2gb Memory x2
Exact command to reproduce:
begin, size, bbox_for_draw = tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box(
tf.shape(image),
bounding_boxes=bounding_boxes)

Describe the problem
When using the tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box() function the parameter min_object_covered seems to default to value None which causes an error (ValueError: None values not supported.)  If you give an argument for min_object_covered it seems to work fine.
There seems to be two versions of this function in the source v2 which takes min_object_covered as a argument and a v1 which has the default value of 0.1 as an attribute.  It appears v2 is the one being used.  Not sure what approach is best to take for fixing this bug but believe the root of the issue is coming from tensorflow/core/ops/image_ops.cc
