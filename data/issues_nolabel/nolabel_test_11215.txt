Add 'wget' to be installed in docker image

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Using scripts provided with tensorflow to download and build imagenet from scratch.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-5-g435cdfc', '1.2.1')
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GRID M6-8Q(8GB)
Exact command to reproduce: bazel-bin/inception/download_and_preprocess_imagenet "${DATA_DIR}"

Describe the problem
I am trying to train inception v3 net for imagenet dataset using instructions at-


After setting the download path using following command -
# location of where to place the ImageNet data
DATA_DIR=$HOME/imagenet-data

I ran the bazel command to build preprocessing script-
# build the preprocessing script.
cd tensorflow-models/inception
bazel build //inception:download_and_preprocess_imagenet

And then run it-
# run it
bazel-bin/inception/download_and_preprocess_imagenet "${DATA_DIR}"

Running above command fails saying it cannot find wget -

root@docker_container:/data/workspace/models/inception# bazel-bin/inception/download_and_preprocess_imagenet "${DATA_DIR}"
In order to download the imagenet data, you have to create an account with
image-net.org. This will get you a username and an access key. You can set the
IMAGENET_USERNAME and IMAGENET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables, or you can
enter the credentials here.

Access key:

I have reported this as bug #11214 as well
