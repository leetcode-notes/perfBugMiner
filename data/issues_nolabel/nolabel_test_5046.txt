Multi-core not being utilized?

I have a 8 vCPUs 30GB Debian instance on the Google Cloud Platform, running the TensorFlow implementation of the WaveNet from https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet
I noticed that CPU usage stays around 13%, as if only one of the 8 vCPUs is being used. I have found this issue #583 which seems to indicate that such problem should have been fixed.
Any advice on what I need to do in order for all of the vCPUs on my instance to be full utilized in such a case? Thanks!
