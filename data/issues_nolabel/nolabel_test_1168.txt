Program using GPU and CPU mix got slower in  Tensorflow 0.7

I have a Titan X,
On 0.6, code running well and fast 5 sec for 10 epoch.
I upgrade to 0.7, code running so slow 85 sec for 10 epoch and no matter python2.7 or python3.4.
GPU always on and detected so no CPU is used (unless it has to : "allow_soft_placement=True").
With nvidia-smi, i checked that the GPU was 40 % used in 0.6 version. And it is 97% used in 0.7 version.
So, the GPU is more used for a worst training time ?
