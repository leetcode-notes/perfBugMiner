Issue with Colab Pytnotebook and Tensorflow hub

I was trying the Colab example with Tensorflow hub here
# Install the latest Tensorflow version.
!pip install --quiet --upgrade --pre tensorflow
# Install TF-Hub.
!pip install tensorflow-hub
!pip install tf-nightly

to have the nightly build, but when I try to install
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd
import re
import seaborn as sns
I get this version error
