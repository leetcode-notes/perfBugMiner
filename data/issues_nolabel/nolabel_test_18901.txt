Describe the problem
Attempting to build the sample with make will fail in the linking stage with an undefined reference tonsync::nsync_cv_signal(nsync::nsync_cv_s_*)'. Adding-Ltensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/nsync/builds/default.linux.c++11toLDFLAGS(taken from the env var TARGET_NSYNC_LIB) and-l:nsync.atoLIBS` fixes the problem.
So far I hardcoded the paths, so I can't really make a PR (and I'm not experienced enough with shell scripts / makefiles to propose a decent fix).
