Java:  The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX / SSE / FMA instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations

I'm building a small project using the current java binding of TensorFlow - tensorflow-java 
When running the examples of inception network I get this warning about the platform cpu instruction set that could be used

Is it possibile to build the jar here enabling SSE, AVX and FMA instruction set?
