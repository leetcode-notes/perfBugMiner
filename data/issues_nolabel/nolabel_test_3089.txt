What have you tried?

Have tried looking at #1817 which had same error. It is not intermittent as described in that issue, it fails every single time but works if you just try to clone the repo directly.
However, running git clone https://github.com/google/boringssl.git results in:

git clone https://github.com/google/boringssl.git
