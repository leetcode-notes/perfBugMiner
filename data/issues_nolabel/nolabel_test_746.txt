Fix broken reference to TensorBase::Serialize

I spent a few hours trying to track down this reference. Hopefully future readers won't have to!
In case anyone's curious, TensorBase is part of Eigen. I believe the contents of the tensor_content field are just packed arrays of raw floats, doubles, or whatever the value type is.
