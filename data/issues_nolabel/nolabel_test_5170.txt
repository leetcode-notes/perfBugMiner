files not found "graph.pb.h" and "image_ops.h"

The 2 files below are included in main.cc of label image example, but i can't find these 2 .h files in the relevant ops and framework folders. So we can remove them out directly?
include "tensorflow/cc/ops/image_ops.h"
include "tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h"
