TFRecordWriter.flush() for Python bundle?

TFRecords.Writer seems to take up too much memory when dealing with large dateset and may cause out-of-memory issue.
Also, the .TFRecords file seems not appendable right now, so it's pretty hard to write large dataset to a single .TFRecords file at one run.
Flush() is available on the C++ side in tensorflow::core::lib::io::RecordWriter but is not exposed in the Python bindings. Is it possible to add a python interface to make it easier?
