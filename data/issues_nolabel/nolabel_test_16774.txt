Describe the problem
The TensorBoard-callback in Keras supports the writing of embeddings to the log, but this is not supported in the TensorFlow version of Keras, even though the doc-string of the TensorFlow version actually lists these parameters.

                 embeddings_freq: frequency (in epochs) at which selected embedding 
        

        
          
                     layers will be saved. 
        

        
          
                 embeddings_layer_names: a list of names of layers to keep eye on. If 
        

        
          
                     None or empty list all the embedding layer will be watched. 
        

        
          
                 embeddings_metadata: a dictionary which maps layer name to a file name 
        

        
          
                     in which metadata for this embedding layer is saved. See the 
        

        
          
                     [details](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/embedding_viz/#metadata_optional) 
        

        
          
                     about metadata files format. In case if the same metadata file is 
        

        
          
                     used for all embedding layers, string can be passed. 
        
    
  


But these are missing from the __init__:

        Lines 656 to 662
      in
      579125e
    
    
    
    

        
          
           def __init__(self, 
        

        
          
                        log_dir='./logs', 
        

        
          
                        histogram_freq=0, 
        

        
          
                        batch_size=32, 
        

        
          
                        write_graph=True, 
        

        
          
                        write_grads=False, 
        

        
          
                        write_images=False): 
        
    
  


This is the original Keras implementation which has e.g. embeddings_freq:
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/ad00676b80556a6354180a1bfa3009d4db316d3e/keras/callbacks.py#L642-L650
There seems to be a difference between the original Keras implementation and the version in TensorFlow. I am wondering if these are somehow developed in parallel so it is actually not the original Keras that is included with TensorFlow?
Thanks!
