Read tflite file failed on iOS

Hi
I tried the examples on iOS according to TF Lite guide, but failed when assign data to tflite because address "out" is NULL. probably my tflite file is incorrect, but I am not sure, can anybody give some help?
My test step is as follows:

Try the following code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite),  get the tflite file converteds_model.tflite

import tensorflow as tf
img = tf.placeholder(name="img", dtype=tf.float32, shape=(1, 64, 64, 3))
val = img + tf.constant([1., 2., 3.]) + tf.constant([1., 4., 4.])
out = tf.identity(val, name="out")
with tf.Session() as sess:
  tflite_model = tf.contrib.lite.toco_convert(sess.graph_def, [img], [out])
  open("converteds_model.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)


Integrated the tflite into my app, which is from iOS sample code "simple"(/Users/Sensteer/Software/tensorflowclone/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/lite/examples/ios/simple).But exception happed because address "out" is NULL

int input = interpreter->inputs()[0];                                 //input is 3
float* out = interpreter->typed_tensor<float>(input);          //out is NULL

So my questions are:

The tflite created above is right or not?
The reading tflite code is right or not?
If the tflite file is not right, do I must create tflite with  "pb", "ckpt" and "FrozenGraphDef" mentioned in guide?

Thanks
