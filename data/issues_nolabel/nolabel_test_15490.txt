Cannot reshape with shape=[tensorshapes...]

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I have several Conv layers and after the last max pooling step, I want to flatten the last pooled layer shape=(Batchsize, height, width, channels) to (Batchsize, -1). It returned error saying some dims are None.
I tried to print the BS and other_dims, it can be printed to int numbers, none of them are None
If I entered explicit int numbers tf.reshape(x, [2,10]) it will work.
top MLP
    shape = tf.shape(pooled_h[-1])
    BS = shape[0]
    other_dims = shape[1] * shape[2] * shape[3]
    last_pooled_flat = tf.reshape(pooled_h[-1], [BS, other_dims])  # (BS, n_flat_feats)
    mlp_h = [last_pooled_flat]  # to store mlp hidden layers

MLP alyers
    for j in range(self.n_mlp_layers):
        h = tf.layers.dense(
            inputs=mlp_h[j],
            units=self.hidden_sizes[i],
            activation=tf.nn.relu,
            kernel_initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(
                        uniform=True, seed=None, dtype=tf.float32),
            bias_initializer=tf.zeros_initializer(),
            kernel_regularizer=L2_regularizer,
            bias_regularizer=L2_regularizer,
            name="mlp_{}".format(j),
            reuse=False)
        mlp_h.append(h)

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
