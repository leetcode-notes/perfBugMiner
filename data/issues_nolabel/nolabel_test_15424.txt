"Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization" at org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface.loadGraph.loadGraph

Hi,
I build libtensorflow_inference.so & libandroid_tensorflow_inference_java.jar from source, then use them in an android studio project. But when I run
TensorFlowInferenceInterface tflite = new TensorFlowInferenceInterface(assetManager, MODEL_PATH);
the program always crashes and prints
"
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization: Invalid GraphDef
at org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface.loadGraph(TensorFlowInferenceInterface.java:551)
at org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface.(TensorFlowInferenceInterface.java:105)
......
"
The tflite file in MODEL_PATH is generated successfully by bazel toco from a model graph, and the tflite file is successfully read into byte array. Are there any special restrictions on the graph? What are the possible reasons why function TensorFlowInferenceInterface.loadGraph() throws an Exception?
Thanks a lot.
