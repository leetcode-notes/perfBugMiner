[feature request] disable harmful broadcast

Broadcast may lead to hidden bugs. For example, the following code,
xent = tf.nn. sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, y)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(xent)

When logits is of the shape (200,1) and the y is of the shape (200,), the xent becomes (200, 200), which is wrong. What's worse, the reduce_mean will hide this problem by reducing everything into a scalar.
Request,

more shape validation in sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits
option to totally disable broadcast
