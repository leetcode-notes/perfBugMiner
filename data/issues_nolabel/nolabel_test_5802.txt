A theano.clone() equivalent for Tensorflow

This an implementation of a clone() function for Tensorflow based on meta_graph utilities, inspired by discussion with @sherrym in #5477 .
Feature requests on this can be found in #1070  #5479 . Previous implementations of copying graphs #557 does copy naively and doesn't have replace feature as in theano.clone().
Though this implementation is almost good. It still has problems for now with control flow copies. To be specific, I'm not sure how to deal with collections of cond_context and while_context, because both of its to_proto functions only consider the case of stripping export_scope.
Not copying cond_context collection to new operations (to their _control_flow_context) will cause problems described in #5477 , also demonstrated in the last test (testCloneBatchNorm) in this pull request, which is failed for now. I'm opening this PR early before that test pass, wondering if someone can have advice on dealing with control flow collections when cloning subgraphs. Thanks.
