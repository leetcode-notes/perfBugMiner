[Test]Fix the array type bug

Fix the PS_ARRAY and WORKER_ARRAY  bug. They should be arrays, but in fact they are strings. The problem is the wrong way for assigning bash array.
The log info before fixing:
2 worker process(es) running in parallel...
Worker 0: 
  WORKER HOST: localhost:2223 localhost:2224 
  log file: /tmp/worker0.log
Worker 1: 
  WORKER HOST: 
  log file: /tmp/worker1.log

After:
2 worker process(es) running in parallel...
Worker 0: 
  WORKER HOST: localhost:2223
  log file: /tmp/worker0.log
Worker 1: 
  WORKER HOST: localhost:2224
  log file: /tmp/worker1.log
