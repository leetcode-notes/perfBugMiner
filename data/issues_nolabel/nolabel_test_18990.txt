Is the expected_shape argument of tf.Variable still useable/useful?

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Installed with Anaconda
TensorFlow version (use command below):
b'v1.8.0-0-g93bc2e2072' 1.8.0
Python version:
3.6.5

I know this might be a small docs fix which doesn't fit the issue policy. But I'm not sure and I don't really know how to fix it. I'm sorry. But it seems that the expected_shape argument of tf.Variable has been deprecated for a long time (since v1.0.0). Is it still useable/useful? Is there a reason it is still in the documentation?
