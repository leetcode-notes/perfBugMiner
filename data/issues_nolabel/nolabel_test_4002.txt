Ignoring gpu device with Cuda compute capability 3.0. The minimum required Cuda capability is 3.5.

I build TF with:
TF_UNOFFICIAL_SETTING=1
TF_CUDA_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES=3.0

which used to work but within the last few days I now get:
Ignoring gpu device (device: 0, name: GRID K520, pci bus id: 0000:00:03.0) with Cuda compute capability 3.0. The minimum required Cuda capability is 3.5.

I wonder if this got broken with: 353235e
