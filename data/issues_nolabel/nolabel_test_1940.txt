convolution on dimension variable inputs

I would like to perform a convolution on dimension variable inputs.
The only solution I find and I think that it would work is to perform a convolution on each input and perform a scan on batch_size. I think this is not optimal.
Is there another function or method to do this differently in TensorFlow?
Thanks in advance.
