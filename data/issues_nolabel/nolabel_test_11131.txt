how use tensorflow model in optimization model

hi
i know how to save, restore and feed a tensorflow model but how can i use tf model in optimization model (like the genetic algorithm, python deep package). my problem is in transforming (convert) tf value to python. if I want to use
python_variable=sess.run(tf_variable)
or
python_variable=tf_variable.eval()
for each population (genetic run) I should initialize sess and .... this process is very time-consuming. what is the solution?
is there any better solution or tensorflow have any optimization algorithm?
