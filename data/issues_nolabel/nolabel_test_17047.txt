Failing assertion when building with MKL and using Xception

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
v1.6.0-rc0-19-gecec1d8
Python version:
Python 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Bazel 0.8.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5)
CUDA/cuDNN version:
None
GPU model and memory:
None
Exact command to reproduce:


Get the Dockerfile from here: https://gist.github.com/abiro/c155a8107879d9c4e0368f3c3e94ea81
Build with the MKL library: docker build -t tf_mkl -f Dockerfile.devel-cpu-mkl .
Build without the MKL library: docker build -t tf_nomkl -f Dockerfile.devel-cpu-mkl --build-arg MKL_FLAG=0 .
Run image built with the MKL library: docker run tf_mkl
Result: error (see output below)
Run image built without the MKL library: docker run tf_nomkl
Result: no error

Describe the problem
When building TensorFlow 1.6 with the MKL library, inference with the Xception model results in a failing assertion and the program exits. See the error message and the code below please. The Dockerfile linked above contains the source code and can be used to easily reproduce the problem.
Source code / logs
Source code
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = tf.keras.applications.xception.Xception(weights="xception_weights.h5")
x.predict(np.zeros((1, 299, 299, 3)), batch_size=1)
Logs
Step 4 from above outputs the following:

2018-02-15 15:04:26.610461: F tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl_input_conversion_op.cc:448] Check failed: tf_input.CheckReorderToOpMem( memory::primitive_desc(output_mkl_md, cpu_engine), tensor_out, &net) == true (0 vs. 1)
Aborted (core dumped)

Misc
The host machine used to build and run the Docker containers was an EC2 c4.2xlarge instance with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2666 v3 @ 2.90GHz processor.
