AttributeError during pip install when building from source

I was trying to build TensorFlow from source, and all went well until I was in the last step
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow-pkg/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-py2-none-any.whl
it crashes with this error message:

Exception:

I did some search online and found that this may be due to an upstream bug and it's been happening in other projects too. Is there anyway to work around this issue? I currently can't use a pre-compiled whl because I'm using gtx1080 and CUDA8, i think the precompiled whl only supports 7.5
I'm using Ubuntu 16.04, python 2.7, pip 8.1.1
