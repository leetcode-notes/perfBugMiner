MKL-DNN:  fix batchnorm unit test failures

Fix failures of all 9 fuse batchnorm test cases.
handle corner case (empty input tensors)
handle inference case properly - bwd bug related to fwd primitive creation (as a hint)
refactor - moving output tensor allocation to separate methods - to avoid duplicated code
