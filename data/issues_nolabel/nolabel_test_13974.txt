Update device string comments in node_def.proto

Clarifying comments for valid device string in NodeDef, as discussed in PR #13874.
Notes:

The device string is as returned by device.py to_string()
parse_from_string() in device.py seems currently allows an empty string for device_type (line 167). This commit reflects that.  Is this actually intended behavior?
I notice our regex convention does not use '+' (e.g. XX* instead of X+).
