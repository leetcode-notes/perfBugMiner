Added info about how to run TensorBoard for the Deep CNN example.

The CIFAR tutorial talks a bit about the TensorBoard and I think it'd be nice if the command to run it was mentioned explicitly in the tutorial. Otherwise you have to look the documentation for the TensorBoard and open cifar10_train.py to see where the log files are being saved.
