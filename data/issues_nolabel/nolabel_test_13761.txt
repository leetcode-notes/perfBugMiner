tf.reduce_sum gives value error when given int64 as input.

Passing a tensor of dtype=int64 into tf.reduce sum I receive the following error:
Tensor("loss/diff:0", shape=(50,), dtype=int64)
ValueError: Invalid type tf.int64 for loss/Sum:0, expected: [tf.float32, tf.float64, tf.float16].
According to the documents from https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reduce_sum:
input_tensor: The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.
As int64 is a numeric type I am not sure what's wrong.
To create the diff tensor I do:
        self.predictions = tf.argmax(self.logits, 1, name='predictions')

         # Loss
        with tf.name_scope("loss"):
            self.diff = tf.subtract(self.predictions, self.targets)
            self.diff = tf.multiply(self.diff,self.diff, name='diff')
            print self.diff
            self.diff = tf.reduce_sum(self.diff)

Where predictions is of type int64 and my targets placeholder is also of type int64.
Is this a tensorflow error or an error on my end?
