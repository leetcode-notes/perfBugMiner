Extend #3020 to decode animated GIF

#3020 has been squashed into a single commit, with proper authorship acknowledgment. I'll squash my commits after code review.
This PR extends #3020 by loading all frames. The underlying library  giflib is too low level to handle the GIF optimizations properly, so an error will be raised if the source GIF is optimized.
For the test, a synthetic file is used to test the actual decoded content.
