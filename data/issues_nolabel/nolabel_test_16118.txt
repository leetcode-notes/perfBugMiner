Minor improvements to TFRecord format docs

The TFRecord format documentation mentions that hashes are computed using a CRC32, but doesn't mention the polynomial used. I added that detail, so the documentation is now sufficient for a developer trying to write a parser / writer for (uncompressed) TFRecord files.
