Problem running Convolutional.py

I am trying to run the convolutional.py through the tensorflow virtualenv i am getting an error as follows
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "convolutional.py", line 290, in 
tf.app.run()
File "/home/akshay/tensorflow/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/default/_app.py", line 30, in run
sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
File "convolutional.py", line 121, in main
train_data_filename = maybe_download('train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz')
File "convolutional.py", line 56, in maybe_download
os.mkdir(WORK_DIRECTORY)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'data'
I am getting this error even when i am running as super user.
