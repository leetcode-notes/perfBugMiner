The documentation of the above function is available on the official Tensorflow page.

Can somebody explain me the meaning of the argument 'rates' and also what do these lines mean, preferably with an example with value of 'rates' >1 ?
This is the input stride, specifying how far two consecutive patch samples are in the input. Equivalent to extracting patches with patch_sizes_eff = patch_sizes + (patch_sizes - 1) * (rates - 1), followed by subsampling them spatially by a factor of rates. This is equivalent to rate in dilated (a.k.a. Atrous) convolutions.
