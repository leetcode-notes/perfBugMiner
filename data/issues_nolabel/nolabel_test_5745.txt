Constants are placed on a device when they do nothing but feed off-device nodes

I have created a device that supports integer constant tensors (because I would like to be able to support the inputs to reshape etc...), but not the integer maths operators (because I'm not going to accelerate those initially).
The gradient generation logic creates trees of integer maths.  The constants for this maths are placed on the device, while the maths nodes themselves are placed on the CPU (as expected).
This isn't very sensible.
I think it would be better that constants are not placed on a device, unless they are feeding downstream nodes that are also on the same device.
There may be some classes of constant (ones with a specific memory placement, very large ones), which would end up on a different device to their downstream nodes, but I think that the default should be to keep them together.
