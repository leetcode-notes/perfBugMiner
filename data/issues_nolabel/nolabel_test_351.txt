Failed to load compute graph when executing label_image example

after cloning tensorflow on my OSX 10.10.4, I tried to run label_image example in tensorflow/examples/, and followed the instructions.
currently seems fine after built even some warnings were occured but no error.
but when I typed 'bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image'
it showed:
E tensorflow/examples/label_image/main.cc:260] Not found: Failed to load compute graph at 'tensorflow/examples/label_image/data/googlenet_graph.pb'
I saw a file named tensorflow_inception_graph.pb in that folder, and I tried to rename it to googlenet_graph.pb and executed again, and it showed:
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:40] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 4
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc:60] Direct session inter op parallelism threads: 4
Segmentation fault: 11
then I don't know what I am supposed to try, please show me a way to solve it, thanks.
