Change file system FileExists interface to return Status

The pull request addresses issue #5321.

FileExists(name, &result).ok() && result
Tests:
Tests run except windows implementation. HDFS is tested with 2.7.3 pseudo-distributed mode.
PS: The folowwing tests may fail when all tests run together, but pass when run standalone, should not related to this change
