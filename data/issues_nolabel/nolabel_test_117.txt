TensorBoard logdir path, if relative, is relative to $HOME

It took me a while to figure this out and I'm not entirely sure that my interpretation is correct, but even if I'm not in $HOME, running tensorboard --logdir=. will give a list of directories in my home, and passing an absolute path appears to pick things up correctly. It is somewhat counterintuitive to me that relative paths are not relative to the current directory, so maybe that's something to document, disallow, or change?
Thanks, this library is amazing!
