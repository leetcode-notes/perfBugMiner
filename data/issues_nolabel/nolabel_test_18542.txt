Why single-image inference on Android using tflite shows different answer everytime?

Hello, I have already asked a question on stackoverflow.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49833090/tflite-accuracy-on-a-device-is-not-consistent-with-that-of-origin-pb-file-on-pc
I am not sure about the mechanism of tensorflow lite, but I am now pretty sure that tflite run only a random part of the model to generate a result. I have thought of the toco operation being the cause and I used it to convert tflite back to pb which works fine same as the origin pb. So I have no idea what's going wrong here. Any advice? thanks a lot.
