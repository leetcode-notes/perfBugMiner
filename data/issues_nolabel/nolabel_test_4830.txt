tensorboard produces a lot of IOError

Hi, I'm using the tensorboard comes with 0.11rc.0 and it outputs a lot of warning on IOError for not being able to find file or directory, e.g. /path/to/tensorflow/tensorboard/paper-item/all-imports.html. I checked the directory and there are indeed no such files. The board still runs but wonder if we can get rid of the warnings. My python env is anaconda 2.7.
