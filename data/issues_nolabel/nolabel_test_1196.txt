tensorflow using cpu+2 gpus turns out 3 times slower than theano using 1 gpu

Does tensorflow automatically use all cpus and gpus to run the computational task?

2.I found that tensorflow use 1 5960X cpu and 2 Titan X gpus cost 300% time compared to theano use only 1 Titan X gpu, is there anything wrong with my configuration? I use the same model generated by keras, using different backend(theano and tensorflow)
I installed on Ubuntu 15.10, cuda 7.5, cudnn 4, gcc 4.9, installed from source code, built with GPU support.
