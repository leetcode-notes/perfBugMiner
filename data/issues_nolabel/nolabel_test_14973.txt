Tensor as index to other tensor not supported?

I have 2 tensors (one is constant and one is placeholder), lets say:
A = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7]
B = [[1,2,4],[5,0],[3]]
I want to build a tensor C like this:
C= [[0.2,0.3,0.5],[0.6,0.1],[0.4]] which is a tensor in the same size of B and every element in C is equal to element in A indexed by B elements.
is there any way to do that?
Thanks!
