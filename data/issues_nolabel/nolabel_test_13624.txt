speech demo is not working on duration different from 1000ms

hi
when i try to use a different data-set (different duration) on the speech recognition demo. the training works well.but the freeze part crash with the message
"Assign requires shapes of both tensors to match "
tried almost everything:

delete the temp directory
pass the same param from train to freeze
make sure that all wav file are with the same size
used the nightly docker
used the latest python

nothing worked!!!!!
my guess is that the problem is in the loading part
any idea what next?
