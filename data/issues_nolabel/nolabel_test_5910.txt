Transposed Atrous Convolutions

Hi there,
I'm looking for atrous (dilated) transposed convolutions, but did not find much.
There is a brief section in the tf.nn.atrous_conv2d doc

Used in conjunction with bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to conv2d_transpose in dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow computation, or depth estimation.

But it is not quite clear how to proceed from there, it looks like tensorflow does not implement the transposed atrous convolution, yet?
