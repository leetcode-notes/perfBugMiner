After I used SyncReplicasOptimizer, tf hang at sess.run

After I used SyncReplicasOptimizer and chief queue runner in distribute tensorflow, it hangs at sess.run.
But after I added below:
queue_runners = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS)
sv.start_queue_runners(sess, queue_runners)
this queue runs OK.
Anyone can tell me why?
I added this code before:
if is_chief:
sv.start_queue_runners(sess, chief_queue_runner)
sess.run(init_token_op)
