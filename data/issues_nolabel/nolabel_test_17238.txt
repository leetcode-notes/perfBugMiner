Cannot install Tensorflow with Visual Studio 2017

Please, add to the documentation a detailed guide on how to install Tensorflow with Visual Studio 2017, on Windows 7 64bit.
I followed many tutorials on Internet, and none works. They frequently have contradictory information.
Is necessary to have an updated, official tutorial.
And please, don't redirect people to stackoverflow. They mistreat anybody trying to start learning, and don't provide any help at all. The people in stackoverflow demands to be an expert just to make a question.
