[Java] Ability to load from SavedModel

This PR is exactly the same as #7688 with updates to the BUILD file to make tests pass so that we can merge the changes in.
Closes #7134 and #7688
@EronWright : Not sure if you saw updates to #7688 asking for tweaks to the PR to make the tests pass. If you want to update that PR instead, I'm happy to abandon this one. Otherwise, will merge this one in and abandon the other.
