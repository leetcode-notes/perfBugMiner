Add support for decoding RGBA images in tfexample_decoder.

Tensorflow's image decoding API's support RGBA images with png/raw formats, but the tfexample_decoder module cannot handle them due to an exception that is thrown when the decode_jpg() case is evaluated with channels >3. This PR works around that limitation by eliminating JPEG as a decoding option when the number channels is >3.
