per_image_standardization is not recognized

Hi,
I installed Tensorflow with Python3 using the pip3 installation instructions from Tensorflow official site.
The version I installed is 0.11.0rc2 and I tried to use per_image_standardization tensor for normalization purposes. However it turned out that is not recognized, giving the following error:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.ops.image_ops' has no attribute 'per_image_standardization'

Has this error ever observed by someone else?
