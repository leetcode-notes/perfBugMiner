fix example typo (too many brackets)

The example was like json.dumps({{}}), which fails because {{}} is not a valid data structure.
Also, just below this, there is assert config.master == 'host4:2222', which I believe would fail since that value comes back as 'grpc://host4:2222', but I'm less sure about recommending this change.
