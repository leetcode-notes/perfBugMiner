Updated Session.run() documentation

For session.run(ops), order in which ops are evaluated is undefined, but that information isn't specified anywhere in documentation. It's quite natural to assume that ops are evaluated in order provided, especially since that's what cpu version of Tensorflow does (at least on every implementation I tried). GPU versions don't always follow FIFO evaluation order though. If needed I can provide a test that shows different behavior with tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu purely due to different order of evaluation inside session.run(ops).
In this pull request I added a single sentence to documentation to make it clear that order of ops evaluation inside session.run(...) is undefined.
