Android error: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs

hi! there is a mistake when i try to use my model on Android to classify pictures.
tensorflow_jni.cc:304 Error during inference: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs
[[Node: DecodeJpeg = DecodeJpegacceptable_fraction=1, channels=3, fancy_upscaling=true, ratio=1, try_recover_truncated=false]]
Environment info
my tensorflow version is 0.10 and i train pictures by tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retain.py on ubuntu 16.04 with GPU
how can i solve it? thanks!
