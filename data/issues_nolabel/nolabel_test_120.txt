TensorFlow session.run() overhead for graphs with few flops

The following code will take 10 seconds to run:
with tf.Session():
    for _ in range(1000):
        tf.constant(0).eval()
Now, this might not be an issue for large-scale machine learning, but it makes running the graph in real-time very hard. I was trying to port a forward simulation model from Theano to TensorFlow, where 1000 runs of forward simulation took 0.2s in Theano vs. 17s in TensorFlow, and over half of the time was taken by this session.run() overhead.
