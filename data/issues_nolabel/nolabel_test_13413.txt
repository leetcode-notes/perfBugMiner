V1.3.1 undefined reference to `clock_gettime' Error

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
ReaHat 6.5 with self compiled gcc 4.8.2 installed locally
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Compile from source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
2.7.14 compiled from source
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
5.4.0 Compiled from source
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I working on Redhat 6.5, with gcc 4.8.2 compiled from source and installed locally, binutiles like ld, as were not updated, glic was 2.12.
I managed to compile tensorflow 1.3.1 shared C++ libs libtensorflow_cc.so, but when Iinking to my projects, it encounted with "undefined reference to `clock_gettime' error. This error can also be reproduced by compiling label image examples with command
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image

Here are the error details:
/home/xxxxxxx/opensource/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/label_image/BUILD:10:1: Linking of rule '//tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image' failed (Exit 1).

I compiled python lib on the exactly the same environment. I had this error when running " import tensorflow". The error was fixed by modifying  "return []" to 'return ["-lrt"] ' in tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl line 975.
I tried the same trick for label_image example, but it didn't work out.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
