Support for histogram_summary in either rnn() or dynamic_rnn()

Hello,
I am trying to add tf.historgram_summary() in my LSTM cells in order to visualize  the output. But currently
neither rnn() or dynamic_rnn() supports writing out summaries.
For rnn(), The log indicates the summary tensor are invalid, which seems to due to the dynamic unrolling of the rnn loop.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_dynamic_rnn.py", line 55, in <module>
    summarys = sess.run(thing, feed_dict=feeds)

tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: The tensor returned for dynamic_scope/RNN/cond_2/BasicLSTMCell/HistogramSummary_1:0 was not valid.

I am currently constructing rnn() like this
  outputs, state = tf.nn.rnn(
      cell, inputs, dtype=tf.float32, sequence_length=sequence_length)
For dynamic_rnn(), it just hangs when I am trying to obtain summaries with the session.run()
And this is how I am constructing dynamic_rnn()
  outputs, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
      cell, inputs=concat_inputs,
      time_major=True, dtype=tf.float32)
Wondering if there is plan to support histogram summary with either of these two RNNs. Thanks.
