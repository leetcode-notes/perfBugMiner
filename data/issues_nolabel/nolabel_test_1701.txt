Building from source with CUDA PATH problem

Environment info
Operating System: Fedora 23
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
8e035ea
Steps to reproduce

../bazel/output/bazel --output_base=/projects/.cache build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures

What have you tried?

./configure on root directory
cuda_config.sh script
building without --config=cuda is successful.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
Output from build

I noticed that PATH in the log doesn't have the directory to libcudart.so.7.5, which is here:
/usr/local/cuda/lib64/
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/lib/nvidia:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/lib/nvidia:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/lib/nvidia
Pointers will be welcome.
