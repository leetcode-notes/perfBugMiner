Add QOL improvements for tf.one_hot()

This commit adds a Python wrapper for tf.one_hot(), and introduces two
main, backwards compatible, improvements, as mentioned in #1799:

The parameters on_value and off_value now have default values 1 and 0
respectively, as 32-bit integers. Because the most common use case of
one_hot() is to create Tensors for one-hot encoding, it will save users
some headache to not have to manually type in these values by hand each
time it is used. The parameters can still be given different values as
before, and this does not any previous behavior.
indices and depth no longer have to be cast by hand as int64 and
int32 values, respectively. Previously, one_hot() would complain if
these values weren't of the exact right type- it now casts the values to
the appropriate type on its own.

Pinging @ebrevdo for review.
