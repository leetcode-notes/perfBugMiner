added //tensorflow/cc:cc_ops to //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so

Hey, I've wrapped tensorflow into openframeworks (http://openframeworks.cc/ ) was a massive PITA but more on that later :)
I needed the c++ ops so I added that to the libtensorflow.so target. I believe this is the right way to do it?
(I can confirm that it does work, I can create graphs in openframeworks. I'll make it all public once i've ironed out a few other things)
