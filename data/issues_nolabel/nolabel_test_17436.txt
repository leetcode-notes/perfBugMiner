Describe the problem
When building TF 1.6 from source on ppc64 we see the following error (bug):
gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-march=native'
TensorFlow 1.6 build on ppc64le does not work, because on ppc64le we would need -mcpu=native.
Source code / logs
Seems like there is some handling for ppc64le in configure.py , however this commit c9885ea seems to set -march=native instead of -mcpu=native for ppc64le ...
Would be great if someone could have a look at it - Thank you very much!
