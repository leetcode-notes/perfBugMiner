Fix alignment crashes in AVX512 builds

This pull request fixes alignment crashes on AVX512 builds seen when running the tensorflow unit tests.  It modifies tensorflow/core/framework/allocator.h so that kAllocatorAlignment is always 64 and sets the eigen define EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES to 64.  It also updates some of the compiler unit tests so that they pass with these new settings.
The first patch in the PR was originally submitted by fenrus75 in #15606.
