Tensorflow Retrain Model performance

I am using Tensorflow for poet guide for train own model. I have create retrained_graph.pb and retrained_labels.txt. While I use it in application then I get error that
Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is not available in GraphDef version 21. It has been removed in version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization(). at org.tensorflow.Graph.importGraphDef(Native Method) at org.tensorflow.Graph.importGraphDef(Graph.java:118)
After That  further train model for application use Tensorflow for mobile   blog and create optimized_graph.pb, rounded_graph.pb, mmapped_graph.pb files.
optimized_graph.pb and rounded_graph.pb file work in android application without any error.
While use mmapped_graph.pb I get error that Failed to initialize: java.io.IOException: Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization: Invalid GraphDef
Performance of application is not good while use optimized_graph.pb and rounded_graph.pb file.While application camera screen not contain any flower photos otherwise random flower name show with high confidence rate. Any way to detect only flower and remain blank when not flowers.
