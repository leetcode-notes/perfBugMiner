Question about r1.5's default ptxas GPU back-end

From TF r1.5's release notes, it is said that "GPU back-end now uses ptxas to compile generated PTX."  I have searched through the entire git repo of r1.5 code base with only finding that ptxas will be invoked in XLA flow.
Since we are working on some XLA and GPU optimization stuffs, I just want to make sure the meaning of this sentence since I am a little bit puzzle about it and want to ensure our development flow will align with the community major direction.
Thanks
