Feature Request : inline graph visualization for ipython

Building TensorFlow graphs is much easier when done in an interactive environment like ipython.
Would be nice to have an interactive display of the current graph inline in ipython using something like mpld3. Another simpler possibility would be to just output an image of the current graph (no interactivity).
