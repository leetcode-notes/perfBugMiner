Constant operation "forgets" about incoming shape

Feature request
Following this question in StackOverflow: Why can't tensorflow determine the shape of this expression.
When using a constant tensor (tf.zeros, tf.ones, tf.constant...), if one of the input dimension is unknown, the operation will forget every dimension of the input.
The code will be clearer:
input_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 32])
batch_size = tf.shape(input_tensor)[0]

res = tf.zeros((batch_size, 128))
print res.get_shape()  # prints (?, ?) WHEREAS one could expect (?, 128)
The easy fix is to set the output shape by hand:
res.set_shape([None, 128])
print res.get_shape()  # prints (?, 128)
However, this could be done directly in the TensorFlow code. Otherwise, it may confuse users that think their shape is fully defined.
