Add str(Label(...)) to bazel macros

This is a similar pull request to
#14737
but for r1.4 branch, not master.
When using tensorflow as a submodule in bazel, importing bazel rules from tensorflow.bzl is not working.
The main reason is that some of the dependencies are hard coded instead of using str(Label(...)) and this makes bazel to generate dependencies like
//tensorflow
instead of
@org_tensorflow//tensorflow.
Most of bzl files under tensorflow use Label mechanism to allow supermodule to import tensorflow bazel rules like tf_cc_test, etc, but there were two files that did not use the Label mechanism and these two files block supermodule to import tensorflow bazel rules. This change updates those files to unblock bazel rule importing.
