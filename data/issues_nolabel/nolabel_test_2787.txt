0.9rc0 regression when using scan over axes with shape None

A simple cumulative sum with scan that worked in TF 0.8 fails in 0.9rc0 with an inconsistent shape error. I have attached code to illustrate the error below. Basically, a scan over the 0th axis fails when a different axis has None shape. This occurs, for example, when computing a cumulative sum over an arbitrary axis of a minibatched variable (after first transposing that axis to be in the 0th position).

Steps to reproduce
Run the following code:
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, 2])
xT = tf.transpose(x)
# scan over dimension 0 (with shape None)
result = tf.scan(lambda a, x: a + x, x)
# scanned over transposed dimension 0 (with shape 2)
resultT = tf.scan(lambda a, x: a + x, xT)
To see the following error:
ValueError: Inconsistent shapes: saw (?,) but expected (?,) (and infer_shape=True)
