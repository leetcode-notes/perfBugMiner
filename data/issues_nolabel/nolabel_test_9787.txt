Added TensorBoard to the keras.callbacks API

When porting my code from Keras to use tensorflow.contrib.keras, I found that I couldn't use the TensorBoard callback anymore. Even though the code is still present, it was removed from the API __init__.py file during the port by @fchollet.
I couldn't find it in the commit history but I assume there was a reason to not bring along TensorBoard right away. This PR is a request for this feature and I'll happily help wherever I can to bring it about.
