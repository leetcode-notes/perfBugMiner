Feature Request: Named global_step

I have been developing GAN models for some time now and I find it useful to track the individual stages (pretraining of generator/discriminator, adversarial training) in different global_steps so I can save and restore my actual progress without doing a lot of calculations based on configured training steps and so on.
Therefore, I have basically rebuild the functionality that tf.train.get_or_create_global_step provides but with support for named global_steps.
Looks something like tf.train.get_or_create_global_step(graph, name).
Am I the only one finding this particularly helpful?
