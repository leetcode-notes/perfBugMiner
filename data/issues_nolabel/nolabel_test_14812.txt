segmentation fault due to pytorch and tensorflow conflictions

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No.


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): from Anaconda, with command:
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.4.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl


TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-rc1-11-g130a514 1.4.0


Python version: 3.5.4


Bazel version (if compiling from source): -


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -


CUDA/cuDNN version: cuda 8.0


GPU model and memory: TITAN Xp, 12G


Exact command to reproduce:
This fails:


>>> import torch
>>> import tensorflow as tf
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Describe the problem
I am using pytorch version 0.2.0_4, for python 3.5, with cuda support. I installed it from the following command:
conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith
When I use tensorflow alone, it works fine; i.e., doing an import like
>>> import tensorflow as tf
has no problem. Also, Importing tensorflow before torch seems fine as well.
However if I import pytorch before tensorflow, it fails and reported a segmentation error (as shown above).
