Executor failed to create kernel Snapshot, compiled from source using contrib/makefile

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): slightly modified code of label_image/main.cc
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): linux ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): compiled from source using contrib/makefile just for CPU
TensorFlow version (use command below): the latest r1.7
Python version: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):  5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
I created a c++ project slightly modified from label_image/main.cc, and compiled the code in qtcreator against -ltensorflow_cc -ltensorflow_framework (compiled from source using bazel) with no problems. Then I added all necessary ops to tf_op_files.txt and successfully compiled libtensorflow_core.a using contrib/makefile. Linking this static lib -ltensorflow_core to my code, my code returned at
Div(root, Sub(root, resized, ...), std ) (pseudo code)
with error

I found a similar post #17752 to this problem, but branch r1.7 with the fix d392b1c for windows doesn't solve my problem.
My own PB model file was created a while ago using tools compiled from r1.5, will this be the problem?
