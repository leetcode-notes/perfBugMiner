Add batch support for various image_ops

Working on #8926
I used #7369 as a guide for my work here.
I have added batch support for:

flip_left_right
flip_up_down
random_flip_left_right
random_flip_up_down
transpose_image
rot90

I have corrected existing tests in image_ops_test.py and introduced a number of new tests based on existing tests for 3D inputs.
This is my first contribution to this repository and I have tried to follow the contributing guidelines. However, running pylint on image_ops_impl.py and image_ops_test.py revealed a number of pre-existing style violations. I've tried to fix the ones relevant to my work but may have missed some.
