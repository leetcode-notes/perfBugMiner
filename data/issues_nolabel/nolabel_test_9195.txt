Enable protobuf's --with-pic option

This PR only applies to contrib/makefile project.
libtensorflow-core.a static library is built with position independent code (i.e., -fPIC option), however, libprotobuf.a static library is not. This MR enables the protobuf's --with-pic option in order to be able to use libprotobuf.a when building a shared library.
