Dose Titan Xp work in Windows10?

Hi i bought new GPU - Titan Xp for learning, so i set the system like below:
CPU-AMD Ryzen 51600 Six-Core Processor
GPU-Titan Xp
Tensorflow-1.5.0 GPU
CUDA-9.0
cuDNN-7.0
But i found that when the calculation begins, the data looks not stacked on GPU, so that it occurs error message.
does Titan XP work in Windows 10 to use tensorflow gpu?
