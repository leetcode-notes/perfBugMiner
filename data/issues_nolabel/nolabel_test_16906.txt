python 3.6 + latest tf = infinity of "msgpack_numpy.py:142 PendingDeprecationWarning: encoding is deprecated."

Symptom, trying to train resnet-50 imagenet @ppwwyyxx 's imagenet-resnet.py script fails to start after 5 minutes, because of some thread being blocked trying to flush a gazillion of warning messages above
Since this problem is solved by downgrading from "tf-nightly-gpu" (1.7.0-dev20180208) to tensorflow-gpu 1.5, TensorFlow must be blame for introducing a new usage of this deprecated method. Unfortunately the warning messages are quite uninformative, with no indication of who is calling this :/
Note that Python 3.6 is the only Python 3 version supported on Amazon Deep Learning conda AMI images.
Warning messages look like this:
