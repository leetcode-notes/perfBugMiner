Frame of the Variable

Hello
I am using tf.scan for implementing memory augmented network and when trying to run tf.initialize_all_variables() getting the error about frame of the variables:
All inputs to node scan_1/while/Variable_13/Assign must be from the same frame.

As I understood this frame is some inner identification of the variables, so what should I do to get rid of this error? Scan works if I do not define any variables outside the step, but I need at least weights-biases and loss-accuracy variables.
