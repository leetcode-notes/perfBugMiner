scikit flow - race condition when trying to fit

I'm probably missing something obvious but I did a fresh build tonight and when trying to run the MNIST examples, every time I run them I'm getting the below errors. I have tried a few of the examples and can't seem to get around it (even when updating the depreciated bits still in the examples.) Am I missing something?
Code:
`
from future import absolute_import
from future import division
from future import print_function
from sklearn import metrics
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import learn
import numpy as np
Download and load MNIST data.
mnist = learn.datasets.load_dataset('mnist')
y = np.array(mnist.train.labels, dtype='int32')
Linear classifier.
feature_columns = learn.infer_real_valued_columns_from_input(mnist.train.images)
classifier = learn.TensorFlowLinearClassifier(
feature_columns=feature_columns, n_classes=10, batch_size=100, steps=1000,
learning_rate=0.01)
classifier.fit(mnist.train.images,y)
score = metrics.accuracy_score(
mnist.test.labels, classifier.predict(mnist.test.images))
print('Accuracy: {0:f}'.format(score))
`
