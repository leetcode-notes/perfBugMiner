Implemented sinh and cosh

These commits contains the implementation of the sinh and cosh functions for CPU and GPU with gradients. This solves #7531 partially. The supported datatypes are float, double, complex64 and complex128.
Compilation went through successfully on my system (CPU only) and the following test script seems to be running fine on Python 2.7
from __future__ import print_function
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = tf.placeholder(shape=[None, 5], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.placeholder(shape=[None, 5], dtype=tf.float32)

W = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform(shape=[5,5], dtype=tf.float32))
w = tf.cosh(W)
error = tf.reduce_mean((tf.matmul(x, w) - y)**2)
train = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(1e-2).minimize(error)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
for i in range(100):
    tmp_x = np.random.rand(10, 5)
    tmp_y = np.random.rand(10, 5)

    sess.run(train, feed_dict={x:tmp_x, y:tmp_y})
print(sess.run(W))
