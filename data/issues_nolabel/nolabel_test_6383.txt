I am trying to build an Android example using Bazel on Windows.
I've successfully installed Bazel using Chocolatey.
Following the build instructions, I need to change the SDK and NDK paths in WORKSPACE file and run:
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
I am having trouble with configuring the WORKSPACE file. I need to uncomment the Android lines and add the paths.  However, no matter what I try, I get an error.
I've tried:
**

path = "C:/Users/Andrey/AppData/Local/Android/sdk"
path = "/C/Users/Andrey/AppData/Local/Android/sdk"
path = "C:\Users\Andrey\AppData\Local\Android\sdk"
path = "C:\Users\Andrey\AppData\Local\Android\sdk"**

For 1,2,4 I am getting:
ERROR: C:/Tools/tensorflow-master/WORKSPACE:3:1: indentation error.
ERROR: error loading package 'external': Failed to parse WORKSPACE file.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.317s
For 3 I am getting:
ERROR: C:/Tools/tensorflow-master/WORKSPACE:9:12: escape sequence not implemented: \U.
ERROR: C:/Tools/tensorflow-master/WORKSPACE:14:10: escape sequence not implemented: \U.
ERROR: C:/Tools/tensorflow-master/WORKSPACE:3:1: indentation error.
ERROR: error loading package 'external': Failed to parse WORKSPACE file.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.309s
There is a hint that it is related to indentation, but I could not find anything problematic.
I am attaching an example file for (1)
WORKSPACE_1.txt
(Note: I change the extension to .txt since I could not upload the original file.)
Any idea?
