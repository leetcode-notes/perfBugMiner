using TensorFlow on Windows Server 2012

I'm using TensorFlow on Windows Server 2012, TensorFlow version is 0.12.1
I've install CUDA (CUDA Version 8.0.44), and install cuDnn (cuDNN v5.1 (August 10, 2016), for CUDA 8.0).
that cuDnn is build for windows 10.
But when I run my tensorflow code is get some error about:
am_executor\cuda\cuda_dnn.cc:385] could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_IN
TERNAL_ERROR
E c:\tf_jenkins\home\workspace\release-win\device\gpu\os\windows\tensorflow\stre

AD_PARAM
F c:\tf_jenkins\home\workspace\release-win\device\gpu\os\windows\tensorflow\core
\kernels\conv_ops.cc:532] Check failed: stream->parent()->GetConvolveAlgorithms(
&algorithms)

It seems the cuDNN version is not correct, but I tried cuDNN v5.0, also got this exception.
does anyone know how to fix this issue?
Thanks very much.
