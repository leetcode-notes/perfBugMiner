Determinant-operation on the GPU

This pull request implements the computation of the matrix determinant on the GPU using LU-factorization with cuSolver.
This is the second part of the use-case presented in pull request #11878 .
It uses the LU factorization instead of QR-factorization, because this allows to compute the determinant also for non-symmetric matrices. This is required by the definition of the operation in Tensorflow. Hence, I also had to implement the LU-interface to cuSolver, QR would have already been implemented.
Two further notes:
First, the precision of this algorithm to compute the determinant is less precise than the Eigen-implementation. Hence I had to relax the allowed error in the unit test. This is especially important for singular or near-singular matrices.
Second, if this pull request and #11878 will both be accepted, they will probably clash in cuda_solvers.h and/or cuda_solvers.cc. I'll resolve the conflicts if it happens to be so.
