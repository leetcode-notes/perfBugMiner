"grep: AVX: No such file or directory" -> importing tensorflow libraries in python, on mac

When I try to import tensorflow in python, under python2.7 or 3 I get the following error output, it loads fine, but the errors are annoying.. (Also running in bash terminal if that matters...)
grep: AVX: No such file or directory
grep: 10.9.: No such file or directory
I thought it might be an issue with the specific version of grep on the mac os so I updated to the latest grep using brew, and now I get this error...
grep: warning: GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated; please use an alias or script
grep: AVX: No such file or directory
grep: warning: GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated; please use an alias or script
grep: 10.9.: No such file or directory
which is going in the opposite direction I was hoping to. Is anyone else getting this? Is there a fix? Much appreciated any help on this, have no clue if this is just something I need to live with on a mac, or if I can find a way to fix it.
Should also mention i am using version 1.0.1 of tensorflow which I got running this command from above... python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)"
Installed tensorflow using
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
for python 3 for instance.
