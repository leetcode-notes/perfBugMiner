Does inception model detect multiple object in one image?

I have use retrain.py to train tensorflow with my own dataset of traffic sign but it seems it doesn't capture multi-object in one image.I am using the label_image.py to detect the object in my image.I have an image of two road sign which exists in my dataset but i get only one sign with high accuracy.It doesn't detect other sign.
