maybe a big bug of save/restore on python3

tensorflow version:
v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5 1.1.0
python version:
3.6.1
No GPU.
I use
saver.save(sess, './model/')
and
saver.restore(sess, './model/')
but
saver.restore doesn't work.The predict result changes at every time.And at Python2.7 the predict result stay the same.
At first,I think it was the problem of windows.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43630048/tensorflow-save-restore-a-model-in-windows
