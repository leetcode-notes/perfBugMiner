Tensorflow GRU error when trying to concatenate activations to outputs

I have been trying to grab the activations of the GRU cell layer in the following manner
def __call__(self, inputs, state, scope=None):
    """Gated recurrent unit (GRU) with nunits cells."""
    with vs.variable_scope(scope or type(self).__name__):  # "GRUCell"
      with vs.variable_scope("Gates"):  # Reset gate and update gate.
        # We start with bias of 1.0 to not reset and not update.
        r, u = array_ops.split(1, 2, linear([inputs, state], 2 * self._num_units, True, 1.0))
        r, u = sigmoid(r), sigmoid(u)
      with vs.variable_scope("Candidate"):
        c = tanh(linear([inputs, r * state], self._num_units, True))
      new_h = u * state + (1 - u) * c

      # store the activations, everything else is the same
      h_activations = array_ops.concat(1, [new_h,r,u,c])
    return h_activations, h_activations

Later I try to grab the activations in the following way
cell = ClusterableGRUCell(num_units=hidden_neurons) initial_state = tf.zeros([batch_size, cell.state_size]) outputs_activations, outputs_activations = rnn.rnn(cell=cell, inputs=x, initial_state=initial_state, sequence_length=s) outputs_activations = tf.concat(0, outputs_activations) outputs, rs, us, cs = tf.split(1, 4, outputs_activations) activations = tf.concat(1, [rs, us, cs])
However this fails in the rnn() step with the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: Shapes (32, 33) and (32, 132) are not compatible
My batch size is 32 and number of neurons is 33, 132 = 33*4 which makes sense. What I dont understand is why is there a lingering (32,33) tensor? Thank you.
