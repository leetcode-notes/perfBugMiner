Error for Mac El-capitan while installing tensorflow GPU version on CUDA 8.0

Below is the error I am getting when I import tensorflow:
import tensorflow
Traceback (most recent call last):

I don't understand why it is asking for libcudart.7.5.dylib when I have installed CUDA 8.0. Theano is working perfectly fine for me on GPU but tensorflow is not. Any help would be appreciated. I have exactly followed the steps mentioned on tensorflow website. I also tried disabling SIP protection in El-capitan as mentioned in other similar github issues but no luck.
