[WIP] Clean shell scripts

Hi,
I started to fix various things spotted by ShellCheck.
I used the following command: find -O3 . -type f -name '*.sh' -exec shellcheck -x {} \;.
There are quite a lot of things remaining:
find -O3 . -type f -name '*.sh' -exec shellcheck -x {} \; | wc -l
3731
I'll fix all of them in a few days. But to ease the process of reviewing, I open the PR now, and will add a new commit each time. At the end, I'll merge all of them in a single commit.
