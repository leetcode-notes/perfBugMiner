Fix expand_dims of dim argument has been deprecated with axis

This PR is to fix tf.expand_dims of dim argument has been deprecated with axis.
As we can see from array_ops.expand_dims#L147, the dim argument of array_ops.expand_dims has been deprecated and in favor of axis.
Besides, we can see from tf.expand_dims as below: axis/ dim should be scalar type instead of list/ tuple.
