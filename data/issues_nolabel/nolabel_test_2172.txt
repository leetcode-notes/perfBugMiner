Blacklist py tests in python/platform/default

These tests are superseded by the corresponding ones in python/platform
in the OSS tests. They are currently used only internally and will be
eventually removed in the future.
This PR also fixes a bug in test_installation.sh that could cause infinite
loops in certain cases.
