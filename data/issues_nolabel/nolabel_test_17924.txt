[tensorflow] Android studio doesn't fetch setUseNNAPI

in build.gradle below dependency will not download
latest file of ./tensorflow/contrib/lite/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/Interpreter.java
dependencies {
compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:+'
}
Hence we are getting unresolved symbol for new API setUseNNAPI
as gradle unable to download new API as below
/** Turns on/off Android NNAPI for hardware acceleration when it is available. */
public void setUseNNAPI(boolean useNNAPI) {
if (wrapper != null) {
wrapper.setUseNNAPI(useNNAPI);
} else {
throw new IllegalStateException("NativeInterpreterWrapper has already been closed.");
}
}
