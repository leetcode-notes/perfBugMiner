a bug in tensorflow/core/graph/gradient.cc

in the above file, i think that in line 257 there is a error
for (const Edge* e : y->in_edges()) {
if (e->IsControlEdge()) continue;
BackpropAlongEdge(y_grad_node_outputs_[i], { e->src(), e->src_output() });
}
i think y->in_edges() should be y->out_edges(). please check this out as soon as possible, thank you
