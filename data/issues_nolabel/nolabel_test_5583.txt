error duing running transflow model

I am following this tutorial:  But as i try to run the loader.cc file after succesfully building it, i get this error: Not found: models/train.pb
I have already copyed the train.pb file into /transflow/transflow/model folder and i also tried to copy this file inside /transflow/bazel-bin/model but it is locked. So how do i remove this error. even after i unlocked the bazel folder and than copied the train.pb file inside models, it shows the same error.
