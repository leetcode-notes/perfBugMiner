Reopening #9294 error in RNN tutorial

Thanks to @kevinashaw for pointing out various problems with the RNN tensorflow tutorial
Although the issue was closed, as far as I can see @MarkDaoust @drpngx @ebrevdo @martinwicke
the tutorial code posted here and at TF site still has the same errors after nearly 12 months
I did try making some of the modifications suggested in the thread, they don't appear to solve the issue
Have I written custom code: NO
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10;
Python v. 3.5
TensorFlow installed from: Anaconda
TensorFlow version 1.2.0
GPU model and memory: CPU 16GB of RAM
Exact command to reproduce (see below)
Xin =tf.random_normal((100,100))

batch_size_var  = tf.shape(Xin)[0]
lstm = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(lstm_size)
hidden_state = lstm_cells.zero_state(batch_size_var, tf.float32) 
current_state = lstm_cells.zero_state(batch_size_var, tf.float32)

There was a suggestion to use  dynamic rnn . It wasnt fully explained but using  dynamic rnn renders the reference to .LSTMCell  invalid
Is there another RNN tutorial or a revised version anyone can recommend?
