GPU not working on C++

I'm on working on load trained model in c++ like this.
After many tries, I've manage to load trained model with its weights. But it looks like c++ version doesn't use GPU for inference. While running my code in c++, I check GPU usage using nvidia-smi and there is no change in GPU usage. After close looking at the example code in /tensorflow/cc/tutorials/example_trainer.cc and this, I've tried assigning device to each node like below. But still, no GPU usage in nvidia-smi and actual running time is horribly slow. BTW, there is no problem using GPU if it is running on python.
`  const std::string device = "/gpu:0";
std::vector vNames;
int node_count = graph_def.node_size();
for (int i = 0; i < node_count; i++) {
auto n = graph_def.node(i);
if (n.name().find("nWeights") != std::string::npos) {
vNames.push_back(n.name());
std::cout << n.name() << std::endl;
}
auto node = graph_def.mutable_node(i);
node->set_device(device);
}`
