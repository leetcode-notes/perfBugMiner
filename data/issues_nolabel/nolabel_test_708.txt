ConcatOp error text change

I think this message was meant to be ended with a ] but I am uncertain if that notation is clear.
Before this change, the script:
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.concat(0, [1, 2, 3]))
Throws the following exception:

InvalidArgumentError: ConcatOp : Expected concatenating dimensions in the range [0, 0**)**, but got 0

After this change the output is:

InvalidArgumentError: ConcatOp : Expected concatenating dimensions in the range [0, 0**]***, but got 0
