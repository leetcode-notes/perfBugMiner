Describe the problem

I am trying to use TF-Lite visualization tool to create a graph image on the toco quantized model. However, it dose not work.
I am also tried to use visualize.py to create the html file, but it can not create the corresponding JSON file of the model. It seems that the binary file of "flatc" cannot be found.

Source code / logs

using toco command line tools to converting and quantizing TF model to TF-Lite model
using bazel to build and run TF-Lite visualizer


bazel run tensorflow/contrib/lite/tools:visualize -- quant_mobilenet_v1_infer.tflite quant_mobilenet_v1_infer.html

However, I got error info:

RuntimeError: Invalid filename 'quant_mobilenet_v1_infer.tflite'
ERROR: Non-zero return code '1' from command: Process exited with status 1

which is caused by CreateHtmlFile function in visualize.py
