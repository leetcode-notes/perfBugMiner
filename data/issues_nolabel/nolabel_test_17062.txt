Change Kernel dimension(height * width * input_channel * output_channel) to NCHW format

First of all, it seems that no one tries this due to the fact that I couldn't get any answers from stackoverflow or googling.
I'm trying to use cudnn inside the custom op.
Basically, custom op receives kernel layout (height * width * input_channel * output_channel).
But, according to cudnn policy, kernel layout has to be (output_channel * input_channel * height * width) inside custom op. But, I couldn't find anything regarding this issues.
Are there any solutions for converting layout like this(HWCN to NCHW)?
