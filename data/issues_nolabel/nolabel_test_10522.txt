np.float64("np.inf").astype(np.int32) is negative on x86 but positive on ppc64le

np.float64("np.inf").astype(np.int32) is negative on x86 but positive on ppc64le, that is the reason we
added this special case for ppc64le


Discussed with numpy community and they mentioned as follows -



Doing this cast incurs undefined behaviour, so it's hard to say which platform is incorrect here.
I'd argue that we should just issue a warning and leave the platform-specific behaviour.
This is also true of any C program that tries to cast float to int. If the author of a python package
included a C extension that does this cast, they still have the problem.
The same argument you use for "we should fix this is numpy, not in the user package" can be
applied to "we should fix this in C, not in numpy". Presumably for speed reasons, that argument was
rejected during the  design of C.
Having said that, we already diverge from C behaviour in some place (eg, integer promotion for
arithmetic and comparison), so it wouldn't be unreasonable  to add special casing here.
