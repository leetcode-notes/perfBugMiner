what is op 'Switch' in RNN?

I build a two-layer RNN (GRU) network using tf.nn.dynamic_rnn with argument sequence_length. Then the graph contains an op 'Switch' which I haven't seen before.
919 node {
920   name: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/Assert/AssertGuard/Switch"
921   op: "Switch"
922   input: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/All"
923   input: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/All"
924   attr {
925     key: "T"
926     value {
927       type: DT_BOOL
928     }
929   }
I need to do inference in android and it complains this op is not registered in kernel files. I wonder what it is and there should be a python wrap or .cc file to implement this I guess.
