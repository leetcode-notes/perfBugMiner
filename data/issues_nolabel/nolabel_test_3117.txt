Android Tensorflow Crashes w/ Custom Graph

Solved: Followed steps at the bottom of #1269
And the app works fine!

Steps to reproduce

Followed Tensorflow for Poets tutorial (OK!) used --config=cuda and --use_gpu to speed up process
Create new graph and labels and test to see if it can classify new image (OK!)
Try to build tensorflow_demo.apk using new graph and labels with modifications to:

TensorflowImageListener.java
  // These are the settings for the original v1 Inception model. If you want to
  // use a model that's been produced from the TensorFlow for Poets codelab,
  // you'll need to set IMAGE_SIZE = 299 **_# do they mean INPUT_SIZE?_**, IMAGE_MEAN = 128, IMAGE_STD = 128,
  // INPUT_NAME = "Mul:0", and OUTPUT_NAME = "final_result:0".
  // You'll also need to update the MODEL_FILE and LABEL_FILE paths to point to
  // the ones you produced.
  private static final int NUM_CLASSES = 5;
  private static final int INPUT_SIZE = 299;
  private static final int IMAGE_SIZE = 299; **_# i added this line in / confused about instructions_**
  private static final int IMAGE_MEAN = 128;
  private static final float IMAGE_STD = 128;
  private static final String INPUT_NAME = "Mul:0";
  private static final String OUTPUT_NAME = "final_result:0";

  private static final String MODEL_FILE = "file:///android_asset/retrained_graph.pb";
  private static final String LABEL_FILE =
"file:///android_asset/retrained_labels.txt";

// I moved files into /tensorflow/examples/android/assets



Do bazel build and adb devices install


Launch app and it crashes everytime


What have you tried?

I restored TensorflowImageListener.java to it's original state and the app works fine.
