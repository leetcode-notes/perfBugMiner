How to check/enlarge computer memory in Mac OS when running .py code?

Hi everyone,
I'm new to python, and learning tensorflow recently on my mac OS X Yosemite system with 8g memory. I'm using anaconda with tensorflow installed within it. When trying some demo codes, I found they run very slowly.
I've saw somewhere previously that python only use 2g (or 1g? sorry I cannot remember clearly) memory in Mac OS since it was installed in virtual environment, so one can enlarge the memory to 8g to speed up the programme by using just several command lines.
Unfortunately I  cannot find out that webpage now. Does anyone have idea how to do this? Thanks a lot!
