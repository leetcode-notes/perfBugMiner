Improve tf.constant() for float16 with fast_tensor_util

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #19180 where tf.constant() for float16 is too slow as there is no
fast_tensor_util support.
This fix adds fast_tensor_util by casting float16 to uint16. Since numpy natively stores float16 as uint16, the conversion should be ok.
This fix fixes #19180.
