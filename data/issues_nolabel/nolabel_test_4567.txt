tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh fails to parse workspace.bzl

Hi,
In download_dependencies.sh we grep tensorflow/workspace.bzl in order to determine which Eigen to download. We do this using the command grep -o 'http.*bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/.*tar\.gz' tensorflow/workspace.bzl which we then proceed to try and curl and untar (ln22).
Due to the new format of workspace.bzl, that grep returns http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/" + eigen_version + ".tar.gz which will download a 404 from bitbucket. Can we please update the makefile to account for this?
Thanks,
Tomas
