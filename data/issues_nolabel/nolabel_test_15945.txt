DataLossError when loading saved model from r1.4 (Unable to read file ... failed to seek to header entry)

I have a few saved models stored, these were built using version 1.2.0-rc1
When I try to load any of these saved models using version 1.4.1, I get the following error:

I was able to load the same models in version 1.2.0-rc1.
I tried building a new saved model using version 1.4.1 , that I was able to load in both versions without any problems.
The versions I tested were both built, without cuda.
