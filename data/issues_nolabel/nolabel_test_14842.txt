Update .gitignore files for Android Studio

Without these, Git shows lots of noisy build/IDE config files.
These files are based on these two sources (plus the list of added files that Git shows when I build in Android Studio):
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore
https://github.com/github/gitignore/pull/2103/files
Tested in Android Studio 3.0 Beta 2.
