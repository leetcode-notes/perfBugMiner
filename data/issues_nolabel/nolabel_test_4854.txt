Can we ignore 'tensorflow.python.framework.errors.DataLossError: corrupted record at 0'

I will face this problem when reading tf records on hdfs, may be running one hour or two hours, then my program will crash down due to this assertion fail from tensorflow c++ code.
Can we just ignore this, ie. ignore the batch with DataLossErro, so can continue training next batch without having to stop the program.
