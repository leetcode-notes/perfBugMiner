Fixing mac-pip builds

The --system-site-package option flag in PR 1472 broke Mac pip builds due to existing packages on the system. For example, see: http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Experimental/job/experimental-cais-tensorflow-mac-python2-copt_both/17/console
Generally speaking, the --system-site-package option makes the virtualenv environment depend on the packages on the Mac host. Removing the option gets rid of this dependency and the need to maintain the host packages, which will save work (especially if there are multiple Mac slaves).
The cost of installing the packages in the virtualenv should be minimal for both Mac and Linux, now that we cache the virtualenv folder by default.
The PR has been tested manually for both python2 and python3 on Mac. See:
