External optimizer with apply_gradients

Hi all,
I'm trying to define some new optimization algorithm. I found an interface about external optimizer here, it says that i need to subclass it and implement _minimize. However I need to call apply_gradients when using the external optimizer. Does anyone know how can i implement it?
Thanks.
