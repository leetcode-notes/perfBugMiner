Download of test data not working

The get started part has a section MNIST for ML Beginners. In this tutorial you should download the test data via:
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True)
Unfortunately that's not working because of an connection error.
