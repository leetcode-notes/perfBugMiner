r0.10: function 'repository_rule' does not exist

Hi,
I previously installed tensorflow 0.8 and 0.9 on a GPU cluster with several local patches to circumvent non-standard paths for crosstool files and swig. Our users are now requesting an upgrade to 0.10 but I have the following error... Installing tensorflow on a cluster is so painful....
ERROR: ~/tensorflow_0.10/tensorflow/third_party/gpus/cuda_configure.bzl:415:18: function 'repository_rule' does not exist.
I suppose this is related to bazel. repository_rule is an experimental feature of bazel. What version of bazel is required to install 0.10? bazel is also painful to install to so we try to avoid upgrades as much as possible. This is very costly in terms of sys admin time.
