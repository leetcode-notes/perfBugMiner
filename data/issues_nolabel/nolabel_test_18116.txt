ImportError : Could not find 'msvcp140.dll'

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Window 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary

Problem
I am using python 3.6 and have successfully installed tensorflow 1.7 via pip3 command. While importing tensorflow in python interpreter an OSError occurs and while handling the exception ImportError also occurs which gives the message that 'Couldnot find msvcp140.dll'. I checked that the dll files are present in the directory that is in the PATH variable and also installed the Visual C++ Redistributable as mentioned.
