build_pip_package fails with locally installed python3: script unsets LD_LIBRARY_PATH

build_pip_package fails here with
ERROR: /path/to/src/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/example/BUILD:38:1: Executing genrule //tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/example:half_plus_two failed: bash failed: error executing command
caused by
error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.5m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
executing
(cd path/to/execroot/tensorflow && \ exec env - \ PATH=somepath \ /bin/bash -c 'source external/bazel_tools/tools/genrule/genrule-setup.sh; rm -rf /tmp/half_plus_two; path_to/python3 bazel-out/host/bin/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/example/export_half_plus_two
it looks like
exec env -
unsets LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and therefore python3 cannot find its libraries anymore
Installation of tensorflow 0.8 works
