tensorflow/tools/git script breaks when git repo has packed references

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Not applicable to bug
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source build
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tip of tree
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version:
n/a
GPU model and memory:
n/a
Exact command to reproduce:

git pack-refs
git gc
bazel clean
configure
bazel build -c opt --copt=-g --copt=-mavx --copt=-msse4.2 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package


Results:

ERROR: /local/chip/git/tensorflow-knureon/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1404:1: no such target '//tensorflow/tools/git:gen/branch_ref': target 'gen/branch_ref' not declared in package 'tensorflow/tools/git' defined by /local/chip/git/tensorflow-knureon/tensorflow/tools/git/BUILD and referenced by '//tensorflow/core:version_info_gen'.
ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted.

The problem is due to the fact that the link in tensorflow/tools/git/gen/branch_ref is supposed to point to a valid file in my .git directory: .git/refs/heads/tf-tip.  However, I have been doing some reorganizing of our tree structure, and in the process of removing deprecated branches my calls to git caused this file to be deleted.  So the .git/refs/heads directory is empty and the hash is found in .git/packed-refs:
rdubielzig@swpl-000224:/local/chip/git/tensorflow-knureon/.git$ grep tf-tip packed-refs
5049653 refs/heads/tf-tip
WORKAROUND:
Recreate the missing ref file by writing  'tf-tip' in .git/refs/heads with the contents consisting of the hash above.
