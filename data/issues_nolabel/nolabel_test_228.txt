AttributeError in Tensor

While running workd2vec_basic.py as is, an AttributeError rises when dividing tesors.
AttributeError: type object 'Tensor' has no attribute 'truediv'
Dividing arbitrary tensors inside the console in a python session would not give such error. Maybe multiple class definitions for Tensor?
