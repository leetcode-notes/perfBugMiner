PIP package contains CUDA libraries

As discussed offline: the PIP package size has greatly increased since the cuda_configure change because the CUDA libraries under external/local_config_cuda are now being included by build_pip_package.sh.
The simplest fix for this is to special-case local_config_cuda to exclude it from being copied in build_pip_package.sh since there does not seem to be a way to specifically exclude all files under @local_config_cuda// in the sh_binary rule itself.
The reason why we did not experience this previously is because the CUDA libraries were symlinked under third_party, and build_pip_package.sh rsyncs third_party/eigen3 specifically.
