Fixed fused_batch_norm gradients

Fixed issues with fused_batch_norm as discussed in #4899, added support to 2D tensor for fused_batch_norm and added data_format option for bias_add.
Also the nn.fused_batch_norm op should be able to take minimum epsilon=1e-5. This value is set as  mininum value in cudnn and has been used in several models in slim.nets. At the moment nn.fused_batch_norm throw CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM when epsilon=1e-5, probably due to the numerical/casting error. This pull added epsilon=epsilon+1e-12 in nn.fused_batch_norm (1e-5 + 1e-12 works but 1e-5 + 1e-13 doesn't).
