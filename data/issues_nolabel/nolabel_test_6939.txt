Leave old binaries up?

I've noticed that the binaries for older versions have been taken down. In particular, I need to install 0.11.rc0 and both
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.11.rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
and
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
are 404s. Pretty sure they used to work when 0.11.rc0 was the latest though.
Were they intentionally taken down to prevent people from unwittingly installing older versions? That would be understandable, but it would be really nice if there was an easy way to access older binaries. Greatly looking forward to the release of 1.0, but for the time being there's a nest of dependency conflicts to manage and that's difficult when it's not clear how to install old versions!
