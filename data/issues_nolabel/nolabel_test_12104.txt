Ensure that bazel versions of the form X.Y.Z-mmmmm work correctly

The code in configure.py doesn't allow for bazel versions which identify themselves as X.Y.Z-mmmmm.  This is true for bazel on OS/X installed through homebrew.
Recently some code that checks the version number has appeared, and this is causing configurations built with OS/X homebrew bazel to fail.
