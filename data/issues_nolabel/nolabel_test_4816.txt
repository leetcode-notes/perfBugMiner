tensroflow 0.11rc conflict with boost.python generated so

My application will use both tensorflow and some so generated by boost.python(1.53) running on centos 6.3 with cuda 7.5 and cudnn 4 .
The problem is everything is fine with tensorflow 0.10, but changing to tensorflow 0.11rc, then
I will always face segmentation fault (double free) before the program stop running, especially if using numpy also, and if changing import library sequence  might decrease the chance of facing double free, but still not fully solve the problem.
