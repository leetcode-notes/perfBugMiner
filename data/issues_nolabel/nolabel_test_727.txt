ci_build: improve user handling inside the container

create user home with .bazelrc (this is needed for slaves)
create and use user based on uid instead of user name
add bazel-ci_build-cache to .gitignore
add optional extra ci build parameters (this is good for hacky jobs like git bisect for bazel)
