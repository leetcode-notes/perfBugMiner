Scope subprocess and tempfile imports in tensorflow lite to fix #15410

Fix for #15410
As @aselle mentions in issue #15410: "this has to do with the interface sealing in tensorflow (where we try to prevent exposing symbols unrelated to the interfaces)", one potential fix is to scope the imports to the required toco_convert_protos function.
Validated this issue can be reproduced and fixed by this change.
