GPU Question: dtype supports

According to #9506, gpu currently only supports floats. In NLP tasks however there's no way around looking up the embedding matrix with int-typed indices.
So I wonder if it on your shortlist to extend to int support? If not, how to get around the index-lookup issue? Thanks.
