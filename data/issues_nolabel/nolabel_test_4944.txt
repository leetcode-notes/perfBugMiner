Tensorflow GPU installation fails due to Bazel build

I've been trying to install tensorflow with GPU support using these steps:
http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-accelerated-applications-tensorflow-installation.html
This is the error message that I'm getting when I try to run the bazel build command for building the tensorflow pip package (with the --config-cuda flag set):
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
i get :
The specified --crosstool_top '//third_party/gpus/crosstool:crosstool' is not a valid cc_toolchain_suite rule
What's strange is that if i remove the --config=cuda flag, I don't get the error message while building and I'm able to install tensorflow successfully - but without GPU support.
