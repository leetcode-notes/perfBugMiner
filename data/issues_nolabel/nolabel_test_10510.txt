Remove RewriterConfig from the Python API

RewriterConfig has not made it into a release, and so is not subject to semantic versioning. The API needs a bit of work, so it's not going into 1.2.
In order to minimize disruption to non-Google users (some using tf.RewriterConfig from master) and hold up the 1.2 release as little as possible, the plan is to only remove RewriterConfig from the 1.2 release, but leave it in master. We will then develop a more permanent way to configure Grappler graph rewriting.
