Any clear way to restore saved network and parameters?

I'm using tensorflow-gpu0.12.1 on a linux-minit18 machine.
I found it is very hard to restore the saved network and its parameters. The closest answer is
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33759623/tensorflow-how-to-restore-a-previously-saved-model-python
and
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/state_ops/exporting_and_importing_meta_graphs
I followed the example in the above link using tf.train.import_meta_graph, but it didn't work.
with tf.Session() as sess:
  new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-save-dir/my-model-10000.meta')
  new_saver.restore(sess, 'my-save-dir/my-model-10000')

All I want is something like:
training ...
save_model(model_file)
save_parameters(par_file)
...
predicting...
model = load_model(model_file)
model.load_parameters(par_file)
...
I found similar implementations in Keras or Tensorlayer, etc. I like them because they split the training and predicting tasks and make them independant. In predicting task, I don't have to find and call the same def_network function in training task, which is boring and error prone.
@yaroslavvb says it is on the roadmap, please make it faster. I'd like to test it ASAP!
Many thanks!
