Steps to reproduce

I change the Dockerfile that you have provided to get ubuntu 16.04. i.e. FROM ubuntu:14.04 -> ubuntu:16.04
Also changed to git checkout to 0.9
It was for CPU only, so nothing else has changed regarding GPU setting.

What have you tried?

I change the version back to 14.04, which worked flawlessly.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
Would you let me know if you provide tensorflow Dockerfile for ubuntu 16.04? Soon, I will connect this to Nvidia-docker as well and NVIDIA already provides the ubuntu 16.04 support.
