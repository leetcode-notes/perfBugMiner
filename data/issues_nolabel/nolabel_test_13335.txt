Potential Bug in CUDA implementation of matrix_set_diag on Windows

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10 (64-bit)
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): b'unknown' 1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0 /  cuDNN 6.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB

Describe the problem
I ran into this while trying to run the code at https://github.com/deepmind/dnc. It seems that tf.matrix_set_diag can cause tensorflow to crash when run on GPU under Windows. I am able to run other complex models on GPU so it seems as though my environment is configured correctly for CUDA.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 16
num_writes = 1
memory_size = 16

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    link = tf.Variable(tf.ones([batch_size, num_writes, memory_size, memory_size], dtype=tf.float32))
    test_op = tf.matrix_set_diag(link,tf.zeros([batch_size, num_writes, memory_size],dtype=tf.float32))

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
print(sess.run(test_op))

The log from running with cuda-memcheck shows what looks like an issue with a null pointer buried deep inside Eigen...
