fused_batch_norm throws ValueError for partially known 2D-Tensor

I'm trying to use the new fused_batch_norm layer (as I also have this problem #3290)
Using it for 4D Tensors works fine so far (as in: it doens't crash)
However, when using 2D Tensors ([None, X]) I get this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Same code works for the normal batch_norm layer.
Also works if I reshape it manually to [None, 1, 1, X] before calling fused_batch_norm
