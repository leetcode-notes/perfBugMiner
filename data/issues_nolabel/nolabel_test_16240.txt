graph_metrics.py does not work well

I want to use function in graph_metrics.py, I run corresponding test file graph_metrics_test.py, but I get the following assertion error for "weight_parameters" metric

line 32, in testGraphMetrics
    self.assertEqual(expected[statistic_type], current_stats.value)
AssertionError: 100 != None

has anyone encounter this problem?
