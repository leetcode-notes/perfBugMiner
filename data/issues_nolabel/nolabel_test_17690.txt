Add zero padding option to `tf.image.extract_glimpse`

There has been several feature request in #16663 and #2134 (comment) asking for zero padding option to tf.image.extract_glimpse.
This fix is an attempt to address the issue through:

Add an additional args of noise so that it is possible to specify uniform, gaussian, or zero.
In case zero is specified, extract_glimpse will fill padding with zeros.

Note this PR keeps the original arg uniform_noise intact (unless it conflict with noise), though it is possible to deprecate the uniform_noise if desired.
This fix fixes #16663.
