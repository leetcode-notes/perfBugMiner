Load region from `~/.aws/config` if possible in S3

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #15662 (comment) where TensorFlow does not load region from ~/.aws/config if exists. The reason was that AWS C++ SDK does not use the config file by default.
This fix adds the loading of config file (~/.aws/config) explicitly, if either AWS_REGION or S3_REGION is not available. In case none of the AWS_REGION, S3_REGION, ~/.aws/config is available, then the default use-east-1 is used (by AWS C++ SDK).
This fix is related to #15562.
