add args of TimeReversedFusedRNN

I want to use TimeReversedFusedRNN together with LSTMBlockFusedCell , but the batch_axis of LSTMBlockFusedCell's input is 1 , but not 0 . But the reverse function of TimeReversedFusedRNN can't decide which is batch_axis , just do array_ops.reverse_sequence(t, lengths, 0, 1) . So , I think it's useful that users can tell it which is batch_axis and seq_axis .
