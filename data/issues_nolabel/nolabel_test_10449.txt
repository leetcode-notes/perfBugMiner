[Feature]Adding automatic model average parallelism support in TF

Model Average is a common paradigm for distributed DL training, also there are several papers regarding to it and its variants:

Do we have any plan to bring this support into TF? Actually we have already implemented model average support and benchmarked it on several in-house models, the speed up is good, about 3X(4 cards) to 9X(16 cards) convergence speed-up. Also we are working on making the model average mechanism as automatic as possible, so modeling guys could easily leverage this nice feature.
If TF community is fine with this feature/enhancement, we will be happy to merge our code into community.
Thanks.
