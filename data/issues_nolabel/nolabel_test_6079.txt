Different Graphs on Tensorboard when running cifar10_train.py from master branch and r0.12 branch

I got different views of network graphs when running cifar10_train.py from master branch and r0.12 bracnch.
So running cifar10_train.py from r0.12 gave a complete graph in which each layer like conv1 and conv2 are connected, just like this:
cifar10_train.py graph from r0.12 branch
But running cifar10_train.py from master gave several graphs where each layer like conv1 and conv2 are not connected, just like this:
cifar10_train.py graph from master branch
I saw that cifar10_train.py from master branch used tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession, is this a bug of this class or is this just what it is expected to generate?
