ADD to CONTRIB: single_image_random_do_stereograms for data analysis

I have written a TensorFlow OP "single_image_random_dot_stereograms" which takes a 2 D array with Z values and outputs a Stereogram image for use in "encode_png/jpg".
it is based upon this paper:
http://www.learningace.com/doc/4331582/b6ab058d1e206d68ab60e4e1ead2fe6e/sirds-paper
I am sure this can be used to output data to TensorBoard as well but haven't tried that yet.
I would like to offer to add this as a contrib for TensorFlow and would like some advice if there is interest on getting the process started.  Right now I compile it into the "user_ops" section, but think it needs to move for contrib.
Basically, this helps display 3D data without hidden lines like a "waterfall" plot.
Here is the basic code as a demo:
img=[[1,2,3,3,2,1],
     [1,2,3,4,5,2],
     [1,2,3,4,5,3],
     [1,2,3,4,5,4],
     [6,5,4,4,5,5]]

session = tf.InteractiveSession()

sirds = single_image_random_dot_stereograms(img,convergence_dots_size=8,number_colors=256,normalize=True)

out = sirds.eval()

png = tf.image.encode_png(out).eval()

with open('picture_out.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(png)

The output image then looks like the attached image.  If you can view this image outside of github it will look better.  Try to look beyond the picture so the 2 dots at the bottom appear to be 3 dots.  The image should then converge and see the shape as described in "img" above.

If there is interest, I can breakup the code to better match one of the contrib subdirectories and start a pull request.
Here is a different image, inverted cone, windowed in full color.
