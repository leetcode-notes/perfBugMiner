add URLEncode for the CopyObjectRequest of S3 Rename function

I found that tf.gfile.Rename did not work for S3 objects with UTF-8 names. A "NoSuchKey" error will be reported in this case:
>>> tf.gfile.Rename('s3://xxxxxxxx/上海', 's3://xxxxxxxx/北京')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/xxxxxxxx/Software/Linux/anaconda2/envs/tfdev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/lib/io/file_io.py", line 402, in rename
    compat.as_bytes(oldname), compat.as_bytes(newname), overwrite, status)
  File "/home/xxxxxxxx/Software/Linux/anaconda2/envs/tfdev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/errors_impl.py", line 473, in __exit__
    c_api.TF_GetCode(self.status.status))
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InternalError: NoSuchKey: The specified key does not exist.

After debugging, I believed the error should be related to the usage of CopyObjectRequest. It is described that the "CopySource" must be URL-encoded (as in the AWS document ). Thus, I made a patch. It worked well in my environment, and now objects with UTF-8 names can be renamed by tf.gfile.Rename. Also, bazel test //tensorflow/core/platform/s3:s3_file_system_test passed.
Please take a look. Thanks!
