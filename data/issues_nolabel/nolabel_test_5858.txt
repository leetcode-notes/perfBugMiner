ImportError: cannot import name descriptor

I installed tensorflow from source follow tutorial and the os is macOS Sierra,tensorflow version is v0.11.0, i set up TensorFlow such that all files are linked (instead of copied) from the system directories, run the following commands inside the TensorFlow root directory:
    bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package_
    mkdir _python_build
    cd _python_build
    ln -s ../bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/org_tensorflow/* .
    ln -s ../tensorflow/tools/pip_package/* .
    python setup.py develop

when i follow the tutorial to retrain Inception's Final Layer for classifying flowers with  scripts as follows:
    “bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain“
    “bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir ~/flower_photos“

i got the same error as follows:
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/Users/jway/Documents/tensorflow/bazel-       bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.runfiles/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py", line 79, in <module>

     from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor
     ImportError: cannot import name descriptor
