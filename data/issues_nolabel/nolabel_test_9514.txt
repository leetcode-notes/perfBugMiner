Dynamic ksize and strides with MaxPool and AvgPool

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #4746 where ksize and strides is static (attr) with max_pool (and avg_pool).
This fix changes ksize and strides to input tensor with MaxPoolV2 and AvgPoolV2 so that it is dynamic now. This fix also deprecates MaxPool and AvgPool.
This fix fixes #4746.
