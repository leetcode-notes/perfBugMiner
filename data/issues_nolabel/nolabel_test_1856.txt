Incremental builds are very slow

I'm following the instructions from "Setting up TensorFlow for Development" in tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md
If I make a small change to core/kernels/eigen_spatial_convolutions.h and rebuild the pip package (bazel build --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package) the process takes 204 seconds.
