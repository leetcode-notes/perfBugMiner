Feature: log-log scale

This PR addresses #6532 and adds a toggle-able chart configuration sidebar, which should be useful for adding additional chart configuration options in the future, i.e. #1141

As it stands right now, the log scale is only applied to the x-axis when the unit is steps or relative, otherwise it ignores the configuration and uses a linear scale for wall. I'm not sure if thats the best approach and happy to make any modifications.
This is my first foray into Polymer and would appreciate any feedback :)
