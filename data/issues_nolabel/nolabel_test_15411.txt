Fix the CODEOWNERS file syntax

Note: even though this file is currently disabled, it still seems worth fixing the syntax in case it's enabled again in the future.
See https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/ for details on CODEOWNERS syntax.
In particular we should change from this pattern:
# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @octocat

to this pattern:
# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @doctocat
