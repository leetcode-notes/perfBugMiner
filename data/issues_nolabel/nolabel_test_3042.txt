Inconsistent naming of the getter functions in the C API

The naming scheme of the getter functions in the C API seems to be a bit inconsistent. For instance, there are the following declarations:
// With “Get” and without the type name.
extern TF_Code TF_GetCode(const TF_Status*);

// Without “Get” and without the type name.
extern const char* TF_Message(const TF_Status*);

// Without “Get” and with the type name (“Tensor”).
extern TF_DataType TF_TensorType(const TF_Tensor*);
The first two are even concerned with the same type, TF_Status. I’m curious if there’s any particular reason behind this naming. Thanks!
