The time cost of Tensorflow is confused

I want to improve the speed of the convolution layer. I measure the cost of two different filters.
the shape of these two filters are [1,5,3,64] and[5,5,3,64]. The computation of the latter one is five times   as much as the former one, however, the time cost are almost the same  of these two convolution layer.
conv = tf.nn.conv2d(images, kernel1, [1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
conv = tf.nn.conv2d(images, kernel2, [1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
what is the reason that the cost can not be improved?
