Building TensorFlow 1.2 from source results in catastrophic error?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 4.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1
GPU model and memory: GTX 860M
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures

Describe the problem
I have successfully installed TensorFlow 1.2 by upgrading the 1.1 version via Pip, but I wanted to install 1.2 from source to get the full benefits. However, strangely I received this error when building the pip package from bazel.

I've not seen this error before - is it because I did not git check out the 1.2 version but instead the master branch?
