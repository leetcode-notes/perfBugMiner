Two different user_ops directories

There are currently two different directories labeled user_ops, each with example(s):

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/user_ops
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/user_ops

Is this intentional or vestigial?
Might reduce confusion to merge these.
