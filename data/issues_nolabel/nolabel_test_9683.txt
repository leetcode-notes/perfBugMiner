tf.avg_pool fails for data format "NCHW" on ppc64le

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 16.04 ppc64le
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
'v1.0.1-0-ge895d5c-dirty'
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Build label: 0.4.4-2017-04-13 (@80a07b5)
CUDA/cuDNN version:
No GPU
GPU model and memory:
No GPU
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I'm trying to run tf.nn.avg_pool (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/avg_pool) by passing in NCHW as the data format on a CPU (no GPU) but see the error:
" Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: Default AvgPoolingOp only supports NHWC."
The API documentation mentions both NHWC and NCHW are supported. Please see logs below for complete details
Query: Does avg_pool support NCHW for CPUs?
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Note: Below, NHWCToNCHW defined standard func to convert from one form to another (but not shown in this snippet)



x

[  4.,   5.,   6.],

     [ 13.,  14.,  15.],
     [ 16.,  17.,  18.]]]], dtype=float32)




t = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
t = NHWCToNCHW(t)
t = tf.nn.avg_pool(t,ksize=[1,2,2,1],strides=[1,2,2,1],padding="SAME",data_format="NCHW")
actual = sess.run(t, {inputs: x})
