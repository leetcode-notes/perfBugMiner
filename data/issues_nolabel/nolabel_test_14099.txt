fix fused_batchnorm_test.py

In file fused_batchnorm_test.py,  the function _reference_training use
element_count = np.size(x) / int(np.shape(x)[0])
to get element_count for NHWC data_format, but it should be
element_count = np.size(x) / int(np.shape(x)[-1])

The last dimention is the channel number, the reason why it works now is that the test data is [2,2,6,2]
np.shape(x)[0] == np.shape(x)[-1] == 2
