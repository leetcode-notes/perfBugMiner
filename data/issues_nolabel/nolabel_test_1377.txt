Tensorflow Website : Missing Mathjax results in broken equations

The website tries to load,
https://www.tensorflow.org/MathJax/jax/output/HTML-CSS/fonts/STIX/fontdata.js?rev=2.6.1
and fails. Someone needs to fix the path to get the right version of mathjax, and have all the LaTeX symbols show up.
Thanks.
