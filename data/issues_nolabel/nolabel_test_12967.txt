Could not find `backports.weakref` while installing TensorFlow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): -
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Sierra 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): (Trying to install through package manager pip2)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0
Python version: 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce: pip2 install tensorflow==1.2.0

Describe the problem
While I try to install TF (1.2.0) on Python2.7 through the package manager Pip (pip2 install tensorflow==1.2.0) I get the following error:
Collecting tensorflow==1.2.0
  Downloading https://build.hubteam.com/pypi-mirror/packages/bf/a8/e98871dc5bfbe590ed41a38058fab1391647dc0553d5034f5fd6746f0a37/tensorflow-1.2.0-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl (33.6MB)

Requirement already satisfied: wheel in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.2.0)
Collecting backports.weakref==1.0rc1 (from tensorflow==1.2.0)
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement backports.weakref==1.0rc1 (from tensorflow==1.2.0) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for backports.weakref==1.0rc1 (from tensorflow==1.2.0)

So it doesn't find the backports.weakref package in PyPl (even if I can see it here).
Is this a known issue? What can I do to install this dependency manually?
