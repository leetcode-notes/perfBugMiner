MaxPoolingOp only supports NHWC. ERROR in my benchmark we would use NCHW dataformat

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0-rc0
Python version: 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.1
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
numactl -m 1 python ./tensorflow/models/image/convnet-benchmark-alexnet/benchmark_alexnet_MKL.py --batch_size 256 --num_batches 100 -forward_backward_only --cpu knl 2>&1|tee tensorflow_alexnet_mkl.txt

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I have compiled tensorflow with bazel 0.6.1 and install it on my xeon phi TM platform.
Meanwhile I have got a benchmark related with alexnet.
When I run the benchmark I got the error:
2017-10-12 09:38:14.503463: E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:643] Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: Default MaxPoolingOp only supports NHWC.
[[Node: pool1 = MaxPoolT=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NCHW", ksize=[1, 1, 3, 3], padding="VALID", strides=[1, 1, 2, 2], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"]]
Also I find that in the benchmark, it has take both "NCHW" and "NHWC" data format into consideration. So the benchmark should support both data format.
I couldn't figure out why,  is this error relates with out compile process, or might I need to add some other option into the compile process.
Here is my compile command:
bazel build --config=mkl --copt="-g" --copt="-DEIGEN_USE_VML" --copt="-mavx2" --copt="-mfma" --copt="-O3" --verbose_failures  --copt="-L/opt/intel/gcc/lib64" -s -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
anyone could help!
