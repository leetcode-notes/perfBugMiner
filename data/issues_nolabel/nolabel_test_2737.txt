Dynamically shaped image support for `tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad`

This patch is intended for issue #521
A new keyword argument dynamic_shape=False is added to these functions in tensorflow.python.image_ops:
crop_to_bounding_box pad_to_bounding_box resize_image_with_crop_or_pad _ImageDimensions
The change is fully backward compatible. The new functionality of resize_image_with_crop_or_pad is tested and worked well. However, the dynamic version of crop_to_bounding_box pad_to_bounding_box is missing many argument checks compared to the static version.
Keeping both a dynamic and a static version of the same function is quite ugly. Maybe we should keep only the dynamic version?
