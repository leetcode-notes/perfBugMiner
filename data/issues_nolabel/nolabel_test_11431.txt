Rank calculated incorrectly using 'gen_array_ops.rank()'

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 'v1.2.1-0-gb4957ff', '1.2.1'
Python version:  2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: No GPU
GPU model and memory: No GPU
Exact command to reproduce: //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:transpose_op_test

The problem
While running TensorFlow tests such as  //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:transpose_op_test or //tensorflow/contrib/distributions:mixture_test,
on a big endian system they fail with error: ValueError: Dimension must be 2 but is 0 for 'Mixture_1/sample/Categorical/sample/transpose' (op: 'Transpose') with input shapes: [1,4], [0].
After debugging a little, realized that, while calculating rank of a tensor in transpose method, the rank is calculated incorrectly via gen_array_ops.rank(a).
I tried replacing rank = gen_array_ops.rank(a) to use the array_ops.rank(a) method instead and it works perfectly fine.
I tried the same change on an x86 machine and it doesn't break anything there.
I am unable to understand the difference between the two methods though. Also is there some major impact of above change which is not very obvious?
