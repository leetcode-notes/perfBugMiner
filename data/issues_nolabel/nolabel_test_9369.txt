Sub-pixel shuffling tensor operation

Is there interest in integrating a subpixel shuffling operation as a core operation to Tensorflow? I've implemented such an operation on my fork and I think this could find widespread use. My implementation is a bit more generic than the one in the paper and is implemented using the C++ Tensorflow API. The operation I've defined is dimension agnostic and is found in the contrib portion of the source tree. Let me know if there is anything I need to do before making a pull request (i.e. better documentation, etc.).
