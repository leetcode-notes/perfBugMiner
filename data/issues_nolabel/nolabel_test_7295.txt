tf.get_collection to extract variables of one scope

Hi,
I have n(e.g: n=3) scopes and x (e.g: x=4) no of Variables defined in each scope.
The scopes are:
    model/generator_0
    model/generator_1
    model/generator_2

Once I compute the loss, I want to extract and provide all the variables from only one of the scope based on a criteria during run-time. Hence the index of the scope idx that I select is an argmin tensor cast into int32
    <tf.Tensor 'model/Cast:0' shape=() dtype=int32>

I have already tried:
    train_vars = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES, 'model/generator_'+tf.cast(idx, tf.string)) 

which obviously did not work.
Is there any way to get all the x Variables belonging to that particular scope using idx to pass into the optimizer.
Forgive me if this question doesnt fit into tensorflow issues.
Thanks in advance!
