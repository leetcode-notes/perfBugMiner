Binaries should target CUDA architectures 6.0, 6.1 to avoid long delays on startup

The public docker images and pip packages are not compiled against CUDA architecture 6.0 or 6.1, which can cause a delay of more than a minute during initialization when executed on corresponding hardware (P100, GTX 10 series etc.) as the CUDA driver runs JIT compilation on all of the internal kernels.
Given that the public binaries are now built against CUDA 8.0, it would make sense to have them target archs 6.0 and 6.1.
Minimal reproducer (run with CUDA_CACHE_DISABLE=1):
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
rand_init = tf.random_uniform([32, 8], -1.0, 1.0)
rand_var  = tf.Variable(rand_init)
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(init)
