Nan causes writing summary failed

I find when I try to write some weights or biases into summaries, they cannot be Nan, or it causes the program crashed. When I turn off writing summaries, everything runs normally, unless sometimes the loss could be Nan.
Is it normal that some variables (e.g. weights, biases) be Nans at sometime and the whole training process runs ok? If it is, please modify the writing summary functions to avoid crash at this situation.
Thanks!
