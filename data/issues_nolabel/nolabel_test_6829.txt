./configure: A better way to exclude fetching //tensorflow/examples/android/...

Bazel at HEAD currently breaks TF Windows build.
After bazelbuild/bazel@0b9ebfe, //tensorflow/examples/android/... has to be excluded during bazel fetch.
Using the workaround mentioned in bazelbuild/bazel#2220, so that it works on both Linux and Windows.
