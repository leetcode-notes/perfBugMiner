I used Transfer Learning to learn a set of features. So used these 3 final layers on my transfer learning task.

Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
dense_1 (Dense)              (None, 256)               6422784

dropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 256)               0

dense_2 (Dense)              (None, 2)                 514
Total params: 6,423,298
Trainable params: 6,423,298
Non-trainable params: 0

All workout on ipythonNotebook but after making it into a .pb file and loading into Android Studio. This error occurs

The same code works on those models which have input on their first layer
Example: conv2d_input_1 which was my previous task which didn't relate to transfer learning but as soon as the model changed the code didn't work. I think tensorflowAndroid wants the input layer to feed the images but our transfer learning model doesn't have the input layer to feed and is showing problem everytime
I checked the version of tensorflow and tensorflow on android and matched the version but still no luck. Could you please help me!!
