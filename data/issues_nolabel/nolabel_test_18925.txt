About newlly added eager_operation.h

In the latest Eager core update, I see that eager_operation is moved to tensorflow/core/common_runtime/eager. However this file require c_api as one of the dependency.
The c_api is suppose to be built after cpu_core_lib is generated, I am now a bit confuse as I am trying to rewrite the CMake files in order to fit the new eager structure.
Any hel?
