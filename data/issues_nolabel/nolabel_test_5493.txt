TensorBoard giving all black events and distributions

only "Starting TensorBoard 29 on port 6006" is shown
so I need to type "http://0.0.0.0:6006" myself.
Then the graph of neural network and histograms are well displayed,

Mac OS enivrement, python version 2.7.
I'm sure that the code is good because someone else runs it correctly on his Mac.
What should be the problem?
