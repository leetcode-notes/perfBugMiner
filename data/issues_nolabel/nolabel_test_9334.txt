Custom operator can't define list(type)

hi, I am writing my custom operator, need to pass a list of int tensor into it, according to https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op and https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/io_ops.cc#L59, I wrote the following code:
REGISTER_OP("MyOwnOp").Input("my_variables: dtypes").Attr("dtypes: list(int)")....
and build the code into one shared library, however error occurred when loading it through tf.load_op_library.
Here is the error message:

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Reference to attr 'dtypes' with type list(int) that isn't type or list(type) from Input("my_variables: dtypes") for Op MyOwnOp

environment:
gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04)
Python 2.7.6
tensorflow '1.0.1'
