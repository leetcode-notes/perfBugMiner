TensorFlow on Kieler Open Source und Linux Tage?

Hi,
I didn't find any contact information for the TensorFlow project, so I try it here :-)
We are organising our 15th "Kieler Open Source und Linux Tage" (northern of Germany, www.kielux.de), a conference with 4 parallel tracks with talks and workshops and a smal exhibition for open source community projects and companies.
Is there anybody who would like to hold a talk and/or give a TensorFlow workshop and/or make a booth on our event (14th - 16th September)?
Please answer by eMail to kontakt @ kilux.de .
