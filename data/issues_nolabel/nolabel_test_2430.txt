Documentation describes Python 3 Anaconda installation but no support for current Anaconda Python 3 (i.e. Python 3.5)

Anaconda uses Python 3.5 as its version of Python 3.
If you follow the instructions to install Tensorflow via Anaconda you'll fail with the error

not a supported wheel on this platform

presumably because the wheel is made for Python 3.4 instead of 3.5
