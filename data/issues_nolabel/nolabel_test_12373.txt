tf.contrib.data.Dataset behaves strangely when re-defined.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 on GCP
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip (implies binary install I think).
TensorFlow version (use command below): GIT Version: v1.2.0-5-g435cdfc, Version: 1.2.1
Python version: 2.7 and 3.5 (I checked with both)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: Run the attached script.

Describe the problem
It seems like once we start initializing and using datasets, redefining them even in minor ways leads to errors? I think? This is rather unlike any other error in python. Normally I wouldn't expect redefinitions of python variables to cause problems.
I've noticed the following:

Using separate variables for the datasets does not help (regardless of whether the old dataset is kept around or not).
Creating the datasets first and using them after does work (again regardless of whether separate variables.

If this is intended behavior, it might be worth documenting it. It's easy enough to work around I suppose. I don't know enough about TensorFlow internals to know what might be causing it.

Here's the output I get when I run the attached script:

First run works.

Third run works.
