number of class mismatch between .py file and .ckpt, which makes wrong prediction.

the total class which is assigned num_classes=1000 in the file below.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/nets/inception_v2.py
however, the published checkpoint file on the page below  for inception v2 is 1001.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim
The prediction use this check point file is wrong, even if we update num_classes=1001 in the code. the wrong prediction is not shift 1 position, but completely mess.
