Describe the problem
When using the S3 file system provider within an ECS container I am finding that even though my task has been assigned a task role that provides access to my S3 bucket it is unable to access it successfully.
Everything works fine if I supply the credentials manually using the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
After some extensive head-desking I have found that the version of aws-sdk-cpp that is used (1.0.90) appears to have been released before the ECS support was added to the sdk (aws/aws-sdk-cpp@786666d), at a minimum I think we would want 1.0.97 so that everything works as expected.
I had originally tried to bump the version but it appears that the bazel mirror has nothing but 1.0.90 available.
