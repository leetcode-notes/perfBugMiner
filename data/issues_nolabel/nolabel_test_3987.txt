About tf.contrib.slim data prepare documentation

I have spend much time to understand how to prepare my data to feed into Slim Net.
But I still can't quiet understand how to prepare my training data.
Is there a more detailed method for processing the training data, like Caffe ImageNet tutorial:http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/imagenet.html
