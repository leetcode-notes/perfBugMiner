Feature Request: Let Estimator take custom every_n_iter for LoggingTensorHook

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Amazon Deep Learning AMI
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA K80
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
Currently, tf.estimator.Estimator functions automatically log every 100 steps, from this line: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.5/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py#L760
Can there be an optional argument (something like train_loss_logging_frequency=100) passed in instead? PR here: #17117, #17157
