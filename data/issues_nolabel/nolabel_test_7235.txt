undefined symbol: clock_gettime on Ubuntu 12.04

NOTE: Only file GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests.  All other topics will be closed.
For general support from the community, see StackOverflow.
To make bugs and feature requests more easy to find and organize, we close issues that are deemed
out of scope for GitHub Issues and point people to StackOverflow.
For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more easily we will be able to offer
help and advice.
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Almost every possible workarounds and resolutions that are existing for all of the Tensorflow-related issues that have been discussed on GitHub and StackOverflow have been tried, but the issue still persists. Since, I could not find any discussions or fixes with respect to the particular issue that I am encountering, I thought reaching out to you folks would be the best option that is available, as it would help me learn from the developers themselves.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit
Python : 2.7.3 built on GCC 4.6.3
Tensorflow : 0.12.1, CPU-only version
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*): No such file or directory
Since installing from the binary pip package did not work, I tried installing Tensorflow from source, the details of which are provided below :
If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD) - b585487
The output of bazel version - 0.4.3

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.
See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#import_error
for some common reasons and solutions.  Include the entire stack trace
above this error message when asking for help.






What other attempted solutions have you tried?
The initial point of error was with respect to GLIBC_2.x not being found on my filesystem. With that I started troubleshooting and debugging Tensorflow configuration with the following list of attempted solutions -

Upgrade of GCC to v4.9
Upgrade of Bazel to v0.4.3
Upgrade of protobuf to v
Bazel installation via binary installer
Bazel installation via Git Repository clone (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel.git), followed by a hard reset to a specific HEAD
Tensorflow installation via the pip package directly using the .whl file
Tensorflow installation via Git Repository clone (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), followed by a hard reset to a specific HEAD
Bazel build with additional options such as --linkopt '-lrt' --copt '-DGPR_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE' --conlyopt='-std=c99'

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).

Execution of ./configure fetches all external dependencies successfully
During bazel build, massive number of warning messages regarding deprecation show up on the console. However, build completes successfully with building the pip package
No errors during bazel-bin execution
No errors during the .whl file execution either. Successfully installs Tensorflow 0.12.1 with most of the additional requirements like numpy, protobuf, wheel, werkzeug etc., being satisfied (the .whl file is named 'tensorflow-0.12.1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl')

I may have missed out on mentioning slight details, but I have tried my best to cover the wide range of fixes that I have been trying on. If in case, you guys have any questions for me, please feel free to reach out as those details might help you better understand the issue being described above.
Just out of curiosity as it caught my eye, I upgraded my GCC to 4.9 as was mentioned in one of the StackOverflow discussion and updated the symlinks to point to the new version. After which, I performed all of the mentioned solutions that I tried. However, I see that my Python interpreter seems to have been compiled with GCC v4.6.3. Would this be causing any kind of issues with the native runtime not being loaded?
Thank you so much for helping us out! Looking forward to hear from your end with your inputs on this.
