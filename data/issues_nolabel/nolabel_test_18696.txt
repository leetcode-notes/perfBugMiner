Describe the problem
I've run into two issues when using a warm start with the Estimator API (please let me know if you'd like me to file these as separate issues):

If checkpoints exist in the model_dir then the warm start is overridden when the session is created.
The warm start is performed on every train call, which means warm starting can't be used in the context of train_and_evaluate (or in a manual loop, unless reinitializing the Estimator).

I'd be willing (pending corporate CLA) to submit a patch if you can clarify the desired behavior. I would personally expect that:

Checkpoint restore is skipped on session creation if a warm start was performed.
The warm start settings would be cleared after the first train call. (However, if this is the desired behavior, looking longer term it seems like warm start settings shouldn't be a property of the Estimator instance.)
