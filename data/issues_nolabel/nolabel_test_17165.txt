cifar 10 can not be downloaded

Hi,
I am trying to follow the tutorial from the source code of tensor flow: /model/tutorials/cifar10/
In the cifar10.py, the link

DATA_URL = 'https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz'

does not work, I guess it is the problem from Canada.
Do you have a solution for this???
Thanks
