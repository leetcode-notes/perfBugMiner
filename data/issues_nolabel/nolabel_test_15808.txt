Remove noop python command in pyx_library rule.

It looks to me like the command produced should be:
shutil.copyfile(src.split(".")[0] + ".cpp", src.split(".")[0] + ".cpp")
based on how cpp_outs is constructed a few lines above?
Allen,  could you take a look and comment?
This file,  and the direct call to the python binary is one of the root causes of #15618
