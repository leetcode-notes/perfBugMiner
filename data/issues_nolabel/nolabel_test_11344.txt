can't find some header files when i'm using c/c++ API, eg: tensorflow/core/example/example.pb.h

TF version 1.1.0      ubuntu 14.04 ,    install by pip
In many examples about c or c++ API in tensorflow, i can find some codes like:
#include "tensorflow/core/example/example.pb.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/example/feature.pb.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb_text.h"
but in the folder where tensorflow is intalled, i can't find these file, someone knows why?
