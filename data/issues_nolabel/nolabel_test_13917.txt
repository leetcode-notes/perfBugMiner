make data file configurable(issue#13876)

Fix issue#13876.

Add fname argument to set the data file of CIFAR10 dataset.

@drpngx Please check if it is acceptable to add the flexibility in this way. If so, I'd like to update the cifar100.py, mnist.py  and so on.
@fchollet Should I make the PR in keras repo or here?
@uZeroJ Do you think whether it is necessary to add the untar argument?
