Extend Dataset API to support writing to files (not just reading)

Just as we have a pipeline to read from files and convert them to output vectors/data via some model, It would be very useful to have a pipeline to take data and write it to files.
Otherwise, we have to use TFRecordWriters and a bit more code, but really much of this can be abstracted away, simplifying the data creation process, especially when writing to shards (as one might do using distributed Tensorflow).
