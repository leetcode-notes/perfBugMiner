Remove calculation of unnecessary matrix columns in SVD gradient

The SVD gradient calculation when compute_uv=False currently uses the orthogonal "U" and "V" matrices returned by the SVD operation with full_matrices=True, but it really requires only the full_matrices=False versions.  This pull request makes the calculation use the full_matrices=False versions.
@rmlarsen pointed out that this change could be made in #14259 (comment).
