Problem w/ leaky_relu

Describe the problem
Having problems using tf.nn.leaky_relu.  Attempted to deal with the problem by trying out tf.nn.elu and tf.nn.relu, but both functions resulted in a fairly significant drop in accuracy.  I was originally building the model in Keras, but switched to TensorFlow after having a problem with the corresponding leaky_relu function in Keras.  The TensorFlow and Keras source code and error logs are below.  Thank you in advance!

def conv2d_w_leakyrelu(x, W, b, s = 1, name = "conlayer_i"): 
    x = tf.nn.conv2d(input = x, filter = W, strides = [1, s, s, 1], data_format = "NHWC", padding = "SAME", name = name)
    x = tf.nn.bias_add(value = x, bias = b)
    # return tf.nn.elu(features = x) # TENSORFLOW PROBLEMS WITH LEAKY_RELU, SO USING ELU ACTIVATION FOR NOW
    return tf.nn.leaky_relu(features = x, alpha = lr_alpha)

Keras Source Code
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size = (im_h, im_w), strides = (s, s), padding = "same", kernel_initializer = KI, input_shape = input_shape))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha = leakiness))
