Bug: tf.app.run() does not allow to import ipdb

When using tensorflow with tf.app.run() one cannot import ipdb. I have tested several Tensorflow Versions and did run Tensorflow in several environments, all of them seems to be affected by this Bug.
The following script provides a minimal Example reproducing the error:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import ipdb
import tensorflow as tf


def main(_):
    """Run main function."""
    print("Hello World.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    tf.app.run()

Executing the  script yields the following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tensorapp.py", line 14, in <module>
    tf.app.run()
  File "/home/marvin/.virtualenvs/tensorvision/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py", line 29, in run
    main = main or sys.modules['__main__'].main
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'main'

If you suspect this is an IPython bug, please report it at:
    https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues
or send an email to the mailing list at ipython-dev@scipy.org

You can print a more detailed traceback right now with "%tb", or use "%debug"
to interactively debug it.

Extra-detailed tracebacks for bug-reporting purposes can be enabled via:
