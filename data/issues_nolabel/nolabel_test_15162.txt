tf.data.Dataset.from_generator creates too many threads throwing "thread constructor failed"

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):Adapted an example from documentation
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Mac OS Siera (10.12.6)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow-1.4.0-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce:

import itertools
import tensorflow as tf

def gen():
  for i in itertools.count(1):
    yield (i, [1] * 5)

ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    gen, (tf.int64, tf.int64), (tf.TensorShape([]), tf.TensorShape([None])))
ds = ds.make_one_shot_iterator()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    while True:
        sess.run(ds.get_next())  # (1, array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]))...

Describe the problem
If you run the code above, which is adapted from tf.data.Dataset.from_generator docstring, the program will crash with an error: libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: thread constructor failed: Resource temporarily unavailable.
I see the number of threads increasing in the activity monitor of the mac OS and when it reaches ~3K threads the program crashes. It takes several seconds.
Please let me know if this is not intended use of this API, it is OS releated issue or there is a bug involved.
