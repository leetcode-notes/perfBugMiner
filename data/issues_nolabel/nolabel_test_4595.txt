Rename TF_Attr_Type and TF_Attr_Metadata

The names of the TF_Attr_Type enum and TF_Attr_Metadata struct seem to be unlike any other names in the C API. Contrast them with TF_OperationDescription, TF_SessionOptions, TF_SessionWithGraph, and TF_DataType, which are also composed of multiple words. Since 0.11 hasn’t been released yet, perhaps it’s not too late to unify the naming scheme.
