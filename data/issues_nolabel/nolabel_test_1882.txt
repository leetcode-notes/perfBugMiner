Distortions in Retrain.py (Transfer learning w/ inception model) take exceedingly long

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
CUDA: 7.5
cuDNN: 6.5 (v2)
Using nVidia Quadro K2200

Steps to reproduce
Retrain.py runs fine without any distortions. Not massively faster than CPU, but faster.
NVIDIA-SMI shows that the GPU has 3824mb used during training.
If any distortions are used, training becomes very, very, long. It takes almost ten minutes for ten images to be trained.
Is this very slow speed intended?
