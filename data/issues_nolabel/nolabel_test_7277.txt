Improve docs for incompatible protobuf error

On Mac OS X, importing tensorflow can result in the error: "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'syntax'". As explained in the doc, this is caused by an incompatible protobuf version. The suggested fix, "pip install --upgrade protobuf", doesn't resolve the issue if the user has installed protobuf via Homebrew. This commit adds an example command to fix the error in this case.
