Windows GPU random initialization not working

Using tf.truncated_normal (and possibly the other random functions too) on my GPU (GTX 1060) with the new Windows build produces only zeros whereas running it on my CPU works as expected.
Example code:
with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # Something random, as expected
        print("CPU:", sess.run(tf.truncated_normal([5])))

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # All zeros
        print("GPU:", sess.run(tf.truncated_normal([5])))
I used the same setup as here with CMake 3.6 and rolled back to 41ba1e0 to fix the issue with eigen not compiling.
// Also it seems the result of any calculation involving a tf.Variable becomes 0, while just running / printing the variable itself shows its correct value (CPU works fine though).
