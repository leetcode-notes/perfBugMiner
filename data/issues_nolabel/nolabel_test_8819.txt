Does tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() support GRPC?

I am not sure if the feature for MonitoredTrainingSession() working with grpc is existing or not. If not, can we have a feature request here? I also posted details on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43103763/does-tf-train-monitoredtrainingsession-support-grpc. Thanks!
