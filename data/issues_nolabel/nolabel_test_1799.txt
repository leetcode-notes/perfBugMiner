One hot embedding?

I'd like to embed integer labels into a fixed dimension space via the classic one-hot embedding. Here is an example:
onehot(inputs=[0, 2], num_labels=4) -> [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]

It seems that sparse_to_dense does something similar, but not quite what I want. I've found some solutions online but they are rather convoluted. Is there a straightforward way to do this in tensorflow?
