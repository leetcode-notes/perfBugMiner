Cannot import name 'pywrap_tensorflow'

Hi, I have tried almost every methods in Stackoverflow and here, but am still struggling with the problem. Please help me to solve it.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 64bit (GTX 1070)
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 8.0 RC & cuDNN 5.0
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
dongyoung@dkpc:~$ ls /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcud*
/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudadevrt.a    /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.8.0.27  /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.5
/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so      /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart_static.a   /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.5.0.5
/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.8.0  /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so          /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn_static.a
If installed from binary pip package, provide

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
Sorry, but I don't know how to do this. I just downloaded the tensorflow-master.zip file from Github
The output of bazel version
[bazel release 0.3.0]

Steps to reproduce

In my home directory, type 'ipython3', then change directory to tensorflow that I installed which is ~/tensorflow
then type 'import tensorflow as tf'
It shows ImportError: cannot import name 'pywrap_tensorflow'

Logs or other output that would be helpful

(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
One more question is that how can I make a path 'tensorflow' to use globally?
Thank you :)
