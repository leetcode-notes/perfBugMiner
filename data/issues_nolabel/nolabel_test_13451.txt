Add support for CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH in fp16 GEMM

Applies to matrix multiplications with fp16 input/output.
Computations will fall back to pseudo-fp16 if tensor op math is
disabled or not supported.
Enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting the environment
variable TF_DISABLE_TENSOR_OP_MATH=1.
