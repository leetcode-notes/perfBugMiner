How to make full use of multicore(only cpu mode) on android phone?

System information
Platform : android 6.0, arm64-v8a
TensorFlow installed from source(cpu mode only):
TensorFlow version (1.2.0)
Bazel version (0.5.2)
Describe the problem
When I trained a model by using google object-detection api, I put it to my android env, and use c++ api to run the pb file model on my phone, it has a slow running speed, and only 2 cpus are fully utilized when there are 8 cpus on my device. What should I do to make full use of the remaining cpus on my mobile phone?
I use c++ api to run the model, here is my config to session of tensorflow, but it is useless.Could some one help me?
Source code / logs
tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
tensorflow::ConfigProto &config = options.config;
config.mutable_device_count()->insert(google::protobuf::MapPair<std::string, google::protobuf::int32>("cpu",8));
config.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads(8);
