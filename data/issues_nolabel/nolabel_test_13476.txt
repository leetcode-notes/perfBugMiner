`tf.rnn.contrib` ops missing in Java API

I am trying to run an LSTM built with the Python API, exported to to protobuf, and evaluated in Java. After I updated my python scripts to use tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockCell, LSTMBlockFusedCell, etc cell implementations, the Java portion stopped working and started throwing:
org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'BlockLSTM' in binary running on xubuntu. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.

and
org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'LSTMBlockCell' in binary running on xubuntu. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.

Evaluating the graph in Python works swimmingly. I didn't see anything on stack overflow. There are a couple tickets on github which might be related: #11847 and #12566
TF Version (Java and python): 1.3.0
Python Version: 2.7
