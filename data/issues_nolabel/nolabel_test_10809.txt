New changes in tf 1.2 and the seq2seq model

In the change log it reads: "The strictness described
in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone: The first time an RNNCell is used,
it caches its scope. All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from
that same scope."
Based on which the seq2seq model (with UNtied decoder weights) no longer remain untied. Can you confirm that this is addressed? I don't see anywhere in the seq2seq model that this is addressed.
