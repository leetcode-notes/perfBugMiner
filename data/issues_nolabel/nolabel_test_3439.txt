"tensorflow: Input iterator is exhausted" when passing numpy arrays in validation monitor

I'm not sure if this is a bug or whether I just don't understand the usage of monitors (in which case I apologize for posting here). I'm trying to use a validation monitor by passing my validation set as numpy array.
val_monitor = learn.monitors.ValidationMonitor(X_val, Y_val, every_n_steps=100)
reg.fit(X_train, Y_train, steps=1000, batch_size=200, monitors=[val_monitor])

(X_val and Y_val are numpy arrays)
The code runs but only the first validation step is done properly, then I get the following message in the logs:
INFO:tensorflow:Input iterator is exhausted.
Any help is welcome!
