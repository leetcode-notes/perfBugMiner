Trying to import google.cloud
python -c "from google.cloud import logging as gclogging;"

results in the following error
ImportError: No module named cloud

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Whenever I install google protobuf using either of the following commands
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-py2-none-any.whl
# OR
pip install dist/<wheel file name>

I can no longer import google.cloud.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
I'm aware of the fact that you can build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support comes with integration when running  ./configure. Howoever it's not clear how to integrate with Google Stackdriver.
