Java API Generics Phase 3.

Added the utility Tensors class.
Updated tests to use it.
Updated scripts for generating Tensors.java and the types directory.
Note that these are still run manually, but remain helpful because
maintaining so many methods and their documentation is a headache.
Added missing checking for attempts to create tensors from arrays of boxed
primitives, and a test case.
