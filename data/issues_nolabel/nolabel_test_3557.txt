What would be required to submit an implementation of the Hungarian algorithm to tf.contrib

@Russell91 and I have an interest in contributing an implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, perhaps based off of the implementation he has here.
What do we need to do to make this happen? Is there a document covering this somewhere (besides the one that says we need to sign the CLA).
