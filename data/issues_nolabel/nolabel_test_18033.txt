Fixed the bug in mkl_input_conversion

This PR fixed the failed unit test //tensorflow/python:image_ops_test  for MKL configuration.
mkl_input_conversion operator compares the shapes of two inputs to decide the input tensors need be converted to TensorFlow format or not. In the bug I saw in TFDO-251, two input tensors are both in MKL format, their total number of elements are the same, but some dimensions are different, for example, one dimension is [2][1][15][3], and another one is [1][2][15][3]. However, the following code to compare the shape is actually comparing MKL shape, not the original TensorFlow shape:
bool tf_shapes_are_same = context->input(0).shape() == context->input(1).shape();
I changed it to compare the original TensorFlow shape.
This PR also includes some code cleanup.
