Update docs of reduce_max/reduce_min for real numeric type

Both reduce_max and reduce_min only work for real numeric types as complex numbers do not apply. This fix update the docs with numeric type -> real numeric type.
Note that the current kernel registration in reduction_ops_max.cc and reduction_ops_min.cc
use TF_CALL_REAL_NUMBER_TYPES so no change needed. The op registraton for Max and Min inside math_ops.cc should be .Attr("T: realnumbertype") instead of numbertype. However, such a change will break API compatibility so leave it alone.
