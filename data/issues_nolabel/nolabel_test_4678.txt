dynamic_raw_rnn

Working example of the recent raw_rnn by @ebrevdo .
This working example implements the dynamic_rnn without tuple support (yet) using the raw_rnn interface.
The working example builds on this snippet, but is fully functional and provides the same interface as dynamic_rnn using the raw_rnn implementation.
The purpose is not to replace dynamic_rnn (at least not yet?), but to give a code base with commentaries for implementing custom RNNs using the raw_rnn interface.
