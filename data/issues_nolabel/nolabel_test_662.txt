optimize slice_input_producer

When shuffle=False, input_slice_producer can be implemented directly with FIFOQueue.
The original implementation using range and array indexing is slower.
I could pass the unit test input_test.py. But please correct me if I could use the name and set_shape in a better way (i'm not totally sure).
I simply run it on my old laptop on CPU and I saw input_slice_producer + batch operations (which is a no-op) introduces no overhead, while with the original implementation I see obvious overhead.
