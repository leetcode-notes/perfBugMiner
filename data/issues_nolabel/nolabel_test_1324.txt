GLIBC error

I searched for this issue but did not find any useful way. I installed tensorflow with pip and I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and python 2.7.3.
When in python I write import tensorflow, it raises the following error:
ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so)
Any useful suggestion?
Thanks
