Make plugin_data optional instead of repeated

This patches tensorflow/tensorflow#11952 into master. Here is that PR's description:
Every summary op writes data for a single plugin to process. Hence, each
SummaryMetadata proto should have a single PluginData optional field
(instead of a repeated one). This removes much complexity from
TensorBoard logic that loops over the plugin data. It also simplifies
the SQL schema - it can now enforce a one-to-one relationship between
summary op and plugin.
