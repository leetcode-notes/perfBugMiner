Could not resolve github.com

I am trying for tensorflow for poets and while doing the following in docker image
cd /tensorflow
git pull
error:
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com
attempted solutions
followed the issue discussion https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker/issues/68
After editing /etc/default/docker, uncommenting the DOCKER_OPTS line makes no difference.
