Protobuf Compilation /object_detection/protos/anchor_generator_pb2.py: Permission denied issue

I need to implement object detection using Tensorflow but.
Im getting ,
Protobuf Compilation /object_detection/protos/anchor_generator_pb2.py: Permission denied issue when executing
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.  in Protobuf Compilation
this is the issue i already having.

Here is my link for Tensorflow model https://github.com/tensorflow/models
and i used Protocol Buffers v3.4.0
So, can anyone knows how to solve and execute that command?ï»¿
