Interleaving multiple datasets together

@mrry The current interleave functionality is basically a interleaved flat-map taking as input a single dataset. Given the current API, what's the best way to interleave multiple datasets together? Say they have already been constructed and I have a list of them. I want to produce elements from them alternatively and I want to support lists with more than 2 datasets (i.e., stacked zips and interleaves would be pretty ugly).
Thanks! :)
