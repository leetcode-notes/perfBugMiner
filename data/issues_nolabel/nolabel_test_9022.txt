Softmax Regressions: Please don't talk about probabilities

This tutorial talks about probabilities on softmax regression. This is a common mistake. A classifier talks about its confidence, but it is not a real probability of some kind of distribution. Please don't teach something wrong, only to make it some kind of simple.
Confidence is simple enough.
