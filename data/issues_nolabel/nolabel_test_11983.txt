Remove tfserve page which is soon to be outdated.

We are in the process of serving tfserve documentation in a different way, so this file needs to be removed.  1.2 is the current "root" branch on tensorflow.org, so we need to cut it from r1.2, and we were not able to cherrypick the change back from master (where it is already gone).
