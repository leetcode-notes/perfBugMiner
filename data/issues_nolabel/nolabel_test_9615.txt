Added options for linking to libraries that are present on system

Added options for linking dynamically to libraries that are present on local system, instead of downloading them (such as libpng, libjpeg, zlib, ...).
This reduces the file size of the shared library libtensorflow.so and adds some security since the libraries such as libpng, libjpeg may be updated independently, without having to rebuild them as part of a tensorflow build from source.
