Add `colors` support for `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #15692 where it was not possible to specify the colors for boxes in tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes. Instead, a predefined fixed color table was used to cycle through colors.
This fix adds colors Input to DrawBoundingBoxexV2 so that it is possible to specify the color. In case no color is specified, the default color table will be used.
Since there is an API change, the op is labeled as V2.
This fix fixes #15692.
