`tf.device()` issue

I posted my issue about In-graph replication for Distributed Tensorflow on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43036201/in-graph-replication-for-distributed-tensorflow. I wonder if there is a bug in terms of tf.device(), as I expect each process has its own log instead of print out message that belongs to other block of tf.device() like my example there. Thanks!
