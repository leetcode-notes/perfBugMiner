Running Tensorflow on GeForce 940M (Ubuntu 14)

Hi everyone,
I'm running the CIFAR-10 classification from the Tensorflow for the very first time on my laptop with GeForce 940M. I'm running the training with the pre-defined parameters as follows:
python cifar10_train.py
after step 1800 I'm getting the following errors:
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_event.cc:33] Error polling for event status: failed to query event: CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1182] failed to enqueue async memcpy from device to host: CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS; host dst: 0x7ff8e9bf26c0; GPU src: 0x5011c0600; size: 16=0x10 F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_event_mgr.cc:105] Unexpected Event status: 1 I tensorflow/stream_executor/stream.cc:3304] stream 0x35e7190 did not block host until done; was already in an error state Aborted (core dumped)
Does anybody have any idea?
By the way, the following fix was required on my side to get the training running:
from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile gfile.Exists(...)
without "ts." in front, it didn't work that way... Any ideas why? I've just forked the repository without any changes.
Thanks a lot in advance for your help! Any advice is kindly appreciated!
