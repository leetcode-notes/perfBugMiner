memory leak with tf.image.encode_jpeg

I encountered an issue with tf.image.encode_jpeg. I got a lot of images to preprocess. The code that caused the problem is like this:
for imagefile in image_list:
im = cv2.imread(imagefile)
image_data = tf.image.encode_jpeg(im, format='rgb')
The memory usage kept increasing as image.encode_jpeg was called. Eventually the 256G mem server ran out of memory.
