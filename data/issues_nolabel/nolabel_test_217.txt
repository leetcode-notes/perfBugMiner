Is pep8 compatibility necessary right now for tensorflow?

On running the pep8 test, I found out around 18k warnings. I think we should strict to some guideline, so that as the project grows, a proper standard is maintained. We can use flake8 for this.
I can work on this and submit a PR, if pep8 compatibility is required.
