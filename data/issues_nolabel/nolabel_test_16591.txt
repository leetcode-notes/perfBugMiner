Fix FutureWarning on issubdtype from float to np.floating

This is try to fix #16587.
FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated

Before fix:
>>> np.issubdtype(np.integer, np.float)
__main__:1: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.
False

After fix:
>>> np.issubdtype(np.integer, np.floating)
False
>>>
