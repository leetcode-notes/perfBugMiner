Fix the inconsistency in the accepted shape/data_format in layers doc

This PR is to fix #17892 on the the inconsistency in the accepted shape/data_format of layers doc.
As described in the above issue, the Tensorflow Layers Guide at specifies:

The methods in the layers module for creating convolutional and pooling layers for two-dimensional image data expect input tensors to have a shape of [batch_size, image_width, image_height, channels]

While, the inline documentation specified for conv2D mentions the following valid data_formats:

data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first.
The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape
(batch, height, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to
inputs with shape (batch, channels, height, width)

Moreover, nn.bias_add, avg_pool2d etc.  also accept [...,height, width...] but using different strings/methodology.

inputs: A 4-D tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, channels] if
data_format is NHWC, and [batch_size, channels, height, width] if
data_format is NCHW.
