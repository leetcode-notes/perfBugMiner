Markdown links using `[This link](http://example.net/)` syntax

Noticed these spots are using a syntax similar to markdown links but weren't rendering in the markdown under g3doc.
There may be a valid reason these links are different, they do cross new line boundaries but there are other links which do as well and use [This link](http://example.net/) syntax.
