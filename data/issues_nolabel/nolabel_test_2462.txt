Why is there no support for directly computing cross entropy?

I see that we have methods for computing softmax and sigmoid cross entropy, which involve taking the softmax or sigmoid of the logit vector and then computing cross entropy with the target, and the weighted and sparse implementations of these. But what if I simply want to compute the cross entropy between 2 vectors?
