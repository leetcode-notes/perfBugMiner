Docs(Queue): Fix a PriorityQueue API missing bug

As we all know there are 4 subclass of class QueueBase, but only 3 subclass(FIFOQueue, PaddingFIFOQueue, RandomShuffleQueue) descriptions in the API Docs here
So I add the description of  class PriorityQueue() which are the comments in ../python/ops/data_flow_ops.py.
Start line 714 to 759 and you can check here
