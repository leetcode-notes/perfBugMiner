Show usage when no arguments passed to import_pb_to_tensorboard.py

It seems like --model_dir and --log_dir should be required arguments.  After adding at least one required argument, then parseargs handles no arguments cleanly.
TESTING
Running it before the fix:
$ python import_pb_to_tensorboard.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "import_pb_to_tensorboard.py", line 74, in <module>
    app.run(main=main, argv=[sys.argv[0]] + unparsed)
TypeError: run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'argv'

Running it after the fix:
$ python import_pb_to_tensorboard.py 
usage: import_pb_to_tensorboard.py [-h] --model_dir MODEL_DIR --log_dir
                                   LOG_DIR
import_pb_to_tensorboard.py: error: argument --model_dir is required

I was unable to test the success path due to this issue: #11519
Testing done on Mac OSX Sierra 10.12.5 using Python 2.7.6.
ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION
Let me know if you prefer that no arguments are required.  If that is the case, I was considering this solution (from this Stackoverflow answer):
  try:
    app.run(main=main, argv=[sys.argv[0]] + unparsed)
  except:
    # Print the usage if the user provides no arguments
    parser.print_help()
    sys.exit(0)

OTHER THOUGHTS
It seems like model_dir should maybe be renamed to model_path (assuming that it should link the file, not the directory which it is in)?
