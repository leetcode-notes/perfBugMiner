Indentation is wrong
The example code snippets from the bottom of chapter PROGRAMMERS' GUIDE / Variables:
with tf.variable_scope("model") as scope:
  output1 = my_image_filter(input1)
with tf.variable_scope(scope, reuse=True):
  output2 = my_image_filter(input2)

should be:
with tf.variable_scope("model") as scope:
  output1 = my_image_filter(input1)
  with tf.variable_scope(scope, reuse=True):
    output2 = my_image_filter(input2)
