in_top_k op does not work with int64 labels

The tf.nn.in_top_k op does not work with int64 labels. This is problematic when computing accuracy from a one-hot encoding of labels as the output of argmax is int64:
y = tf.placeholder("float")
yhat = tf.placeholder("float")
tf.nn.in_top_k(yhat, tf.argmax(y, 1), 1)
yields the error:
TypeError: Input 'targets' of 'InTopK' Op has type int64 that does not match expected type of int32.

The simple workaround is to cast the labels before calling the op:
tf.nn.in_top_k(y, tf.cast(tf.argmax(y_, 1), "int32"), 1)

but it'd be nice if int64 labels were supported out of the box.
