Steps to reproduce


Run inception model on training with inception_train.py
bazel-bin/inception/(pick your data)_train 
--train_dir="${TRAIN_DIR}" 
--data_dir="${DATA_DIR}" 
--pretrained_model_checkpoint_path="${PRETRAINED_DIR}" 
--fine_tune=True 
--initial_learning_rate=0.01 
--input_queue_memory_factor=12 
--batch_size=64 
--max_steps=100000 
--num_epochs_per_decay=30 
--num_preprocess_threads=4 
--num_readers=4 
--log_device_placement=True


What have you tried?

This is ironic, because I have been wrestling with the problem for a few days, and serendipitously came to a conclusion. I was training the model and testing it out, and always
after 1000~ steps the training slows to a crawl utilizing my GPU only every 10s - 15s and the CPU seems to be only utilizing 2 threads to 100% at this point for preprocessing , when i specified 4 & 4 readers, but all threads kick in right before/at the GPU utilization. I tried restarted and playing with the threads and readers and other things, no luck, it still slowed after 1000~ steps. I left it running for whatever reason and later started running a Tensorflow bazel build, which used significant CPU for some time and after/during the build my training magically picked up to the original speed at the beginning, and by picked up i mean went from 1-4 exp/s not steady to 15 exp/s steady, hmm thats strange, because it had been crawling for hours at 1-4 exp/s?
