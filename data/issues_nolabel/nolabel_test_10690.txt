Fix the f16 implementation of Literal and LiteralUtil

Adjust the implementation of Literal to do the right thing for F16.   The new Literal class is nice, in that it is just a std::vector of half types, which is nice and simple.
The Proto version still has to have a bit of munging around due to protobuf limitations.
