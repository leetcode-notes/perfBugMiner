Fix shape inference for bitwise ops with broadcasting

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #14646 where shape inference for bitwise ops is incorrect with broadcasting.
As was specified in #14646, in the following
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> tf.bitwise.bitwise_and(tf.zeros([3,1], dtype=tf.int32), tf.zeros([1,3], dtype=tf.int32))
<tf.Tensor 'BitwiseAnd:0' shape=(3, 1) dtype=int32>

the result shape should be (3, 3), not (3, 1).
This fix fixes the issue by changing
.SetShapeFn(shape_inference::UnchangedShape)
to
.SetShapeFn(shape_inference::BroadcastBinaryOpShapeFn)
Additional test cases have been added.
This fix fixes #14646.
