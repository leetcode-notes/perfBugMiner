Describe the problem
I have started working on TensorFlow master. The build passed successfully , however the test command is failing with below error  -
ERROR: /tensorflow/third_party/mkl/BUILD:45:12: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration (would a default condition help?).

Looks like need some code changes to fix this on ppc64le, I have started my analysis. Please provide if any suggestions.Thanks!
