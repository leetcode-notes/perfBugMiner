Use .bazelrc to configure optional dependencies

Rather than having ./configure mutate one of our .bzl files, which dirties the git repository, this change has ./configure put --define options in .bazelrc for jemalloc, GCS, HDFS, and XLA inside a .bazelrc at the root of the TensorFlow repository. This file is listed in .gitignore.
Therefore, running ./configure will no longer cause the git repository to be in a modified state.
Fixes #8202
