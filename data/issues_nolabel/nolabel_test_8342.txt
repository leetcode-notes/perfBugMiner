[TensorBoard] load data from relative path with the projector plugin

This is a  problem similar with issue #7382 but it has been closed.

Another place that still has the similar problem in #7382 is the request of project plugin data in Embeddings panel, e.g.  /data/plugin/projector/runs still requests in a absolute path.
I found the code  here , there is a leading slash for the route-prefix property in vz-projector-dashboard.
If that is correct, I will submit a PR. Thanks!
Another question is when will the tensorboard be recompiled. As now in version 1.0 these features are not included.
