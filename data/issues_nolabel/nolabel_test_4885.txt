After some iterations my accuracy has decrease to 0, but the loss and cross entropy are not nan.

Hello
I can't understand this question:
I can trained my net in a correct result in beginning but after about 4K iterations ,the accuracy suddenly decrease to zero, and the loss and cross entropy suddenly increased to a high value, it is like this curves:
train accuracy:

val accuracy:

cross entropy:

regular loss:

I think you can reproduce it in this link(3D Convolution, UCF101):
