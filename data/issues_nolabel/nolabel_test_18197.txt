Fix std::out_of_range error when tensorrt.create_inference_graph

Error
when invoke trt.create_inference_graph(g,["detection_boxes:0"])
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::substr
Aborted (core dumped)

Error is from ParseTensorName() function, string name has been replaced as the substring, so the index of column is out ranged.
