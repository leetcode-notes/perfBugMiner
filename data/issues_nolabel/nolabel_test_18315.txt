with keepdims. This casues the following WARNING in BatchNormalization:
normalization.py:584: calling reduce_mean (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) with keep_dims is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
keep_dims is deprecated, use keepdims instead

This fix fixes the warning in BatchNormalization.
