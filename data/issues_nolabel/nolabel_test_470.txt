Tensorboard does not support Python 3

tensorboard.py and tensorboard_handler.py are still using BaseHTTPServer which was move to http.server in Python 3. There are some other changes with StringIO and urlparse that were quickly resolved with 2to3.
Strings also need to be encoded for the wfile.writes in tensorboard_handler.py.
Everything seemed to work after I made these changes.
