Add custom operator code generator script

This script uses jinja2 templates to generate the following:

C++ Header file that defines the operator class, templated on Device.
C++ Header file that defines the CPU implementation of the operator.
C++ Source file with Shape Function, REGISTER_OP and  REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER constructs.
Cuda Header that defines the GPU implementation of the operator,  including a CUDA kernel.
Cuda Source file with GPU REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER's for the operator.
python unit test case, which constructs random input data, and calls   the operator.
Makefile for compiling the operator into a shared library, using g++   and nvcc.

Operator inputs, outputs, polymorphic type attributes, other attributes and documentation can be specified.
