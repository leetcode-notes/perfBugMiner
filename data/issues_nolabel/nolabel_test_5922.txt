the sample code "translate.py" does not train a correct model

After v0.10, the seq2seq sample code, translate.py, although runnable, but does not give correct output.
I trained a default model using downloaded EN->FR data set, the trained system cannot even translate basic words like: I, you, he and she.
Does someone know why?
Below are my system info:

Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
