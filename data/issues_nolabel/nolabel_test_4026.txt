TensorFlow SKFlow Estimators Fail when Using read_batch_examples

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu
Package: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Version: 0.10.0rc0
I'm currently trying to use tf.contrib.learn.read_batch_examples working while using a TensorFlow (SKFlow/tf.contrib) Estimator, specifically the LinearClassifier. I create a read_batch_examples op feeding in a CSV file with a tf.decode_csv for the parse_fn parameter with appropriate default records. I then feed that op to my input_fn for fitting the Estimator, but when that's run I receive the following error:
Error Message
ValueError: Tensor("centered_bias_weight:0", shape=(1,), dtype=float32_ref) must be from the same graph as Tensor("linear/linear/BiasAdd:0", shape=(?, 1), dtype=float32).

What I've Tried
The code works if I run the op beforehand and then feed the input instead as an array of values. While this workaround exists, it is unhelpful because I am working with large datasets in which I need to batch in my inputs. Currently going over Estimator.fit (currently equivalent to Estimator.partial_fit in iterations isn't nearly as fast as being able to feed in data as it trains, so having this working is ideal.  Additionally I've tried wrapping everything with with tf.Graph().asdefault(). Any ideas? The non-functioning code is below.

Any alternatives for batching would be appreciated as well!
