relatively slower performance on FCN

according to the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07249,
TensorFlow is good at CNN and RNN, however relatively slower on FCN, is this because of using python loop to feed data each mini-batch? Can we solve this since FCN is always important in general use of Deep Learning like competitions in kaggle.
