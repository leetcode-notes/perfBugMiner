Unable to run "bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain"

Hi! I was going through the re-trainer tutorial but i keep encountering the following error.
Executing genrule //tensorflow/core:version_info_gen failed: bash failed: error executing command /bin/bash -c ... (remaining 1 argument(s) skipped): com.google.devtools.build.lib.shell.BadExitStatusException: Process exited with status 1.
