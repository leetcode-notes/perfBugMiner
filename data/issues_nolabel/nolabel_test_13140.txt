[GDR] Eliminate several unnecessary sync barriers

Following the plan I mentioned in #12361 (comment), I have refactored out the sync wrapper around copy between CPU and GPU.
Now the user need to supply a StatusCallback when calling RemoteMemoryManager:: TransportOptionsFromTensor and RemoteMemoryManager::TensorFromTransportOptions, in order to prepare for the potential CPU-GPU tensor transfer.
