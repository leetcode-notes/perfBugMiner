Add `int64` out_idx` support for `listdiff`/`list_diff`/`setdiff1d`

This fix tries to add int64 out_idx support for listdiff/list_diff/setdiff1d.
As was specified in docs (tf.setdiff1d.__doc__), it is possible to specify tf.int32 or tf.int64 for the type of the output idx. However, the tf.int64 kernel has not been registered. As a consequence, an error will be thrown out if tf.int64 is used.
This fix adds int64 out_idxsupport forlistdiff/list_diff/setdiff1d`. Related test cases have been updated as well.
