Fix dynamic_stitch gradient implementation

This modifies the gradient calculation for the dynamic_stitch op so that it gives the correct gradient when the input indices have duplicate values (issue is described in more detail in #7397).
I also expanded the unit tests so that the gradient calculation is tested with a wider range of inputs (since it is now more complicated/error-prone), and added a test specifically for the duplicate indices case.
