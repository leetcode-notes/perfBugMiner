question about LSTM cell state size

hi everyone:
with the config as below for a BasicLSTM cell:
   init_scale = 0.05
learning_rate = 0.01
max_grad_norm = 5
num_layers = 2
num_steps = 10
hidden_size = 200
keep_prob = 0.5
lr_decay = 0.8
batch_size = 30  

I use 2-hidden layers model:
lstm_cell = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(hidden_size, forget_bias=0.0)
cell = rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell] * 2)
Then: What is the cell.state_size?
I got it as 30 x 800, but I can't understand how it come to?
