Placeholders should have a feeding schedule in TensorFlow?

I have a parameter which should set at the beginning of each epoch and it is constant during the epoch's execution. Currently, we defined a placeholder for this param and during the training I have to pass the same value in each iteration:
sess.run(train_op, feed_dict={param: const_param})
It's a bit inefficient since pass the same value at each step of the same epoch. Is it possible to define a placeholder and feed it once just at the beginning of each epoch?
This feature is available in tf.data when set the tfrecords file at the beginning and fetch data iteratively.
