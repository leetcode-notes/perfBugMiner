The code in google_auth_provider.cc looks for application default credentials in an obsolete location.

Exact command to reproduce:

gcloud auth activate-service-account --file ${CREDENTIALS_FILE}
ls ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
Describe the problem
This is a bug where the code for reading Google credentials written by the gcloud tool no longer matches the behavior of the gcloud tool (the tool changed its behavior since this code was written).
Specifically, the code here tries to read credentials written by gcloud to a well-known location of "~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json".
However, gcloud does not write credentials to that location anymore.
Moreover, the Cloud SDK (of which gcloud is one component) provides no guarantees about the stability of where/how it stores credentials.
Instead, tools using these credentials are expected to use the gcloud tool to produce them by running:
gcloud config config-helper --format "value(credential)"
