Steps to reproduce
I have trained a convolutional model through the main program and stored it into a checkpoint and ckpt file. The problem lies in the evaluation program. The ckpt file seems to not output anything but a bunch of errors. The program does not complete either.
The code for main is:
import Input
import Process

import time
import numpy as np

import tensorflow as tf
from datetime import datetime

FLAGS = tf.app.flags.FLAGS

def train():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        images, labels = Process.inputs()

        forward_propgation_results = Process.forward_propagation(images)

        train_loss, cost = Process.error(forward_propgation_results, labels)

        image_summary_t = tf.image_summary(images.name, images, max_images = 2)

        summary_op = tf.merge_all_summaries()

        init = tf.initialize_all_variables()

        saver = tf.train.Saver()

        sess.run(init)

        saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.all_variables())

        tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess = sess)

        train_dir = "/Users/Zanhuang/Desktop/NNP/model.ckpt"

        summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter(train_dir, sess.graph)

        for step in range(100):
            start_time = time.time()
            print(sess.run([train_loss, cost]))
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            if step % 1 == 0:
                num_examples_per_step = FLAGS.batch_size
                examples_per_sec = num_examples_per_step / duration
                sec_per_batch = float(duration)

                format_str = ('%s: step %d, (%.1f examples/sec; %.3f ''sec/batch)')
                print (format_str % (datetime.now(), step, examples_per_sec, sec_per_batch))

                summary_str = sess.run(summary_op)
                summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, step)

                if step % 2 == 0:
                    checkpoint_path = train_dir
                    saver.save(sess, checkpoint_path, global_step = step)


def main(argv = None):
    train()

if __name__ == '__main__':
  tf.app.run()

and the eval is
import tensorflow as tf

import main
import Process
import Input

eval_dir = "/Users/Zanhuang/Desktop/NNP/model.ckpt-98"
checkpoint_dir = "/Users/Zanhuang/Desktop/NNP/checkpoint"


def evaluate():
  with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
    images, labels = Process.eval_inputs()
    forward_propgation_results = Process.forward_propagation(images)
    init_op = tf.initialize_all_variables()
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    top_k_op = tf.nn.in_top_k(forward_propgation_results, labels, 1)

  with tf.Session(graph = g) as sess:
    tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess = sess)
    sess.run(init_op)
    saver.restore(sess, eval_dir)
    for i in range(100):
        print(sess.run(top_k_op))

def main(argv = None):
    evaluate()

if __name__ == '__main__':
  tf.app.run()

What have you tried?

I tried initializing the variables before running the queue's but that only removed the errors. The errors also do not point to any problem thats in the code.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
The output is:
