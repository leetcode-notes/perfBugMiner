Java API Generics Phase 2

This is the big change for generics. The main classes like Tensor and Output acquire type parameters. The test programs have been updated accordingly. Existing code written against the non-generic API should still mostly work but will generate "raw types" warnings. The setup of the tables in the Types class from phase 1 has been centralized into Types itself to ensure it happens early enough.
