Issue re-building with Dockerfile.devel-gpu file

I tried to build my own version of the Dockerfile.devel-gpu with the instructions on this page but got the error as seen in the details below.
After doing some troubleshooting I noticed the tensorflow/core folder wasn't getting created by the git clone statement that's in the Dockerfile.devel-gpu so I updated it to explicitly clone the -b r0.8 branch and it worked successfully. See below for detailed updates. Is this the proper approach to take to resolve this issue or am I missing something?
Executed this command
$ docker build --pull -t $USER:tensorflow-suffix -f Dockerfile.devel-gpu .
Got this error
