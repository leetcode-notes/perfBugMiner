AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'streaming_accuracy'

#Accuracy calculation
accuracy = tf.streaming_accuracy(y_p, mnist.train.lables, weights=None,
                       metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None,
                       name="Accuracy")
acc = sess.run(accuracy)
print (acc)

while calculating Accuracy in my model I encountered this error!
Don't have any clue why?
