Adding instructions for wheel on python3.5

The current python3 wheel installation instructions doesn't work for python3.5, since the pip3 (python3.5) is unable to recognize the wheel file "tensorflow-0.6.0-cp34-none-linux_x86_64.whl" due to the version information contained in the file name "cp34-none". See issue #468
