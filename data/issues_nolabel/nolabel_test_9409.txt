Add scaffolding for running XLA python tests on a plugin backend.

Copy the plugin_config.tpl file to plugin_config.py and configure
the two lines to name the plugin device and types that the device
supports.  The device can the be referred to as 'plugin', eg there
will be test targets called:
tensorflow/compiler/tests:plugin_tests
tensorflow/compiler/test:binary_ops_test_plugin
etc..
