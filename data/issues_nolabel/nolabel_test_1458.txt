CIFAR-10 Model has (almost) pointless ops in distorted_inputs

While preparing an intro talk I noticed something odd happening in cifar10_input.py.
In the following piece of code:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py
    
    
         Line 176
      in
      a641ff6
    
    
    
    

        
          
           distorted_image = tf.image.random_brightness(distorted_image, 
        
    
  


The sequence of ops is: random brightness, which adds a random constant to each pixel, then random contrast, which multiplies the difference from the mean by a random factor ... and then per_image_whitening, which transforms the image to zero mean and unit variance, effectively canceling the previous random operations out, if you don't cross the threshold the per_image_whitening has for low-variance images. That doesn't make sense to me - I would think you want either the data augmentation ops for brightness/contrast OR the whitening to deal with different lighting conditions, but not both. Am I mistaken there?
