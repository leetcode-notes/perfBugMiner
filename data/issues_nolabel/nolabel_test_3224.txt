Error polling for event status: failed to query event: CUDA_ERROR_MISALIGNED_ADDRESS

Summary:
Trying inceptionv3, was working fine all the way until I downgraded gcc 5+ to gcc4.9 to use Theano with keras: following this example http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html
Now hitting this error before training starts (bottlenecks generate fine) whenever i run
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir 
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_event.cc:49] Error polling for event status: failed to query event: CUDA_ERROR_MISALIGNED_ADDRESS
F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_event_mgr.cc:198] Unexpected Event status: 1

Cant figure out the problem. Sidenote that might help: bottlenecks generated alot faster when i used gcc 4.9 instead, but now the training crashes and i cant even run.
Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 16.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
ls: cannot access '/path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*': No such file or directory
It's installed in /usr/local/cuda and /usr/local/cuda-7.5 instead.
CUDA 7.5, CuDNN v4.
Install steps:
CUDA:
bash cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --override
CUDNN:
Tried both:

tar xvzf cudnn-7.0-linux-x64-v4.0-prod.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-7.5/include
sudo cp -r cuda/lib64/. /usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64

If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.

$ export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.9.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL


The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
Steps to reproduce

bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir 
scratch head

What have you tried?
1.literally every other stack overflow / github question. eg, #2810
2.reinstalling cuda 7.5 and cudnn v4, running ./configure. no luck.
