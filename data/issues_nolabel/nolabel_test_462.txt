Building static-linked tensorflow

Have you considered distributing a static-built version of tensorflow so poor uses of old CentOS clusters  with an old glibc could use it? I understand static builds are dirty but it seems that there are many users that would benefit from this solution...
I tried to build tensorflow using an old glibc myself but did not succeed. I guess it could be done but some knowledge of bazel and the internal structure of tensorflow required (and a lot of time!)...
