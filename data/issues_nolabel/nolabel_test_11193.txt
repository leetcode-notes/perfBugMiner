Document building tensorflow-gpu from source?

I have built Tensorflow 1.2 from source with GPU support. However the Python package name is "tensorflow" and not "tensorflow-gpu" as is common. We also have machines that don't have GPUs in them so I'd like to have them both. However I could not find any documentation on how to do this when building from source.
