Batch support for cropping operators

I had a look at the issues and I don't think this has been submitted yet. Sorry if I missed one.
The cropping operators like tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad, tf.image.crop_to_bounding_box, etc only support 3-D tensors. It would be useful to support 4-D tensors for those operators, specially when there are used after the resizing operators, which support 4-D tensor.
Edit: I just saw there was extract_glimpse or crop_and_resize which could works for 4-D tensors. It's confusing to have 2 different functions with different name which seems to perform the same operation with just a different input rank
Edit 2: It's not exactly the same functions. extract_glimpse and crop_and_resize both require normalized coordinates. crop_to_bounding_box use pixel values. It would be good to have a function which allows both pixel based coordinates and 4-D input tensors but anyway, at least there is a way to do what I wanted.
