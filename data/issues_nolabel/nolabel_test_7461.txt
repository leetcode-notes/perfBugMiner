Add aliases to make layer names more consistent?

In the new layers API the convolutional layers have short names (conv1d, conv3d, etc.) while the pooling layers have full names (max_pooling1d, average_pooling3d, etc.) which seems inconsistent. tf.contrib.layers had aliases. Could something like that be added in to the core layers too?
E.g.
max_pool1d = max_pooling1d
convolution1d = conv1d

and so on.
