Describe the problem
Using tf.estimator.DNNClassifier as a multi-class estimator with a string label_vocabulary, tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics will enable additional metrics functions as designed, however the label set pass to the metrics function will be the string tensor of labels, not the internal integer 'label_ids' of  DNNClassifier.
This means the metrics do not have access to the labels used in the prediction tensor 'class_ids' (the tensor 'classes' does have the string labels).  This is a particular problem when trying to construct a confusion_matrix metric, as the confusion matrix tries to cast the labels to int64.
With the canned metrics, DNNClassifier  will simply pass in label_ids/class_ids:
