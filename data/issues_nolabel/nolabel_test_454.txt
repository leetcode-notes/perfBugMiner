Help Needed To Understand Tensor Flow Weights and Gradient Histogram

Hi,
I am experimenting with conv nets for sentiment analysis.
I used a basic convent architecture, my network looks like:

I am trying to analyze the learning, I have a bad feeling about weights, Although I am early in the learning process, but the weights for 5x5 filter essentially suggest no updates/ update on only very few component , because histogram essentially remains the same.
Any hints on what I could be missing?

Everyone has said that, none the less, I would say it too, Thanks for the amazing library.
