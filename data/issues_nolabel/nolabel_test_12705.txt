Verbs fix: Removed Dependency on Duplicate Recv Flag

This PR is a response for #11825
I've added a new Queue and Table for the RdmaTensorBuffer, where the relevant information from the send-recv waiter table is stored in case the actual rdma-write does not occur (If the allocated buffer is too small, or busy). When we get a RDMA_MESSAGE_BUFFER_RESPONSE, or RDMA_MESSAGE_BUFFER_IDLE, we check the new queue/table instead of checking the waiter table. (This happens in the new ReSendNextItem() function).
Also added a new function that generates the callback lambda function, to avoid code redundancy.
The result is that the code is less clean- I am open to suggestions on making it more tidy.
