convert_to_records.py has maybe_download and other functions that are not found.

When I ran convert_to_records.py without changing the file, it would complain maybe_download and other functions that are not found. If you look at the input_data that was imported, it doesn't include the maybe_download as well even with recursive imports.
When I fixed that by copying and pasting from the mnist/convolution.py the download and extraction of the images and label, I ran the fully_connected_reader.py, then it would complain:
W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:909] Invalid argument: Shape mismatch in tuple component 0. Expected [784], got [3136]

Not sure if my fix to convert_to_records.py was wrong or the fully_connected_reader.py was off for some other reason.
