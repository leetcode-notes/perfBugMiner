save_steps in MoniteredTrainingSession

Any reason to omit the save_steps in favor of save_secs for CheckpointSaverHook in MoniteredTrainingSession?

           checkpoint_dir, save_secs=save_checkpoint_secs, scaffold=scaffold)) 
        
    
  


The previous SummarySavorHook has both save_steps and save_secs considered
