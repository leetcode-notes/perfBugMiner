Windows native library (tensorflow_jni.dll) is dynamically linked to msvcp140.dll

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7 SP1 x64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Downloaded from Maven repository
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0

Describe the problem
I need to run TensorFlow on a Windows PC where I don't have admin rights. So I cannot install MS Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable package. And TensorFlow Windows native library (tensorflow_jni.dll) is dynamically linked to msvcp140.dll from that package.
Thus the only option to run TensorFlow for me is to download the DLL from some untrusted "get any DLL" site and put it somewhere in PATH.
I believe it should not be the case. Please consider dropping dependency on MS Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable package.
Or at least mention this dependency clearly in the "Using TensorFlow with a Maven project" section as well as "Install on Windows" here https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_java
