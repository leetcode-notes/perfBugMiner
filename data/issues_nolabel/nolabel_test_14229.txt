tf.contrib.learn.Experiment - train_monitors should be renamed

Shouldn't train_monitors be renamed to train_hooks? As far as I understand hooks replaced monitors.
I look at TF v1.4.0-rc1.
tf.contrib.learn.Experiment(estimator, train_input_fn, eval_input_fn, eval_metrics=None, train_steps=None, eval_steps=100, train_monitors=None, eval_hooks=None, local_eval_frequency=None, eval_delay_secs=120, continuous_eval_throttle_secs=60, min_eval_frequency=None, delay_workers_by_global_step=False, export_strategies=None, train_steps_per_iteration=None, checkpoint_and_export=False)
