remplace .npy weight file from a checkpoint

Hi,
I went modify this line of code (loading weights from pretrained mode):
weights_dict = np.load(self.WEIGHTS_PATH, encoding = 'bytes').item()
where WEIGHTS_PATH is a an npy file WEIGHTS_PATH = 'bvlc_alexnet.npy'
by my own weights saved in checkpoint.
Thanks a lot
