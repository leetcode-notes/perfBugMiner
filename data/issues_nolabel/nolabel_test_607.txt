Fix TensorBoard not displaying any images

The Convolutional Neural Networks/CIFAR-10 tutorial describes how TensorBoard is able to display preprocessed images that have been output through tf.image_summary. However, when viewing the resulting TensorBoard site, the 'Images' tab displays no images at all, and Chrome reports invalid javascript.
Making _getRuns a proper function definition as in this commit fixes the syntax error, and results in TensorBoard actually displaying some images in that tutorial.
