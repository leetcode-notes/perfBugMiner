Avoid use of sufficient_statistics in moments()

When some of the dimensions are unknown, tf.nn.sufficient_statistics() uses reduce_prod to guess the size.
But reduce_prod is not differentiable on GPU (#8841). This commit avoids the usage of sufficient_statistics in tf.nn.moments().
By this way, calling moments() won't involve any transfer between CPU and GPU. This can solve, for example, fchollet/keras#5802.
I didn't know how to test things, so I edited my source a little, downloaded /tensorflow/python/ops/nn_test.py, imported mine and added lines like:
tf.nn.moments = patched_moments
and run the test. It passed all; the unshifted one had unstable output. But I might have done something wrong, so please double-check it.
