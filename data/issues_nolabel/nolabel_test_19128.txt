build with python3 binary uses wrong path to find Python.h (fix inside)

I spent few days fighting issue with building tensorflow where it was unable to find Python.h, and seen number of similar issues.
Python.h was installed as a part of python3-devel, but build system wasnt unable to find it.
Finally i figured out that in tensorflow/third_party/py/python_configure.bzl function _get_python_bin was looking for binary by name python, even once i did configure i told it to use /usr/bin/python3
so i did a workaround by changing python_bin_path=repository_ctx.which("python") to look for python3 instead.
but i guess configure should do that for me.
i had unsupported fedora28 but its not the only distro having both python and python3 binaries
