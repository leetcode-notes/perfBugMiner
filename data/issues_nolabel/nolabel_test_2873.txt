Perform CUDA autoconfiguration in Skylark

Moving the CUDA autoconfiguration to a Skylark repository rule, similar to Bazel's cc_configure, will fix many pain points and build issues that have been reported. This will also eventually allow projects such as Serving and Magenta to include TensorFlow as a Bazel workspace dependency rather than a Git submodule.
Related to this is moving Python detection to a Skylark repository rule (see #1404).
