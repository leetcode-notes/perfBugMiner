"DeprecationWarning: The binary mode of fromstring is deprecated" warning appears in some cases

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary, tf-nightly
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0.dev20180214, git version b2a0f1c
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib.image.ops import gen_distort_image_ops
from tensorflow.python.framework import tensor_util
tensor_util.constant_value(tf.convert_to_tensor([1., 1.]))
Describe the problem
When I run the program above, I get the warning
/home/reedwm/venvs/tfnightlycpu/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py:560: DeprecationWarning: The binary mode of fromstring is deprecated, as it behaves surprisingly on unicode inputs. Use frombuffer instead
  return np.fromstring(tensor.tensor_content, dtype=dtype).reshape(shape)

This may not seem so bad, but when running tf_cnn_benchmarks, I get hundreds of such warnings.
What's very strange is that if I comment the line from tensorflow.contrib.image.ops import gen_distort_image_ops, I don't get the warning.
This is the same issue as ppwwyyxx/tensorpack#641. @yaroslavvb, did you file a TensorFlow bug for this? If so, this can be marked as a duplicate.
Not really sure who to triage this to. /CC @mrry, can you address this or retriage?
