enable unittests for cmake builds

-Dtensorflow_BUILD_CC_TESTS=ON will build cc unit test
-Dtensorflow_BUILD_PYTHON_TESTS=ON will enable python kernel tests
This might still need to work. Tested under windows, it should also work for other platforms.
Not all tests are building and passing yet - the once that don't work are in the variable
tf_test_src_simple_exclude and we'll deal with one at a time (my hope is that exposing the tests makes it easier to recruit some help).
