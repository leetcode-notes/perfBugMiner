Fix crash when `tf.pad` is used with int64 paddings.

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #13506 where int64 data types for bounds in tf.image.pad_to_bounding_box crashes.
The reason of the crash is caused by the fact that int64 was directly converted into int32 without passing through kernel registeration.
This fix fixes the issue by adding typename Tpadding to the template and adds appropriate kernels.
This fix fixes #13506.
