Quantize conv2d transpose

This PR creates a new quantized kernel called QuantizedDeconv2D, which performs a deconvolution computation (also known as conv2d_transpose in TensorFlow) in a quantized mode.
The current progress of this new kernel includes:

A reference implementation of deconvolution
Two unit tests with small dimensions and different strides
Only VALID padding is allowed

Further guidance on this work is welcomed!
