Wrong code in programmer's guide in Variable Section

In Programmer's guide Variable section
 the assignment variable is a tf.Tensor and should use assignment.op.run() instead of assignment.run()
Otherwise, this code would produce an error:
AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'run'

Or we can use sess.run(assignment) to finish this assignment operation
