fix cuda DNN lib path for mac

ddedb9e introduced an error providing a non-existent lib.
From the Tensorflow docs:
https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup under the section: Optional: Setup GPU for Mac:

Finally, you will also want to install the CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN v5) library which currently requires an Accelerated Computing Developer Program account. Once you have it downloaded locally, you can unzip and move the header and libraries to your local CUDA Toolkit folder:
$ sudo mv include/cudnn.h /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/include/
$ sudo mv lib/libcudnn* /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/lib
$ sudo ln -s /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/lib/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib/


The cuDNN v5 library provided by Nvidia at https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download, cudnn-8.0-osx-x64-v5.1.tgz, has libcudnn.5.dylib, not libcudnn.5.
Here's the output of ./configure, run on a Macbook Pro 10.11.6:
