Issue
The Multivariate Normal distribution in contrib.distributions claims to support broadcasting but it does not appear to work. This script will illustrate the issue:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# dimensions
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4

mu = tf.reshape(tf.constant(
    np.arange(a * b * c * 1.0)),
    [a, b, c])

sigma = tf.batch_matrix_diag(tf.reshape(tf.constant(
    np.arange(a * b * c * 1.0) + 1),
    [a, b, c]))

mvn = tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mu, sigma)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # works because shape(input) == shape(mu)
    sess.run(mvn.pdf(np.ones((a, b, c))))

    # fails even though input and mu are broadcastable
    sess.run(mvn.pdf(np.ones((1, a, b, c))))
