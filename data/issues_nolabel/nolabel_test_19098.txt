Use Configuration instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE in MSVC

This uses the Configuration passed to MSBuild instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. You can actually omit CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE during configuration, and the Configuration selected during build is used.
Several of the CMake scripts used Configuration, several used CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, so this is just making things consistent for MSVC.
One less parameter to worry about during configuration and makes it possible to build debug and release from a single configuration.
