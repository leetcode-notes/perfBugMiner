Add int64 support for BroadcastArgs and BroadcastGradientArgs

In array_ops.cc, both int32 and int64 are expected to be supported for BroadcastArgs and BroadcastGradientArgs. However, this was not the case as only int32 kernel are registered even though T is part of the TypeConstraint.
This fix adds the int64 kernel support for BroadcastArgs and BroadcastGradientArgs, and adds related test cases.
