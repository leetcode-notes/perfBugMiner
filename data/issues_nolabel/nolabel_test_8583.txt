Bernoulli's probability mass function produces output beyond its support

Bernoulli's (log) probability mass function is valid for values between 0 and 1, even though its support is only {0, 1}. This is a result of its implementation relying on tf.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, targets), where targets does not have to be {0, 1}.
Is this intended behavior?
from tensorflow.contrib import distributions as ds

x = ds.Bernoulli(p=0.5)
y = x.log_prob(0.5)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(y)
