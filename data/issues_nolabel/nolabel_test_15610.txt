Cannot load pretrained models in Android via jcenter-provided library

It's a great step to support importing Android lib via jcenter. However, I'm having trouble in loading pretrained models into TensorFlowInferenceInterface, which says NodeDef mentions attr 'dilations' not in Op.... I think it's a compatibility issue, meaning that the model graph is not consistent with the graph interpreter. The models directly downloaded from slim and frozen by myself. Anyone can help me?
