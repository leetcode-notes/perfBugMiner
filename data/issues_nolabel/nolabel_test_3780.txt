Added hungarian layer.

Please see initial discussion here for reference. I am submitting a custom layer that is necessary to implement this paper from CVPR 2016. Users of Tensorbox currently must compile Tensorflow from source to use these features, so accepting a variant of this pull request would at least help out those existing users. It would ideally be useful to others as well.
That being said, there are 2 known problems with the pull request:

The code is messy
The hungarian algorithm library itself is not something I can contribute under the Tensorflow license. There is no publicly available hungarian implementation that would satisfy this constraint either. I am holding out hope that Google may have a private implementation of the hungarian algorithm that could be packaged into the repository and satisfy the license constraints. If not, and the only way forward is to write a new implementation, someone (perhaps me) could write a novel hungarian c++ implementation from the details on wikipedia.

Problem (2) has prevented me from really worrying about problem (1).
