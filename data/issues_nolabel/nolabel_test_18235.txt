Fix beam term incorrect usage in BeamSearchDecoder

This PR is to fix #17839.
As raised in the above issue, from the Beam_search wikipedia definition and [Recent academic usage] (http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/05/Papers/0596.pdf), beam search is called beam search because it keeps a beam of search states in memory.
The beam refers to the collection of search states, not the individual search state.
This PR is to fix the incorrect usage of "beam" term in BeamSearchDecoderExamples, like example below:
"The BeamSearchDecoder shuffles its beams"
"beam_width: Python integer, the number of beams"
