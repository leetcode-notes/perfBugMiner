How can I gdb tfcompile by using bazel build?

tfcompile is a binary file to compile an inference graph into executable code for tensorflow XLA which created by bazel build.
If I want to gdb tfcompile file on ubuntu 16.04,  it will return message
Reading symbols from /PWD/tfcompile...(no debugging symbols found)...done.

It seem that should make bazel compile with something flag like -g?
I have tried to use
bazel build XXX --compilation_mode=dbg

but there seems not change anything.
How can I resolve this question?
by the way , I'm working on Ubuntu 16.04, bazel version 0.8.1 tensorflow r1.0
Thanks for any help!
