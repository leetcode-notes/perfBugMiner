TFClassify taking too long to disply result

I am using tensorflow in android. I installed the apk for TFClassify available. I ran the application and it is running swiftly with inference time of not more than 400ms. However when I replaced the available trained model with my model, it is taking around 2000ms for computational before displaying the result. Why is there such a difference and how can I optimize my retrained_graph.pb? I have converted the retrained model to optimized & quantized graph.
