importing and running frozen graph from old version TF produces empty output.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.06
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0 / 7
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080 Ti
Exact command to reproduce:

I have a exported graph file in tensorflow 1.3 version with ubuntu 14.04 (CUDA 7.5 / cudnn 6), and it is working well under the same system so far.
The graph was frozen and I cleared device names when exported it, so it can run both on cpu/gpu mode in my previous machine ubuntu 14.04.
The problem is when I try to run the same graph file in new machine (ubuntu 16.04, tensorflow 1.6, CUDA 9, cudnn 7), the output is just empty.
There were no problem of importing the graph file and no error messages when running it.
Also the output was produced and shape is what expected except the content is empty.
My graph takes an image as input and produce an image as output. And when imported and run the graph in 16.04, the result is just black image.
I also opened the graph using tensorflow/python/tools/import_pb_to_tensorboard.py, and tensorboard visualized the right network I designed.
Also tested with tensorflow version 1.5, 1.4 but the result was same.
Any solution for this problem?
