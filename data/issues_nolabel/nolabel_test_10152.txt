Defragmentation support of BFCAllocator

Describe the problem
From the documentation of the BFCAllocator, it aims to bring defragmentation support, which might be important for GPUs with relatively small memory so that potentially larger graphs can be supported.  The defragmentation part seems to be missing from the current implementation. Is there any plan on this, or any thoughts can be shared?
