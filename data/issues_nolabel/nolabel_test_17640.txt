Fix TensorBoard tutorial links to the wrong MNIST tutorial example code

This PR is to fix #17600.
The TensorBoard guide contains example code that it says "is a modification of the simple MNIST tutorial, in which we have added some summary ops." But the tutorial it links to, https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers, is very different from the example code it gives -- that tutorial uses the tf.layers module to create a CNN, while the example code manually defines a one-hidden-layer fully-connected network.
