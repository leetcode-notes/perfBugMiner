training.slot_creator: support for non-fully-defined shaped vars

This is a possible solution for #5972.
With this patch, the AdamOptimizer (and other optimizers) can optimize variables with non-fully-defined shape which would raise an exception without the patch because primary.get_shape().as_list() does not work.
