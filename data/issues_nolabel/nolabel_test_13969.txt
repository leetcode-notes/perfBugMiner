Centered batch padding with tf.data.Dataset API

Hi,
First of all, kudos for the PaddedBatchDataset op and all the tf.data.Dataset API.
Right now, all the examples in the batch are aligned at coordinate (0, 0, ...). I think it is very convenient in many applications (e.g. image processing) to have the examples "centered" in the batch.
I would like to know if you would accept a pull request in that direction. If so, I am willing to work on this. I suggest to add a flag to the operator so that the user can decide whether she wants the data centered, or aligned at (0, 0, ...), i.e. the current behavior. This changes should not be difficult to make.
