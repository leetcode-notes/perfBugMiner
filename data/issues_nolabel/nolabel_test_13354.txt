Dynamic loading / freeing GPU devices

I wonder whether there are any on-going works or plans on dynamic loading / freeing GPUs.
What I mean by dynamic loading is a client-side feature sess.load_device() like below:
# start with /gpu:0 only
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'
sess = tf.Session()
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
  a = tf.constant(0.5)
sess.run(a)

# add new device /gpu:1
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0,1'
sess.load_device('/gpu:1')
with tf.device('/gpu:1'):
  b = tf.constant(0.3)
sess.run(a + b)

# free device /gpu:0
sess.free_device('/gpu:0')
I'm trying to test whether I can run BaseGPUDeviceFactory::CreateDevices() after the session is created, but if there are any better ways, would you please give me some hints?
