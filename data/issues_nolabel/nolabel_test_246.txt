Examples for loop control flow ops (Enter/Leave/NextIteration)

These are mentioned tantalisingly in the whitepaper, and code for them seems to be present (although omitted from the docs).
It's not clear at all (to me at least) how to use Enter/Leave/NextIteration to actually construct a loop -- an example would be really nice here :-)
In particular I'm interested in whether recurrent networks could be implemented using these constructs, and if there's a reason you chose not to use them in the examples. Is it a case of the looping stuff not being quite ready enough yet in the open source version? Is it that loop control flow doesn't perform as well?
