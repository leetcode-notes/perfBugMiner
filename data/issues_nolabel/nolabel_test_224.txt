TensorFlow for Jetson TK1 (ARM + Cuda)

I have a gpu-enabled build for Jetson TK1 using CUDA 6.5 runtime and CUDNN 6.5.
This is a link to download the binary for the pip install if someone wants to try it:

Jetson  TK1 has a limited amount of memory ( CPU+GPU <2GB) so most of the examples will not run without modifications but aside from  Out Of Memory errors, TensorFlow runs just fine.
