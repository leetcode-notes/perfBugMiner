tensorflow suddenly cannot detect my GPUs

I was working with tensorflow-gpu, and it worked properly before. But just now, suddenly my Tensorflow cannot run on GPU anymore and when I query my devices with list_local_devices(), it shows that I don't have any GPU! But my nvidia-smi properly displayed the info of my 2 GPUs. It's very weird since I did't do anything.
