Having issues with bazel build with respect to patch

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): I'm just compiling
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Redhat 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Installing from source
TensorFlow version (use command below): Tried 1.0, 1.3 and latest
Python version:  2.7.10
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.3
CUDA/cuDNN version: cuda 8/cudnn 5
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: bazel --output_base=./cache build -c opt --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-mavx --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mfma --config=cuda tensorflow_serving/...

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Trying to compile with and without GPU doesn't seem to work for me because of the patch command. For r0.5.1, I can compile successfully without GPU, but for the other later versions, I am getting the following error:
ERROR: error loading package 'tensorflow_serving/resources': Encountered error while reading extension file 'protobuf.bzl': no such package '@protobuf//': Traceback (most recent call last):
