Number of broadcasting dimensions is limited

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.4
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: f92e338
Steps to reproduce
Running this script:
import tensorflow as tf

shape_1 = (1, 20, 30, 1, 50)
shape_2 = (30, 1, 30, 20, 50)

A = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal(shape_1))
B = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal(shape_2))

with tf.Session() as S:
    S.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
    C = S.run(A+B)
produces
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.UnimplementedError: Broadcast between [1,20,30,1,50] and [30,1,30,20,50] is not supported yet.
What did you try?
Reducing the tensor ranks results in success.
shape_1 = (1, 20, 30)
shape_2 = (30, 1, 30)
