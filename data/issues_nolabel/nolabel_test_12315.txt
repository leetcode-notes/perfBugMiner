[CMake] Add missing dependencies on boosted_trees protos and other fixes

This PR fixes some of the CMake targets that are not built as part of CI:

It adds the contrib/boosted_trees protos to the $tf_protos_cc_srcs variable, which ensures that they are built before the corresponding kernels. This enables non-Python targets (such as tf_label_image_example) to be built again.
It excludes the core/kernels/fuzzing code from being built, which enables the CMake build to work on non-Windows platforms. (An #ifndef PLATFORM_WINDOWS was in place to preserve the functioning Windows builds.)
It includes the missing CUDA code for the ZeroInitializerOp when building for GPU.

Fixes #12037. Fixes #12164. Fixes #12277. Fixes #12288. Fixes #12332.
