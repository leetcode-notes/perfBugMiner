Cross-compile Android demo for CUDA

I was wondering how can I build the android demo with GPU support. I have a device with CUDA capability (Tegra K1 device). What I did was to pass a --config=cuda when building the demo. Is it supposed to be enough to enable gpu support by only passing  --config=cuda?
I ./configured the workspace given cuda and cudnn path and also specified proper compute_capability=3.2
Now that the app is running on my device, how can I make sure if it has gpu support? I did not see a noticeable speed up by doing this. So, What is the proper way to run and validate it?
P.S.
I am using CUDA 6.0.
I modified few lines to ignore CUDA 7.5 and use 6.0 instead.
