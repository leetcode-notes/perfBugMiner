[Feature Request] Graph embedding (DeepWalk, LINE, ...)

Hello,
Recently algorithms such as DeepWalk or LINE, by applying word embedding techniques to graph, have opened a way to apply deep learning to graph analysis. I wonder if there is any future plan for Tensorflow to support graph / network analysis in general and graph embedding in specific?
