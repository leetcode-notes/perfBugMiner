[Windows - Bazel] ERROR: No toolchain found for cpu 'x64_windows'

It is more probable to be something related to Bazel but I am posting here as well just in case.
Windows 10 x64
Msys2 v20160205
Bazel 0.4.3 (tested with 0.4.4 as well)
Visual C++ 2015
I get this error when building with Bazel after successfully configuring TensorFlow
$ bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
ERROR: No toolchain found for cpu 'x64_windows'. Valid cpus are: [
  k8,
  piii,
  arm,
  darwin,
  ppc,
].
INFO: Elapsed time: 24.952s

Steps to reproduce:

Compile Bazel or use a pre-built binary (both yielded same result)
Clone TensorFlow repository
Configure TensorFlow
Build it with bazel

I tried so far as suggested:

Configuring again and build (entire log) using:

export BUILD_OPTS='--cpu=x64_windows_msvc --host_cpu=x64_windows_msvc --copt=/w --verbose_failures --experimental_ui'
bazel build -c opt $BUILD_OPTS tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package



Using -c opt instead of --config=cuda.


Running without --config=cuda, which generates the error:
AssertionError: Could not find python binary: python3.exe perhaps related to Bazel issue 2457.


Issue on Bazel.
