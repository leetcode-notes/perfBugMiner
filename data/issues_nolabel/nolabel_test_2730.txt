TensorBoard feature request: Search for Node

I have been trying to retrain the inception v3 network and TensorBoard has been the only real way to introspect the network and it's implementation so far.
It would be very useful to be able to find nodes in the graph, by name or other properties. E.g. in my case I am interested in seeing the total_loss node that is being defined here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/inception_train.py#L120 To get a greater idea of what it is linked to.
