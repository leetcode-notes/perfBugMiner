How to speed upï¼Ÿ why so so slower than caffe

I use tensoflow r11+Titan x+cuda8+cudnnv5
but the speed of training is much slower than caffe.  It can run about 5W epochs with caffe in a night, but only 350 epochs with tensorflow, I don't know why the gap of speed is so big.
If anywhere need I to change? I follow the cifar10 example to suit my experiment
thanks~
