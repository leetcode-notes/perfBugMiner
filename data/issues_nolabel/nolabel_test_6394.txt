Tensorflow GPU Support for Windows?

Hi I installed tensorflow-GPU through pip on my Windows 10 machine and I have also installed the Nvidia Cuda Toolkit and have downloaded cuDNN. But I came to the realization that there was no GPU version for Windows 10. Is it still possible to use the tensorflow-GPU windows 10 given that it is install-able via pip and all the other dependencies can be installed and configued?
