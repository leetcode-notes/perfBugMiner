Communicating channels: gitter.im + discourse

If we're in for the openess and effectiveness of the whole thing...
(1) Why not using gitter.im ?
I also believe we should have a discourse forums, which I'm more than willing to help / set up if you really need (just can't pay for it or move people from the mailing list without being official).
(2) Yes, discourse would be a perfect replacement for the mailing list and to this Issue tracker. :)
