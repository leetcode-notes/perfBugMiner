Couldn't open CUDA library libcupti.so.8.0

Hi,
I've installed 1.0 on my ubuntu 16.04 machine and deployed tf-1.0 with success, at least before I run the example shipped with tf, e.g, mnist_with_summaries.py
When running mnist_with_summaries.py, I got the very problem posted in #5282. The discussion is mainly about the missing libcupti.so and most of them suggested to install or symlink the lib. But both approach didn't work for me.... Since the so file exists when installing CUDA-8.0 under the directory /usr/local/cuda/extra/CUPTI/lib64/, so I thought what I need to do is just link the library under the directory /usr/local/cuda/lib64/. However, problem still exists after the linking. And the libcupti-dev in apt-get is old (v7.5), which fails also.
Anyone could give me some advice? Thanks in advance.
