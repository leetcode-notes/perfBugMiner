Fix gif build on Windows

It fails on Windows because "'unistd.h': No such file or directory". "unistd.h" is included in some source files but never used. I can manually comment out these includes then the target is buildable. Since it's a new_http_archive, the only fix I can think of is to write a genrule to remove those include statments
Ideally, we want the include could be configurable, but that's not true in the source code yet. @mrry @damienmg @dslomov
