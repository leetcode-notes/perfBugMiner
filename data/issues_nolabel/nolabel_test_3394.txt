logdir not recognized as a keyword argument when fitting a DNNRegressor

Hi,
I got the following error when trying to fit a DNNRegressor with this code:
reg=learn.DNNRegressor(hidden_units=[200,20],activation_fn=tf.tanh)
reg.fit(X_train,Y_train,steps=1000,logdir='/tmp/')

TypeError: fit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'logdir'
Was the option to monitor a regressor not implemented yet?
Thanks,
David
