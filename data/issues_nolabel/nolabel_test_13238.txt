Describe the problem
When I run the TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) on a Windows command prompt the colors on the tfdbg screen are practically unreadable on my monitor.   Screen capture in the comment below. The text color is indigo and the background color is black.
I have tried changing the colors on my command prompt but the curses package on tfdbg is changing both the foreground and the background colors on the blue text so that text remains unreadable.
Please change tfdbg so that default palette is readable on all monitors and so that colors can be modified.
