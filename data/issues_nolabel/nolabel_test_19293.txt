Describe the problem
This is a feature request about supporting Mask R-CNN on TensorFlow Lite. Thanks.
Source code / logs
Currently, the following operators are not supported by TensorFlow Lite: ResizeNearestNeighbor, Stack, and TensorFlowShape.
Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: ResizeNearestNeighbor, Stack, TensorFlowShape.
