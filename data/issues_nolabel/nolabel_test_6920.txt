can tensorflow CPU version be updated to GPU version without uninstalling ?

python 3.5
tensorflow 0.11.0
Hello,
I wanted to do FFT operations using tensorflow. does this CPU version support working of that ?
In some post I have seen we cannot perform FFT on CPU version of tensorflow. If so can I change the tensorflow version of CPU to GPU without installing it ?
I need to work on the LSTM algorithm as well further.
