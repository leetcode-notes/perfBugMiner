tf.decode_csv New Feature Request option to remove leading/trailing whitespace on text fields

tf.decode_csv currently allows leading and trailing spaces with int or float fields and quietly strips the whitespace off, see: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/decode_csv
It would be really nice if the text fields could also have the leading/trailing whitespace stripped off. The embedded whitespace in a text field or sentence does need to be left intact, although it might be useful to compress it down to a single space between words.
Pandas.read_csv has an option skipinitialspace to strip leading/trailing whitespace, which defaults to False. I would suggest a similar option for tf.decode_csv for text fields. If you wanted to aggressively deploy the option, you could default it to True.
Currently I remove whitespaces via a call to tf.py_func and a small rexexp function. There is also tf_regex_replace which works.
