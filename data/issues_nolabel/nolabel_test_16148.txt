Describe the problem
I train my RFCN by tensorflow. My project need very high speed. So I use the profile and I find that non_max_suppression is on CPU? Is there a GPU version?I think if you calculate all pairs of boxes IOU first, then just for-loop once will ultimately boost speed, there have some trick in it, just see the source code in https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/tree/master/lib/nms. I think cuda version of NMS is faster than CPU version.
