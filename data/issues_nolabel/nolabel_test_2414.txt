how to run lstm on multi gpus?

I run a example of lstm on multi gpus using codes in models/image/cifar10, but it turns out that Attempting to use uninitialized value lstm/LSTMCell/W_0. I have read the issues 1390, so I have a question if the implementation of lstmcell is ok. when I want to store variables on cpu, and run ops on gpu, the implementation of lstmcell do initialization of w in blackbox, then variables and ops must be in the same place, cpu or gpu, it's not a good idea, right?
