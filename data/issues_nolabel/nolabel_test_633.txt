tf.decode_csv works with \n but not with \r\n for new lines

I copied the example for reading CSV files from here and used it with csv files that I generated (5 columns, comma seperated) which used \r\n as line breaks which resulted in the following error:

W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:1076] 0x1659ea0 Compute status: Invalid argument: Unquoted fields cannot have quotes/CRLFs inside

Using only \n worked as expected. According to the standard using \r\n is also valid.
I'm using docker for windows and used the latest docker image, I haven't tried it on other machines.
