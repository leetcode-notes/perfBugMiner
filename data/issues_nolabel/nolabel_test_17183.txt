Describe the problem
Since the sequence_length parameter of CTC functions are each dependent on the input (specifically the number of time steps), why not let them determine the sequence lengths themselves? Or have a separate function that determines the sequence lengths.
Source code / logs
I was thinking of adding something like this to ctc_loss (assuming inputs are batch major and of shape [None, num_time_steps, num_classes]):
batch_size = input.shape[0]
sequence_length = input.shape[1]
sequence_lengths = tf.fill([batch_size], sequence_length)  

Unfortunately, this throws an error.
TypeError: Expected int32 passed to parameter 'dims' of op 'Fill', got [Dimension(None)] of type 'list' instead.
