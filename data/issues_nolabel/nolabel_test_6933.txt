cuDevicePrimaryCtxSetFlags not found issue on Windows 7

I have successfully loaded tensorflow in python 3.5. But when I start a session, it gave me the following error and python will crash:

My graphic card is NVDIA  quadro K1100M with cuda compute capability 3.0. I have cuda toolkit 8.0 and cudnnv5.1 installed. I tried different nvdia drivers but none is working. If the driver is too old, it will give me insufficient version number to be used with cuda. If the drive is new, my computer just freeze and saying the graphic card is not removable or cannot ejected. Could someone help me with this? Thanks.
