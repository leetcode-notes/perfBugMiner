Tensorflow Cifar-10 evaluation error: Enqueue operation was cancelled

Operating System: Mac Os X 10.9.5
Current tensorflow version 0.7.1
I am trying to get the Cifar-10 tutorial running on my own data set (so using other images, but the same code). Training works fine. However, the evaluation seems to have a problem. Whenever I run the evaluation, I get the following message:

I tensorflow/core/kernels/queue_base.cc:286] Skipping cancelled enqueue attempt
Right before this message, if I let the code run long enough, I get the output for a precision (precision @ 1 = xxx). However, the message still irritates me, I looks like an error message...
I've googled this error, and so far I've only found some posts talking about that one should first initialize placeholders before starting the queuerunners. However, since there are no placeholders used anywhere in the code before, and I am very new to tensorflow/machine learning in general, I have no idea where one would put these placeholders, or what they would be.
