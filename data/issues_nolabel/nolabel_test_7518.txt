How to build static libraries and link them to a c++ project in linux platform?

I am working on a text-classification project, which is big and doesn't use bazel as its build tool. I want to integrate tensorflow into my project, but I find it is hard to change my build tool to bazel. So I wish to  build static libraries on tensorflow and link them into my project.
Does anyone know how to build standalone static libraries and link them in the existing c++ project? Thanks a lot.
