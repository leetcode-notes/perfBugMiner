Update Eigen version to fix CUDA 8 compilation error (second attempt)

The last attempt (#3818) at fixing the compilation errors in didn't work, because bitbucket turned the merged PR into an empty commit: https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/commits/5fea06b2707993a43c5b31105b8224266ecc2c8f.
This PR now definitely updates Eigen to a version that includes the fixes.
