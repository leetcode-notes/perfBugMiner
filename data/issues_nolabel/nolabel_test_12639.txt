There are sudden change in validation line

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Os platform version: Win10
**install From conda:
tensorflow version :tensorflow 1.1
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 5.0
GPU model and memory: GTX1080ti

Describe the problem
[I resume weights model from local. I find there are sudden change in validation line, but my train line don't this problem. I think maybe there are something wrong with tensorflow source code.]
below is train history graph

Source code / logs
`		if RESUME:
print('Restoring previously trained model at %s' % MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
saver.restore(sess, MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
		# Restore previous loss history
		with open('loss_history.p', 'rb') as f:
			loss_history = pickle.load(f)
	else:
		print('Training model from scratch')
		# Variable initialization
		sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

		# For book-keeping, keep track of training and validation loss over epochs, like such:
		# [(train_acc_epoch1, valid_acc_epoch1), (train_acc_epoch2, valid_acc_epoch2), ...]
		loss_history = []`
