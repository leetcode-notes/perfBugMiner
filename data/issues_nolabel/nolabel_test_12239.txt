Fix tf.image.central_crop return zero dimension

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #10315 where tf.image.central_crop will return (0, 0, 3) when input is (240, 320, 3).
The issue is that the calculation was done by dividing
fraction_offset = int(1 / ((1 - central_fraction) / 2.0))

which causes deviation when accuracy is not enough.
This fix did the calculation in double (and use multiply) until the last step.
A test case has been added.
This fix fixes #10315.
