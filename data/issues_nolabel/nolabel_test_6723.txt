Fix build errors on AVX2+ hosts with -march=native.

third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/FixedPoint and third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/Tensor use different paths to reach into unsupported/Eigen/CXX/src/Tensor. The former's paths cause the build errors documented in #6558. This commit converges on the path in third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/Tensor, which fixes the build error.
I tested the PR with the following command, which fails without the patch.
bazel build -c opt --copt=-march=native //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so
