Basic implementation of immediate execution mode for TensorFlow

This version implements Immediate execution for native TensorFlow ops with graph caching:
IE, you can do
    tf = immediate.Env()
    val = np.ones(())
    tensor1 = immediate.Tensor.numpy_to_tensor(env, val)
    tensor2 = immediate.Tensor.numpy_to_tensor(env, val)
    tensor3 = tf.add(tensor1, tensor2)   # executes operation immediately
    tensor3 = tf.add(tensor3, tensor2)   # executes operation without modifying graph
    print tensor3


What's not implemented yet (rough implementation detail is in the design doc):

support for "tf.nn" namespace
support for manually created Python ops
caching for get_session_tensor and get_session_handle ops
