virtualenv install python issues.

While installing virtualenv for tensorflow, I get the following error.
The executable /Users/xxx/tensorflow/bin/python is not functioning ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is
'/Users/xxx' (should be '/Users/xxx/tensorflow')
It seems it is common and related to having python3 or conda installed. But I could not find a known solution.
On my OS Sierra 10.12.3 machine, I have Conda 1.4.3 (python 3.6) installed (came with standard Conda install).
Thanks.
