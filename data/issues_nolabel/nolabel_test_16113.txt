Propagate the error string of GIF processing for decode_gif

This fix tries to improve the error thrown by decode_gif to include the error string generated by GIF processing.
Previously, the error was not very indicative as the error string
returned by GIF processing was hidden:
..........
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Invalid GIF data, size 2091369
	 [[Node: DecodeGif = DecodeGif[_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](ReadFile)]]

This fix propagate the error string (can't process optimized gif) to be part of the InvalidArgumentError:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Invalid GIF data (size 2091369), can't process optimized gif
         [[Node: DecodeGif = DecodeGif[_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](ReadFile)]]

This fix fixes #15838.
