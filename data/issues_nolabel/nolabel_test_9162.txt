Stop gradient for some entry of a tensor

As far as I know, the tf.stop_gradient function can only stop the gradient of a whole tensor. I recently wanted to implement a model that requires the stop of gradient for some entry of a tensor (not the whole tensor). and I have come up with an workaround,
def entry_stop_gradients(target, mask):
    mask_h = tf.logical_not(mask)
    
    mask = tf.cast(mask, dtype=target.dtype)
    mask_h = tf.cast(mask_h, dtype=target.dtype)
    
    return tf.stop_gradient(mask_h * target) + mask * target

hope somebody could implement a low level version of this feature.
