ZeroMQ Operator

Currently (it seems like) the encouraged way to read data is either through the provided reader/producer ops which are not quite flexible, or through python feed_dict which is slower.
Is there a plan to support something like a ZeroMQReaderOp, which keeps reading and deserializing tensors from a zmq socket and produce them? This way we can use any comfortable way to process data perhaps in an independent process, and send them through zmq for training.
