Cifar10 example bug (batch #5 not loading)

In tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10.py it says:
filenames = [os.path.join(FLAGS.data_dir, 'cifar-10-batches-bin',
                        'data_batch_%d.bin' % i)
           for i in xrange(1, 5)]

which will only load batches 1 to 4, while batch number 5 is ignored entirely. This would be correct imo:
for i in xrange(1, 6)]
