Model behavior changes after saving and restoring!

Hi there,
My tf version is 1.2.1.
It's Okay if I feed the test data after model training, to get an accuracy of 98%.
But after I save and restore the model. The accuracy will only be around 10%. What happened...
Besides, I think the accuracy from the test data should be a constant given that weights and biases won't be updated after training, but each time the accuracy is slightly different. Say, 0.1012, 0.9982, things like that...
Any help?
