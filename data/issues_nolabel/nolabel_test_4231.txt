variable_scope raise exception if reuse=False and no name_or_scope

Right now variable_scope raises an exception if reuse=True and there is no name_or_scope, but there is no similar error when reuse=False (explicitly set and not using default of None).
Obviously no error should be raised when reuse=None but I think as a safety check if I have explicitly set reuse=False, then I do want to raise an error if I have forgotten to set the scope for a given layer / node.
I am using this construct in tf-slim to deal with creating a different graph for training vs validation. Right now if I forget to assign a scope to a given layer, than the call to create the graph will not fail even though I want it to.
