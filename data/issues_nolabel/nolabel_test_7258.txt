Building a .dll on Windows

I have built libtensorflow.so with Bazel and used it successfully with the C Api in Ubuntu, however I was wondering if it is possible at all to use Bazel to build a .dll extension to use for Windows? As I want to integrate TensorFlow into an existing project.
Thanks in advance
