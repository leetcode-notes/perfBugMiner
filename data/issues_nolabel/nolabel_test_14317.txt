added reuse in kwargs checking for reusing shared variable

When I am implementing DeepID2 from "Deep Learning Face Representation by Joint
Identification-Verification by Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang", I realise that using same architecture for two inputs (two face image) and sharing weight (if I didn't misunderstand) when feedforward, there is a layer called locally connected convolution, and only keras implemented LocallyConnected2D, when I trying to reuse weight, but failed because the layer didn't allow "reuse" as a kwargs, so when I added it, it seems working (I am not expert in deep learning, so I am not sure if I am doing it correct, so I'm always trying any way)
