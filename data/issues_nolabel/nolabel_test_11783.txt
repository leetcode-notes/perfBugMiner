tf.estimate quickstart

I am in the process of making jupyter notebooks from the tensorflow documentation.
( https://github.com/reedkotler/tensorflow-notebooks )
The tensorflow.org page on tf.esimator quickstart (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn)  had numerous problems.
I've straightened out the coding issues and the fixes are in my notebook https://github.com/reedkotler/tensorflow-notebooks/blob/master/get_started/estimator/estimator.ipynb
I still have some more markup text to straighten out.
Aide from the python2/3, tensoflow 1.2, etc. issues, the actual test case was not predicting properly. I made my own simple one and it predicted just fine so I did not spend time trying to figure out whether the original was wrong or not.
I'm not volunteering to fix the main tensorflow markdown because I'm against the idea of having so much code there that can't be tested and is constantly breaking because tensorflow is changing and so I don't want to try and fix that with no way to test it and to give people something bulletproof that will work. There are lots of posts going unanswered in stackoverflow for 6 months of more on many of these pages, and for this scikit learn one especially because people know that already and it's an obvious starting place for newbies.
