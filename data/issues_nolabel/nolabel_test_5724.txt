enabling VocabularyProcessor.transform to also return document length.

Currently, VocabularyProcessor.transform() ( and VocabularyProcessor.fit_transform() ) do not return the sequence length of ( number of tokens in )  individual raw documents. sequence lengths are required when dealing with variable length sequences ( eg. like dynamic_rnn where we need to also pass the lengths of individual sequences).
After the changes in PR, both fit_transform() and fit() has following signature -

VocabularyProcessor.fit_transform( raw_documents, return_docs_len=False, unused_y=None)
VocabularyProcessor.transform( raw_documents, return_docs_len=False)

Setting return_docs_len=True makes above function to also yield the number of token in individual documents.
