Use cub::ReduceByKey to count partition indices

This implements a suggestion made by @ekelsen in the comments for #13905.
It replaces the previously custom-made counting method, and is likely more efficient.
In order to use cub::ReduceByKey properly, I defined a specialization of TransformOutputIterator that only allows writes in a bounded interval. This is needed in the case of wrong inputs.
I've also added tests for the GPU kernel, covering the case of wrong inputs.
