ImportError: No module named tensorflow

I followed the steps for Anaconda installation for the CPU install of Tensorflow. (r0.9)
Despite installation completing successfully in my conda environment on CentOS, I am unable to import tensorflow
Environment info
Operating System:  CentOS 7.2.1511
Python 2.7.11 Anaconda 4.0.0 (64-bit)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
