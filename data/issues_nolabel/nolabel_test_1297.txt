Exception thrown running  example/udacity/5_word2vec

Hi all. Does anyone reproduce this? The description of the problem is below in the suggested format. A brief summary is: running the examples/udacity/4_convolutions.ipynb runs fine on gpu, but the 5_word2vec notebook fails  with an AdaGrad-related exception:
InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'Adagrad/update_Variable_2/SparseApplyAdagrad': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '' because the node was colocated with a group of nodes that required incompatible device '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/GPU:0'
though I never modified the code (except to print some things out). I never modified code to assign any ops to a device, as it seems to be claiming.
This looks at least superficially related to this issue.
Thanks,
Jim

Steps to reproduce

Run jupyter notebook in the examples/udacity/ directory.
Open the 5_word2vec.ipynb notebook in the web browser (from http://localhost:8888).
Execute each of the steps through the first (Google-provided) session.run().
Observe the exception when you get to the first session.run() after 'Train a skip-gram model.' step, which is provided by notebook (before I have to write any code). The exception happens on the line with session.run() invocation.

InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'Adagrad/update_Variable_2/SparseApplyAdagrad': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '' because the node was colocated with a group of nodes that required incompatible device '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/GPU:0' [[Node: Adagrad/update_Variable_2/SparseApplyAdagrad = SparseApplyAdagrad[T=DT_FLOAT, Tindices=DT_INT64, use_locking=false](Variable_2, Variable_2/Adagrad, Adagrad/learning_rate, gradients/concat_2, gradients/concat_3)]]
I have not modified the python code assign to do any device assignments in this notebook.
What have you tried?

I've been working through the Udacity DeepLearning course. After encountering this error, I killed the jupyter kernel for 5_word2vec, and re-run my previously-saved notebook for the fourth exercise, 4_convolutions.ipynb, and it executes without error on the gpu. Which I think must confirm that TensorFlow is installed OK.

Done for the day, but when I come back, I will probably try building without gpu support, and see if that runs OK so I can at least carry on with the course.
