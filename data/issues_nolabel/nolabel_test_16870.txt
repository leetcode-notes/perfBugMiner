Improve shape function of SampleDistortedBoundingBox and fix some test cases

This fix tries to improve the shape function of SampleDistortedBoundingBox and fix several test case errors.
As is shown in the kernel of SampleDistortedBoundingBox, the shape of SampleDistortedBoundingBox are required to be 1-D [height, width, channels] for image_size, 3-D with shape [batch, N, 4] for bounding_boxes.
In the test case, the uses shape is incorrect but because there was no check in shape function, the test case passes. (The test case only works for shape but will thrown out an error if run)
This fix adds the shape check for SampleDistortedBoundingBox, and fixes the incorrect test cases.
