[XLA] Reorder the parameters in a map inline operation according to the parameter number

The inliner (not typically in use) has a fault where it doesn't spot that the parameters within the mapped operation are not in the same order as the actual parameter numbers on the operands.
i.e. the mapped operation looks like:
  Param(1)         Param(0)
      |              |
      -- Binary-op ---
            |

Previously the operands were passed to the clone in the order that they were supplied to the binary op - not the order as defined by the parameter numbers.
This fixes the issue (which could be potentially be called b/35786417)
