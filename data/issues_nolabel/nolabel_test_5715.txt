Problems importing Tensorflow to PyCharm and IDLE

I am currently trying to use Tensorflow on PyCharm and IDLE. However, whenever I try to import Tensorflow (import tensorflow as tf), I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

From looking around online, it seems that I need to install cuda on my machine. However, I do not have a NVIDIA graphics card nor a cuda-enabled card.
