Describe the problem
Hello, I get error 1002 when compiling tensorflow r1.3 with vs2015 in tf_core_kernels , use DEBUG mode without GPU, which occured during compilation of GPU version too. I belive I have enough memory for compilation. However, I compiled successfully through RELEASE mode without error.
Same issue in tensorflow-r1.2.
