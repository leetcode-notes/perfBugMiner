Android Camera Demo Error when trying to replace default inception model

Hey,
I am trying tu run the android camera demo with different model.
To get a simple use case, I started with a retrained inception model produced from the TensorFlow for Poets codelab tutorial classifying flowers.
What I have done ?
I place the new model pb file and the new label txt file in the assets directory.
I followed the recommendations specified in the ClassifierActivity.java file
1/ set IMAGE_SIZE = 299, IMAGE_MEAN = 128, IMAGE_STD = 128
2/ set INPUT_NAME = "Mul:0", and OUTPUT_NAME = "final_result:0"
I bazel build and install the apk file.
Running the app, I got this error in the logcat
E/native: tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:138 Could not create Tensorflow Graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:   [[Node: DecodeJpeg = DecodeJpeg  acceptable_fraction=1, channels=3, dct_method="", fancy_upscaling=true, ratio=1, try_recover_truncated=false]]
To my understanding this node is preceding my input node and is useless in this case.
What is the solution to get rid of it ?
Thanks in advance for your answer.
Alex
