Import numpy before a call to sys.setdlopenflags

Must import numpy before a call to sys.setdlopenflags, or there may be a segfault in certain situations. Fixes #2034.
The situation occurs when users have compiled TensorFlow, but use binary distributions of SciPy. Alternatives to this patch would be documentation stating that users who compile TensorFlow from source should also recompile SciPy if they need it.
