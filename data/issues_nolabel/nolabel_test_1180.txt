Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
Steps to reproduce

pip install --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow
Download Cuda Toolkit v 7.5 from: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/7.5/Prod/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-7-5-local_7.5-18_amd64.deb
Install cuda toolkit 7.5:
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-7-5-local_7.5-18_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
Download cuDNN v4: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/assets/cudnn-70-linux-x64-v40
Followed by:
tar xvzf cudnn-7.0-linux-x64-v4.0-prod.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
Add the following to the end of ~/.bashrc file:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64"
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
Activate the Virtualenv environment created in step 2: source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
Finally install tensorflow with GPU support enabled: pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl

What have you tried?

I have tried to test the tensorflow installation as described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#test-the-tensorflow-installation
and it gives me the same import error as above.
I deleted all of the virtual folder (incl contents) and removed cuda toolkit and cudNN and installed them, repeating 3 times, but it doesn't seem to go pass the import error.

Please if anyone could help out, a whole lot of time has gone by with this ...
