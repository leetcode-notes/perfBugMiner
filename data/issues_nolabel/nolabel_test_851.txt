tensorflow for Nvidia TX1

Hello,
@maxcuda has recently got tensorflow running on the tk1 as documented in blogpost http://cudamusing.blogspot.de/2015/11/building-tensorflow-for-jetson-tk1.html but since then been unable to repeatedly build it. I am now trying to get tensorflow running on a tx1 tegra platform and need some support.
Much trouble seems to come from Eigen variadic templates and using C++11 initializer lists, both of wich could work according to http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/cplusplus-11-in-cuda-variadic-templates/.
In theory std=c++11 should be set according to crosstool. Nevertheless, nvcc crashes happily on all of them. This smells as if the  "-std=c++11"  flag is not properly set.
How can I verify/enforce this?
Also in tensorflow.bzl, variadic templates in Eigen are said to be disabled
We have to disable variadic templates in Eigen for NVCC even though std=c++11 are enabled
is that still necessary?
Here is my build workflow:
git clone â€”recurse-submodules git@github.com:jmtatsch/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
grep -Rl "lib64"| xargs sed -i 's/lib64/lib/g' # no lib64 for tx1 yet 
./configure
bazel build -c opt --local_resources 2048,0.5,1.0 --verbose_failures --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
