Tensorboard URL for visiting

Run last week into the 'issue' that one of the users tried to go to http://0.0.0.0:6006 as instructed on the command line.
$ python tensorboard.py --logdir ~/tmp/logs/
Starting TensorBoard b'23' on port 6006
(You can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:6006)
Modified the message that if FLAGS.host is 0.0.0.0 it identifies the correct IP-address for showing in the message (in this case the local-IP is 172.16.3.13)
$ python tensorboard.py --logdir ~/tmp/logs/
Starting TensorBoard b'23' on port 6006
