Documentation of tf.nn.raw_rnn is confusing

The documentation for the tf.nn.raw_rnn displays the following line as the pseudocode for the function:

(finished, next_input, initial_state, _, loop_state) = loop_fn( time=time, cell_output=None, cell_state=None, loop_state=None)

This is the first time the loop_fn is called by the raw_rnn interface. Here, the '_' for the emit_output returned by the loop_fn is a do not care for the function. This misleads the user into believing that returning None for the first time as the emit_output is OK.
However, the actual code has the line:

(elements_finished, next_input, initial_state, emit_structure, init_loop_state) = loop_fn( time, None, None, None) # time, cell_output, cell_state, loop_state

The code uses the emit_structure from the emit_output that then determines the shape of the emitted output to be aggregated in the emit_ta array.
So, even for the first time the loop_fn needs to output a mock tensor for setting the shape of the output values.
The documentation needs to include this as going through the framework implementation for figuring this out is too tiresome.
