The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I also used data from hd5f file, before the tf.Session I extract the data first.
It works for the 200000 iterations, but when it comes more than 200000 the program will be terminated.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried to re-install cudnn 4.0
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
