Bazel can't build anymore?

Was a BUILD file or something recently changed?
This works perfectly fine:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/core:tensorflow --verbose_failures || exit 1
This fails (gets stuck):
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures || exit 1
and gets stuck on:
bazel build --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

stuck on "Loading package", can't find anything in the logs. Tried the whole shebang of bazel clean and another server, doesn't work on different machines as well... any ideas?
