[Solved, please close it] cuda 7.5 and tensorflow 0.7.1 error: cuda_gpu_executor.cc could not open file to read NUMA node

Hi, when test tensorflow after installation, I get the titled error.

cuda_gpu_executor.cc  could not open file to read NUMA node: /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:00.0/numa_node

In fact my cuda toolkit runs properly, and I can run all samples in it.
When run import tensorflow as tf and hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!'), nothing is wrong and cuda libs can be found and loaded by tensorflow.
BTW, my GPU is GTX 980TI and my os is Slackware current 64. Latest driver is installed.
Thanks.
