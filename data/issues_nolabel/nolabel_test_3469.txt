Raspberry Pi Bazel Build "Define appropriate PLATFORM macro" error

When building TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi with Bazel, the pre-compiler end up throwing this error:
Define the appropriate PLATFORM_<foo> macro for this platform

From what I've been able to gather, here's the cause of the issue:

Because Raspberry Pi uses an ARM CPU, the IS_MOBILE_PLATFORM macro is defined in `tensorflow/core/platform/platform.h
Later, when trying to compile png.h, gif.h, or jpeg.h, the if/else statements fall through, leaving with the default option to throw an error.

Environment info
Operating System: Raspbian GNU/Linux, version 8.0
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: N/A
Installed from source.

Steps to reproduce

Build TensorFlow from source on Raspberry Pi as described in this guide without deleting this line from tensorflow/core/platform/platform.h, which defines IS_MOBILE_PLATFORM when compiling on ARM devices.

What have you tried?

Deleted the line mentioned above, which fixes the problem for local builds
