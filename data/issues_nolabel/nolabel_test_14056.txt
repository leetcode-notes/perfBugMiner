Half Normal Distribution (and inverse error function)

Inverse Error Function
Added erfinv as a simple function of ndtri (the api mirrors the approach taken in scipy.special. Mainly to prevent distributions with methods in terms of the inverse error function reimplementing their own wrappers around ndtri.
Half Normal Distribution
X ~ Normal(0.0, scale)
Y = |X|
# then Y ~ HalfNormal(scale)
Added the Half Normal distribution to contrib.distributions. Main things to look at is how I'm dealing with the pdf discontinuity.
A discontinuity in the pdf that sends values to 0.0 is easy to represent in prob, (by multiplying my a tensor with 0.0s at the relevant positions) than log_prob (which requires masking -inf wherever x < 0). I'd be interested if anyone has any suggestions for correct ways to implement the latter, as I think this is a case where log_prob is more numerically stable (along the support of the distribution that is).
