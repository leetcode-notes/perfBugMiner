The "cos" merge mode when using tf as backend cann't get the expect result

I have two batch of sentences as inputs, like:
a = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0,1,0,0,0]], dtype='int32')
b = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0,0,2,0,0]], dtype='int32')
vec = model.predict([a, b])

In my model, I trying to get the cos score between two vector, so I use 'cos' model in merge
cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=1)
When I use theano as backend, it works fine, but when I use tf as backend, the output_shape=[batch_size, batch_size]
The result by 'tf' backend:
[[ 0.99999994  0.97052568]
 [ 1.0303694   0.80238068]]

The result by 'theano' backend:
[[ 1.        ]
 [ 0.80238068]]

This is caused by tf.batch_matmul,

The input tensors x and y are 3-D or higher

But I just input 2-D vectors. I think it have to be expanded when the input shape is 2-D
BTW, My solution is:
if (keras.backend.backend() == "theano"):
    cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=1)
else:
    vec_a = RepeatVector(1)(vec_a)
    vec_b = RepeatVector(1)(vec_b)
    cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=2)
    cos_score = Flatten()(cos_score)

Sorry about my English ðŸ˜ƒ
