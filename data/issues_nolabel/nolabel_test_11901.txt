Make Windows Bazel GPU build work again

This change mainly fixed the Windows GPU build.
Besides it also has some other fixes and improvments.


print installed Bazel version in configure.py


Remove slice_op_gpu.cu.cc from strided_slice_op because it's already in slice_op


Mark some failing GPU tests as no_windows_gpu


Add /DNOGDI flag for some targets to fix GPU build


Update TF_CUDNN_VERSION to 6.0


add test filters -no_gpu, -no_pip_gpu
