Installing from source - problem with bazel

I was following the instructions for installing from source. However, installing bazel from the specified checkout, however I encountered the error from this issue:
bazelbuild/bazel#321
This was fixed by editing the compile.sh and changing the c++0x to c++11. However now I'm getting the following issue, which unfortunately did not find any relevant information from google:

Do you know for any workarounds or at least idea how to fix it.
