hi all, I have successfully installed tensorflow in my computer, but I encountered the following problem when import tensorflow in python 2.7 environment:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:128] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so.7.0 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:128] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.4 locally

IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/protobuf-3.1.0.post1-py2.7.egg/EGG-INFO/namespace_packages.txt'

By searching online, I can solve this error by
sudo chmod o+r /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/protobuf-3.1.0.post1-py2.7.egg/EGG-INFO/namespace_packages.txt

However, does anyone has other solutions, since I DO NOT want use sudo frequently?
Btw, can anyone solve another confusion of mine? I installed tensorflow from source according to the tensorflow's tutorial. But I don't quite understand the differences of the following commands used in my installation:
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.12.0rc1-py2-none-any.whl

and
python setup.py develop

It seems to me that these two commands all install tensorflow in my system and they all need sudo privilege to work. I also see from tensorflow installation guide that the second command is for development. Could anyone explain in more detail about the differences and purposes of them?
Thanks in advance!
