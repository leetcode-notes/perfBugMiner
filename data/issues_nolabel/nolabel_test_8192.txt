No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs on ios

hey,everyone!
At first,i can run the demo in /ios_examples/camera successfully.then I use retrain.py to retrain with my own dataset,and get a output_graph.pb flie and a output_labels.txt file.after that, I replace the files in  /ios_examples/camera/data with them,and run the demo again,but it failed ,error description  are as follow:
####error#########
