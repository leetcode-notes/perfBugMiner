CTC decoding with dictionary

Is there a possibility to use the CTC decoding algorithms provided by TF with a (word) dictionary?
I've seen that there is some testing-code which seems to do just what I want:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/util/ctc/ctc_beam_search_test.cc
Is there a Python interface for this task?
Or do I have to build a custom operation out of the code shown above to be usable in Python?
