Fix building for iOS #4640

Seems like the reason why compilation fails does not directly related to TensorFlow or even Protobuf:
The configure script of Protobuf (generated by autogen) has non trivial logic for detecting cross-compilation (currently there checks can be found in lines 3918â€“3976 at configure file). It tries to compile some simple C programs into executable and run it during the configuration process. It works fine except the case when we build for x86_64 iOS simulator: one the one hand we get native code for build platform one the other hand we can not execute test program because it is based on iOS sdk. As result the configure script generates error.
Frankly speaking I still do not fully understand the logic behind cross-compilation check, however I've found workaround for building Protobuf and TensorFlow for all platforms including x86_64 iOS simulator. The workaround is simple: just remove --build=x86_64-apple-${OSX_VERSION} \ string for x86_64 in compile_ios_protobuf.sh file. Note, for consistency I also removed same strings for all other platforms (x386, armv7, armv7s, arm64), however it doesn't seems necessary.
My platform: macOS Sierra 10.12.1, Xcode 8.1, autoconf 2.69 (installed via homebrew).
