Build error: missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'external/jpeg_archive

I have problem when building r0.9 source code without GPU, always have below errors:
ERROR: /home/hadoop/.cache/bazel/_bazel_hadoop/688bf433e3d98b943fba735d08e17b8c/external/jpeg_archive/BUILD:77:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '@jpeg_archive//:jpeg':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'external/jpeg_archive/jpeg-9a/jdatasrc.c':
'bazel-out/host/genfiles/external/jpeg_archive/jconfig.h'.
The error file is changed if I run bazel build again, in fact the file exists in the directory.
There is no problem when I build TF master source code, version 0.11.
bazel version is 0.3.2-jdk7.
Build command:
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --local_resources 4096,.5,1.0
I saw some fix  are related with GPU, but I didn't configure GPU.
