warnings building Tensorflow 1.7 from source

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
no, just tensorflow 1.7.0
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
installed from source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.7.0
Python version:
3.6.5 (Anaconda)
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9) 5.4.0 20160609
CUDA/cuDNN version:
9.1 / 7.1.2
GPU model and memory:
GeForce GTX 980, 4GB
Exact command to reproduce:

source activate python36
./configure

Please specify the location of python. [Default is /home/hunterwolf/anaconda3/envs/python36/bin/python]: 

Found possible Python library paths:
  /home/hunterwolf/anaconda3/envs/python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/home/hunterwolf/anaconda3/envs/python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages]

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 9.0]: 9.1

Please specify the location where CUDA 9.1 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: /usr/local/cuda-9.1

Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 7.0]: 7.1.2

Please specify the location where cuDNN 7 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda-9.1]:

Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size. [Default is: 5.2]5.2

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]: 

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]:

bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
following https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources gide, I get a lot of warnings while building Tensorflow 1.7 from source. the process is completed anyway and the whl file created.

What (eventually) I'm doing wrong?
First time building Tensorflow from code and first time using Bazel, sorry for the noob question :)
