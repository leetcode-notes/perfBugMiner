Update CUDA/cuDNN in Dockerfiles

Currently, the Dockerfiles are using CUDA 7.5 and cuDNN v4:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/docker/Dockerfile.devel-gpu#L1
Any chance of updating the Dockerfile to cuDNN v5 as a first step? It might be just a single-character fix :) cuDNN v5 is RC but stable AFAIK.
Ideally, it would be also useful for users with Pascal boards to also update to CUDA 8.0 as the next step (we now provide CUDA 8.0 RC on CentOS 7, ubuntu 14.04 and ubuntu 16.04). But I would understand if you prefer to wait until CUDA 8.0 is out of RC.
