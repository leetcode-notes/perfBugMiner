Fix header path of iOS examples for eigen

I failed to build iOS example projects.
It seems download destination path for eigen library is changed
from tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen-latest
to tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh#L49
Fixing Header Search Paths solves the problem.
