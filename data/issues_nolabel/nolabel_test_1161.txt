Trouble importing tensorflow after installing with virtualenv

Environment info
Fedora 19
Python2.7.8
pip 8.0.2
Steps to reproduce

I installed tensorflow from the Download and Setup page using virtualenv.
When I typed "import tensorflow as tf" I got the following error:

">>> import tensorflow
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "/home/emerson/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/init.py", line 23, in 
from tensorflow.python import *
File "/home/emerson/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/init.py", line 69, in 
from tensorflow.python.training import training as train
File "/home/emerson/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/training.py", line 149, in 
from tensorflow.python.training.saver import generate_checkpoint_state_proto
File "/home/emerson/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py", line 29, in 
from google.protobuf.any_pb2 import Any
ImportError: No module named any_pb2"
I have searched for this error and have not seen a clear solution. I am new with linux and tensorflow. I think I might need to set the PYTHONPATH or get out of the working directory that contains tensorflow. However I am not sure how to do either of those things.
Thanks
