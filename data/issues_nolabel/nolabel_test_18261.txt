How to set the truncation time series length parameter for RNN training in this example: tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/timeseries/examples/lstm.py

In the function of tf.contrib.timeseries.ARRegressor, we can set the input_window_size and output_window_size for building a time series forecasting model.
But in this example, we can only set the parameter of num_units of cell and num_features of input data for _LSTMModelï¼Œbut we can not set the parameter of the truncation time series length in this model of TFTS.
