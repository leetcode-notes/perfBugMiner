Error on importing metagraph that uses unbound input multiple times

If I export a scoped metagraph which has multiple references to a tensor which will be unbound after exporting, I cannot re-import the metagraph. This problem can be reproduced with the following MWE.
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()

with graph.as_default():
    inputs = tf.placeholder(shape=[], dtype=tf.float32, name="inputs")

    with tf.name_scope("scope"):
        output = inputs + inputs

    tf.train.export_meta_graph("./mwe.meta",
                               export_scope="scope",
                               as_text=True)

graph = tf.Graph()

with graph.as_default():
    inputs = tf.constant(shape=[], value=1.0)

    tf.train.import_meta_graph("./mwe.meta",
                               import_scope="scope",
                               input_map={
                                   "$unbound_inputs_inputs": inputs
                               })

Running this code results in the following error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<snip>\metagraph_bug_mwe.py", line 23, in <module>
    "$unbound_inputs_inputs": inputs

    **kwargs)

    ",".join([compat.as_str(v) for v in field.value
ValueError: Graph contains unbound inputs: $unbound_inputs_inputs,$unbound_inputs_inputs. Must provide these inputs through input_map.

Upon inspection of the generated metagraph file (see mwe.meta, lines 67 - 75), I noticed that the inputs tensor actually has two entries in the unbound_inputs collection. Since the import_scoped_meta_graph function compares the full collection read from the proto to the input_map parameter, they do not match and the error is raised.
