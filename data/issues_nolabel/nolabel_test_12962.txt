Error building freeze_graph

I am trying to build freeze_graph with bazel like this :
bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:freeze_graph
and I am getting this error :
ERROR: /home/konmon01/tensorflow/tensorflow/BUILD:187:1: //tensorflow:all_files: invalid label ']' in element 2 of attribute 'srcs' in 'filegroup' rule: invalid target name ']': target names may not contain ']'
ERROR: /home/konmon01/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/BUILD:3736:12: Target '//tensorflow:internal' contains an error and its package is in error (this is usually caused by a missing package group in the package-level visibility declaration)

ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/python/tools:freeze_graph' failed; build aborted

I installed bazel from scratch but did not give a solution. Any suggestions on that ??

bazel version

As it turns out I cannot build any script with bazel (????)
