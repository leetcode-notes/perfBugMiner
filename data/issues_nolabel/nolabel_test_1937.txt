Issue
Issue: trying to install TensorFlow from source and have run into a number of issues.

Resolved: Issue reported elsewhere with pulling eigen. Resolved by downloading eigen manually and modifying workspace.bzl to point to local eigen repository.
Unresolved: Error with getting web-animations for bower:

Output

I'm not sure how to fix this - any help at all would be appreciated.
