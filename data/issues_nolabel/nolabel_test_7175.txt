Go: Documentation of default values for attributes of generated ops can be confusing

In the Go documentation of op.MatMulTransposeA it says
"value: If true, "a" is transposed before multiplication. If not specified, defaults to b:false"
which should probably be
"value: If true, "a" is transposed before multiplication. If not specified, defaults to a:false"
I haven't figured out yet where the documentation for the generated Go source code comes from, maybe it is used to generate documentation in other formats as well.
