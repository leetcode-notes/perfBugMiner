Describe the problem
Situation:

We are seeking for a doc2vec implementation based on Tensorflow.
The reason for this is to be "as PaaS as possible" in model training and serving (using Google Cloud ML or AWS Sagemaker).

Complication:

There is no native doc2vec implementation in Tensorflow (word2vec is available)
Stackoverflow does not list too much on this.

Questions/Feature request:

Is a "native" doc2vec implementation planned in Tensorflow?
if not, is there a common implementation to it, e.g. sum up all the individual word vectors and potentially add normalizing to each "doc"?
