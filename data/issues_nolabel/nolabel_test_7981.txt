Fix Inconsistency in the seq2seq documentation.

With TF 1.0, the parameters softmax_loss_function has changed from Function (inputs-batch, labels-batch) to Function (labels-batch, inputs-batch).
The documentation has been updated for sequence_loss_by_example:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/legacy_seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py
    
    
         Line 1063
      in
      a832909
    
    
    
    

        
          
               softmax_loss_function: Function (labels-batch, inputs-batch) -> loss-batch 
        
    
  


But not for sequence_loss and model_with_buckets even if those are calling sequence_loss_by_example internally:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/legacy_seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py
    
    
         Line 1114
      in
      a832909
    
    
    
    

        
          
               softmax_loss_function: Function (inputs-batch, labels-batch) -> loss-batch 
        
    
  


Edit: Here is the commit that made the change but forgot to update the documentation in some places: 24246a1
