Tensorflow model training working slow

I have arond 1500 images  with 7 classes i know its less but i am rookie in machine learning and object detection. Due to technical limitation i am currently training the model  using tensorflow cpu version. the machine is taking 20 second/step. and it took 3 days to reach 11000 steps. i want to reach atleast 40000 steps.  My question is it always take that long time for training the model in tensorflow-cpu or is there some problem? please answer my question as soon as possible
I am using tensorflow-cpu version 1.5 the reason of using this version is that in tensorflow-1.7 i am getting the depracation warning and  was not able to train the model on my laptop
If i am doing something wrong please guide me
thanking you in anticipation
