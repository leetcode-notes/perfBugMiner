Incorrect Command Line in Image Training Tutorial

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d 1.2.0
Python version: 3.5.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: none
Exact command to reproduce:

bazel build tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image && \
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image \
--graph=/tmp/output_graph.pb --labels=/tmp/output_labels.txt \
--output_layer=final_result \
--image=$HOME/flower_photos/daisy/21652746_cc379e0eea_m.jpg

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
The tutorial for image retraining has an incorrect command line, which prevents the label_image classifier from running.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
If you run the command as is, you get the following output:
E tensorflow/examples/label_image/main.cc:349] Running model failed: Not found: FeedInputs: unable to find feed output input
Solution
Please see this StackOverflow post.
The solution is to add the option --input_layer=Mul to the command line. The new command line should read:
bazel build tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image && \
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image \
--graph=/tmp/output_graph.pb --labels=/tmp/output_labels.txt \
--input_layer=Mul \
--output_layer=final_result \
--image=$HOME/flower_photos/daisy/21652746_cc379e0eea_m.jpg
