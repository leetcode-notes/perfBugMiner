DOC modify install_mac and install_linux

Originally in install_mac it says

installing from sources, which is for experts and is documented in a separate guide.

But it didn't say what that separate guide is. I think that is wield, so I added a link to that.
Also, install_linux didn't mention install from source option, so I added one to that too
