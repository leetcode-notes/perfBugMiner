OpenCL isn't working

TF is configured with OpenCL

Please specify which C++ compiler should be used as the host C++ compiler. [Default is ]: /usr/bin/g++
Please specify which C compiler should be used as the host C compiler. [Default is ]: /usr/bin/gcc
Please specify the location where ComputeCpp for SYCL 1.2 is installed. [Default is /usr/local/computecpp]:

ComputeCpp is also present

I also has OpenCL
$ clinfo |grep -i version
  Platform Version:				 OpenCL 2.0 AMD-APP (1912.5)
  Device OpenCL C version:			 OpenCL C 1.2 
  Driver version:				 1912.5 (VM)
  Version:					 OpenCL 1.2 AMD-APP (1912.5)
  Device OpenCL C version:			 OpenCL C 1.2 
  Driver version:				 1912.5 (sse2,avx,fma4)
  Version:					 OpenCL 1.2 AMD-APP (1912.5)

But it seems that TF don't see any OpenCL device in my system.
>>> from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
>>> [x.name for x in device_lib.list_local_devices()]
['/cpu:0']
