Android: Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization: Invalid GraphDef

I have an issue with loading custom model into Android app.
I'm using LinearClassifier and the function export_savedmodel() for saving the model.
It looks like this
model_path = model.export_savedmodel(export_dir_base="model", serving_input_receiver_fn=serving_input_fn)

Then from the path, I'm getting the file saved_model.pb and put it into the assets folder of the Android app. Then I try to load the model
val inferenceInterface = TensorFlowInferenceInterface(assets, "saved_model.pb")

However, at runtime IOException is thrown:
Failed to load model from 'saved_model.pb'
...
Android: Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization: Invalid GraphDef

Does anybody know what can be the issue? Seems like either the model is exported wrong or the issue with the implementation of TensorFlowInferenceInterface. Did somebody have experience loading models in Android app?
