Add Feature: Sparse matrix multiplications for Tensors with rank > 2

This is according to Issue #9210
The cpu implementation now support rank 3, 4, 5.
I have a trouble in the gpu implementation. On current line 113 (old 102):
To32Bit(out).device(d) = To32Bit(out).constant(T(0));
nvcc can compile it without error. But at runtime, it produces
Assertion failed: (cudaGetLastError() == cudaSuccess), function run, file /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/include/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorExecutor.h, line 262. Abort trap: 6
When I try to change it to
To32Bit(out).setZero();
It gives
Bus error: 10
I got the same failure on r1.1 source files.
Any help will be appreciated.
