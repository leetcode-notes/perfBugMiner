Feature request: numeric type promotion

TensorFlow does some numeric type promotion.
It should do more of it.
Examples:
# this works, 2 is int32, gets promoted to float32
tf.pow(2.,2)

# this fails, apply_op promotion logic is not smart enough
tf.pow(2,2.)

# this fails, [2,] is converted to int32 but needs to be int64
tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, [2,])

# this works, numpy arrays are int64 by default
tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, np.array([2,]))

cc @suharshs who changed the default to treat Python integer as int32
