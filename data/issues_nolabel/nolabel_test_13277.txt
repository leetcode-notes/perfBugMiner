Refactoring of canned estimators

Class specific model_fn() used by each canned estimator are replaced by common_model_fn() and common_combined_model_fn() functions and moved to utils.py, together with common classifier_head() and regression_head() functions. Canned estimators are then refactored to use these common functions which simplified their code and increased readability.
