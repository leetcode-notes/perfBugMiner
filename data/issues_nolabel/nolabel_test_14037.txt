Complex matrix_inverse inconsistency error

If I run the following code: https://github.com/nunodsousa/tensorflow_matrix_inversion/blob/master/tf_matrix_inversion.ipynb I obtain the inverse of a complex matrix. However, If I reduce 1E-4 times the values of the matrix, the results should be the same, apart of the 1E4 factor. However it returns similar errors to the one found in #13558.
