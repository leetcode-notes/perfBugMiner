Fix numerical warning of np.float with explicitly specifying np.float32

This PR is to fix numerical warning of type np.float.

WARNING:tensorflow:float64 is not supported by many models, consider casting to float32

The numpy data type np.float is shorthand for np.float64. So, np.float32 is explicitly specified as solution.
