Can anyone install it with cuda7.5 and cudnn 7.0?

I installed it from source code. Everything is OK.
But when I  run '"""bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu""" .
The errors are   1)Unable to load cuBLAS DSO,2)Unable to load cuDNN DSO,3)Unable to load cuFFT DSO,4)Unable to load cuRAND DSO.
