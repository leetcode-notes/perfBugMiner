Add complex64 and complex128 support for `tf.angle` on GPU

In PR #10643, complex64 and complex128 support have been added for tf.angle on CPU. However, because of the compiling errors, the complex support on GPU is not enabled yet.
The issue was that, std::arg is not available on nvidia device for GPU. This fix changes to used atan2 instead, which is available in CUDA.
The relevant test cases have bee enabled.
This fix is related to #10643.
