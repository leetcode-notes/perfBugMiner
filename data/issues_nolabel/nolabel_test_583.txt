Multiple CPU usage ineffective

I'm running tensorflow on a machine with 64 CPUs and no GPUs. I noticed that although tf detects the number of CPU's correctly (
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:40] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 64
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc:58] Direct session inter op parallelism threads: 64
), the total CPU usage is less than 16 most of the time. It increases to 20-30 occasionally but for a very short period of time. And even that is much lower than 64.
