We must also trim everything after TAB, in order to correctly parse version from TensorRT-3.0.2

Note TABS after version numbers:
dmikushin@tesla-cmc:/opt/TensorRT-3.0.2/include$ cat NvInfer.h | grep SONAME
#define NV_TENSORRT_SONAME_MAJOR 4		//!< shared object library major version number
#define NV_TENSORRT_SONAME_MINOR 0		//!< shared object library minor version number
#define NV_TENSORRT_SONAME_PATCH 2		//!< shared object library patch version number

I'm not a Python expert, please feel free to rework this in a better way.
This pull requests fixes the following build error:
Cuda Configuration Error: TensorRT library version detected from /opt/TensorRT-3.0.2/include/NvInfer.h (4		//!<.0		//!<.2	//!<) does not match TF_TENSORRT_VERSION (4.0.2). To fix this rerun configure again.
