Tensorflow is using the wrong cuda toolkit

I recently installed tensorflow on an Ubuntu 12.04 machine that has both cuda 6.5 and 7.0 installed. However, when I import tensorflow I get the following error:
    import tensorflow as tf
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/__init__.py", line 23, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python import *
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/__init__.py", line 49, in <module>
    from tensorflow import contrib
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/__init__.py", line 23, in <module>
    from tensorflow.contrib import layers
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/layers/__init__.py", line 68, in <module>

    from tensorflow.python.framework import versions
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/versions.py", line 22, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python import pywrap_tensorflow
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py", line 28, in <module>
    _pywrap_tensorflow = swig_import_helper()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py", line 24, in swig_import_helper
    _mod = imp.load_module('_pywrap_tensorflow', fp, pathname, description)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/imp.py", line 243, in load_module
    return load_dynamic(name, filename, file)
ImportError: libcudart.so.7.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Am I doing something wrong? Can I use cuda 6.5 or 7.0?
Edit: installation was via pip(3).
