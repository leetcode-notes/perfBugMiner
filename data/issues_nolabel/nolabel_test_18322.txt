Tensorflow 1.7.0 - Illegal instruction

Hy everyone!
I have Illegal instruction with tensorflow (v. 1.7) when I just type the import command:
Python 2.7.14 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 27 2018, 17:29:31)
[GCC 7.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.



import tensorflow as tf
Illegal instruction ( core dumped creato )



Surface the internet for the solution, I found that I can downgrade at 1.5 but I cannot downgrade at 1.5 because I need new attribute that are located in 1.6 and 1.7. (the attribute is tf.contrib.data.shuffle_and_repeat).
How can I fix the problem?
This is my CPU: AMD A4-3300M APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics
It's to old to run tensorflow? Is tensorflow works with new CPU and GPU? My PC is 6-7 years old.
