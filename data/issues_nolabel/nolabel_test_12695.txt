Bundling tensorflow app to desktop

I have got a tensorflow based app which recognizes the objects state. I use opencv and tensorflow to get this done. The final application has to be a desktop app. How do I bundle all dependencies and export it for desktop?
PS: I have asked the same question in stackoverflow with no response for my question hence Im asking this here hoping for a positive reply
