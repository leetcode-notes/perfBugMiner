Python Exceptions lead to CUDA Memory Leak

I've been using hyperopt in it's MondoTrials configuration to do a grid search of my hyperparameters and the process has been slow going since every time my python program crashes for whatever reason, my CUDA memory is not freed
Here is the output i see from nvidia-smi:
