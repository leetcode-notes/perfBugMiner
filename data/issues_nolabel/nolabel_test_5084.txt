[feature request] Defining gradient functions of new Ops using custom python functions

As explained in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/adding_an_op/index.html, the gradient functions for new Ops have to use other tensorflow Ops. This is a big limitation for me. I want to use other python functions to implement the gradient function.
Btw, this is a good answer to define new Ops purely in python, but it still has the limitation that the gradient function has to use other existing tensorflow Ops.
