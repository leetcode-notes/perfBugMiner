Remove Python dep on 'enum'

Python enum is only used by a couple files, and has caused a lot of pain. Maybe we shouldn't use it?
Python enum is used by a couple files in TensorFlow. It's not portable. It was only quite recently backported to Python 2.7. For example, TensorFlow won't compile on Debian 8 without sudo apt-get install python-enum34 however sudo apt-get install python-enum will break the build.
