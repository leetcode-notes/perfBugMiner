Tools for generating the website is not available in this public github repo

Could the website generator tools for tensorflow.org be changed to  open source tools here. It will be good and appreciated!
Many people want to get the offline version of tensorflow documentation, not only the API documentation, I think they can use the  tools to generate the website from markdown files, and  to offline html files. It will be helpful.
And I think if the tool become a open source tool. It will be more useful and powerful.  thanks:)
