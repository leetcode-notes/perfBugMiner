No gradient defined for operation 'ExtractImagePatches'

I tried to  use tf.extract_image_patches to implement a locally layer as #2605 said. However an error occurred:
LookupError: No gradient defined for operation 'local/ExtractImagePatches' (op type: ExtractImagePatches)
I checked that tf.space_to_depth has the gradient definition but tf.extract_image_patches does not. And it seems not easy for me to implement the gradient. Any advice?
