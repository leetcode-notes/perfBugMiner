google/protobuf/any.proto: File not found

Environment info
Operating System: ubuntu14.04
I have install java8 and the latest version of bazel ([bazel release 0.3.0-2016-07-21 (@2e1dbd7)]) pulled from github. After then, I pulled the tensorflow.igt using the command: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.
Then, I intended to install tensorflow following the steps:

Install java8.
Install bazel ([bazel release 0.3.0-2016-07-21 (@2e1dbd7)])  pulled from github.
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.
./configure (in the root dir of tensorflow, without using google cloud, without configuration of gpu)
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Unfortunately, error prompted in Step 5:
".. tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD:23:1: error loading package 'tensorflow/core': Encountered error while reading extension file 'protobuf.bzl': no such package '@protobuf//': Error cloning repository: https://github.com/google/protobuf: cannot open git-upload-pack caused by https://github.com/google/protobuf: cannot open git-upload-pack caused by sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target caused by PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target caused by unable to find valid certification path to requested target and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package'.

I have confirmed that git clone can be used normally to pull the code from https://github.com/google/protobuf.
Anyone knows how this problem can be fixed ?
