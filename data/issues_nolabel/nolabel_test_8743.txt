Issue when installing from source

Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
gcc version: 5.3.0

I've installed CUDA and cuDNN correctly, and I'm trying to install TF from source. After performing the configure, when running the command:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
an error shows that:
INFO: From Compiling external/nccl_archive/src/libwrap.cu.cc: gcc: error trying to exec 'as': execvp: No such file or directory

It seems that there's something wrong with my gcc. However, I've reinstalled it and the error still occurs.
I wanna know if it is the issue of cross-platform options.
