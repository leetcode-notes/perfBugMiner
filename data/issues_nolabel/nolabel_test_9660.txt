Fix error of version_info.cc not being generated on windows

If tensorflow_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS is disabled in CMake, the Python interpreter is never resolved in CMake, but it is needed in tf_core_framework.cmake for generating the version_info.cc file with the script tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py. This seems to only be a problem on windows, resulting in a failed build complaining about version_info.cc missing. This is not an issue on linux, probably because of the shebang #!/usr/bin/env python in the script.
I suggest moving the part in tf_python.cmake that sets up the python interpreter to the CMakeLists.txt as done in this PR so that it is always executed.
