tensorflow `resize_image_with_crop_or_pad` for whole batch

Currently there exists tensorflow.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad() that works well, but for me it would be very beneficial to have also something that would be able to perform crop on whole batch of images or even conv2d or conv2d_transpose outputs.
In other words it should work on Tensor of shape [batch, height, width, channels].
So far I have found this mentioned here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33944683/tensorflow-map-operation-for-tensor
And for now I'd probably go with the tf.while_loop, but general built in function in tensorflow would be helpful.
