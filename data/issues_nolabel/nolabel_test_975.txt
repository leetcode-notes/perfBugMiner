the time about gpu

I have installed the gpu version tf. I'm running a cnn with input size 256_256 and epoch size 32_32, but the speed is very slow,  gpu is 980ti

the first time running the speed is fast, but after this the speed is slow. What's the reason?
How could I identify the program is running on a gpu or cpu?
