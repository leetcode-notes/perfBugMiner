tensorflow-gpu on mac

I can use the following to install tensorflow on mac.
Python 2
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.4.0-py2-none-any.whl

Python 3
pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.4.0-py3-none-any.whl

But I don't find the correponding files for tensorflow-gpu. Can it be generated and posted over there? Thanks.
