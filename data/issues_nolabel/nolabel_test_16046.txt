Feature Request: clarify supported environments for official binaries.

As it stands now, binary release of TensorFlow 1.5 is set to drop compatibility with Ubuntu 14.04 ( #15777), and compatibility with Debian Linux distros, such as Amazon Linux AMI (ImportError: /lib64/libm.so.6: versionGLIBC_2.23' not found`).
To avoid surprise, TensorFlow should either:

Follow other open-source projects like Ray/PyTorch and provide official binaries for these systems
or
Document that support is dropped, to encourage other players (ie, AWS) to take over the job of providing these binaries
