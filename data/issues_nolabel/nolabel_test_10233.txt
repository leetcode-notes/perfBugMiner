Tensorboard does not support multiple google cloud directory as logdir

I would like to launch tensorboard with
tensorboard --logdir gs://path1,gs://path2

or even better
 tensorboard --logdir model1:gs://path/1,model2:gs://path/2

but this is not currently supported.
It should be an easy addition and I can provide a patch if it make sense.
