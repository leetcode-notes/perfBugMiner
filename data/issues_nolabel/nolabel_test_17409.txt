TensorRT support for ARM architectures

i.e. without this modification Tensorflow under Nvidia Jetpack 3.2 is not compiling. Else condition in if-then-else block generates a path "%s/../include" which results in "/usr/lib/include" but it must be "/usr/include/aarch64-linux-gnu"... So this fix targets ARM architectures and with this fix, Tensorflow 1.6rc compiles fine with TensorRT support.
