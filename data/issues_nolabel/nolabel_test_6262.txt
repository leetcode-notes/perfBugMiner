CMake Build Error for Computing Capability 2.1

Thanks a lot guys for giving support to windows ðŸ’¯
But since I'm having an old GPU(Nvidia 610M) with computing capabilty 2.1 I'm unable to use GPU. Is it possible to run Tensorflow on this GPU???
For trying my luck, I followed instructions from this comment and this cmake instruction but I'm running into build errors.
Environment : Windows 10 Pro 1607 64 Bit & Nvidia 610M with Python 3.5, Visual Studio 2015, CUDA 8
I got build error on both MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj and MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release tf_tutorials_example_trainer.vcxproj
Please help me in compiling for this GPU or it would be great if someone could share the whl.
Thank you
