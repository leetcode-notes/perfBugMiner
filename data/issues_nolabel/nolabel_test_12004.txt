Where does "unknown error" message come from ?

Hi,
While doing my training of a faster-rcnn model, I get an "unknown error" message but the training seems to work fine.
I just want to know where in Tensorflow's source code there is a "print('unknown error')" ? I don't seem to find that anywhere.
Thanks you guys,
