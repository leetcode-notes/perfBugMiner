Logistic regression weights: Using a `tf.Tensor` as a Python `bool` is not allowed

Trying to use logistic_regression weights led me to the exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: Using a `tf.Tensor` as a Python `bool` is not allowed. Use `if t is not None:` instead of `if t:` to test if a tensor is defined, and use the logical TensorFlow ops to test the value of a tensor.

which is fixed by attached change.
