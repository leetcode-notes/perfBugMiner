Exact command to reproduce: Compilation with the following command fails:


bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
ERROR: /root/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/verbs/BUILD:133:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/contrib/verbs:rdma' failed (Exit 1).

compilation terminated.
The ./configure is done with all the defaults except enabling verbs.
Reverting the following commit fixes compilation:

Move GPU-specific dependencies of core/grappler:devices into
cuda_deps.

Fix #includes and deps of contrib/verbs:verbs_util, in particular
removing an unnecessary #include of gpu_util.h that relied on a
transitive dependency through :devices.
