TPU support

I wanna add support for my Tensor Processing Unit chip in TensorFlow.
My TPU is implemented as an accelerator for ARM v7 32bit processor and implements multiple arithmetic kernels, similar to GPU. It implements a simple memory mapped interface, SGDMA and vector instructions over tensors. I added vector extension to GCC 7.1.1 and can run bare metal C++ nets on embedded Ubuntu 16.04
I also checked the TF port  for Raspberry Pi 3, but it looks outdated and barely supported.
I'm not currently aware about the scope of work, but believe that should not be that complex, given open examples from GPU vendors and already existing port for Google TPU
Anyone interested in joining this project is highly welcome! Advise, links and code examples are much appreciated
Thank you
