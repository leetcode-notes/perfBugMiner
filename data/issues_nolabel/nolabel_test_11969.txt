tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0rc1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

I am trying to install TF 1.3.0rc1 in CentOS 7.3 with Nvidia GPUs for python3.6. When I installed with python2.7, it was fine.
sudo pip3.6 install -U http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0rc1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
I get this error with python3.6
My pip3.6 has a slight difference with sudo
Without sudo, when I run pip3.6 --version, I get

pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)

With sudo I get

pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)

Any workaround for this?
