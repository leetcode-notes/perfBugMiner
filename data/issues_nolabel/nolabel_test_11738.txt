Using VSCode to import tensorflow failed

I've installed tensorflow on Windows 10 successfully.But I can only run tensorflow under terminal command .What I want to do is to write python script on VSCode. It turns out some configuration may be done for VSCode.So Is there anyone who can solve this?Thanks a lot.
