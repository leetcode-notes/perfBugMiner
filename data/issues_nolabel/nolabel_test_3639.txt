TensorFlow master build failing:  error: 'Packet4f' does not name a type

I am trying to build TensorFlow master on big endian architecture and I am facing build issues related to EIGEN_VECTORIZE_SSE2 as mentioned below:
In file included from tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.cc:20:0:
./tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.h:46:26: error: 'Packet4f' does not name a type
 EIGEN_DEVICE_FUNC inline Packet4f pexpand_bf16_l(const Packet4f& from) {

./tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.h:59:26: error: 'Packet4f' does not name a type
 EIGEN_DEVICE_FUNC inline Packet4f pexpand_bf16_u(const Packet4f& from) {

./tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.h:117:21: error: 'Packet4f' does not name a type
 EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE Packet4f pload4bf16<Packet4f>(const float* from) {

./tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.h:128:21: error: 'Packet4f' does not name a type
 EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE Packet4f pload2bf16<Packet4f>(const float* from) {


Looks like this issue is caused due to a recent commit fix build for PPC
This commit includes fix for PPC however its breaking build for other non SSE platform.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu/Red Hat
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: Not installed
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".  master
If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)   98d63de
The output of bazel version  0.3.0

Steps to reproduce

bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

What have you tried?

Could build tensorflow master by removing condition for #ifndef EIGEN_VECTORIZE_SSE2 from tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.h file.
