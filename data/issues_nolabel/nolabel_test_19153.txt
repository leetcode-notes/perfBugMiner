Remove python defines which clash with logging

I have the following clang on OS/X (High Sierra 10.13.4):
Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.5.0
Thread model: posix

I receive a set of errors while compiling the contrib/lite directory which comes down to python defining some of the standard isXXX type functions with pre-processor macros.
This change removes those errors by undefining them
