A way to get the last non-zero output of a variable-length RNN

Feature request: The sequence_length parameter in rnn.rnn() is a convenient way to support variable length sequences. The great thing about it is that it propagates the state at an example's sequence length to the final state output. However, it doesn't similarly propagate the output at an example's sequence length. This is the feature being requested here.
If one is interested in the last output only, reading outputs[-1] returns zeros for all the examples that are shorter than the max sequence length. It would simplify things considerably if there was a way to get the output value at the example's sequence length.
