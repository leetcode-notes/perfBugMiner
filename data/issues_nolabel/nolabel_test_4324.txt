can't find module tensorflow after building 'quantize_graph'

Hi,
I followed this blog post in order build the tool for quantizing graph (tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph).
I had a clean working version of tensorflow installed properly.
I used this command in order to build the quantization tool :
bazel build tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph
It seems that the build went ok :
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph up-to-date:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph
INFO: Elapsed time: 20.105s, Critical Path: 16.60s
However after that finished when i open python and try to import tensorflow i get an error message :
ImportError: No module named tensorflow
