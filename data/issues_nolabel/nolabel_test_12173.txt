[OpenCL] Fixes double memcpy bug (#151)

As the debg CopyOp is called on a Tensor without type, we need to use
the DataType enum to get type information, and use this to pass the type
on to Eigen. This is a workaround Eigen's need to have a type when
calling memcpy. If the Eigen memcpy can be provided without a type
requirement, then the memcpy in sycl_util is unnecessary.
