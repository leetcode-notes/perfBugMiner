Unable to use Tensorflow on Android Studio

I have opened the Android part into android studio from examples/contrib/Android and the project opened.
After that I added the pre compiled jar file libandroid_tensorflow_inference_java from the nightly mode added it as module then added module dependency from the project structure .
After that I get error on bazel location. I have also build bazel-0.40 at the following path def bazel_location = 'C:\Users\ANMOL\Downloads\bazel-0.4.0\bazel-0.4.0\output\bazel.exe' and when I copy this path into Android Studio it doesnt seem to work .
Any Ideas how to make it work
