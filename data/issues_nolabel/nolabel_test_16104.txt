Feature request: Allow the build to use the system-installed protobuf lib

Describe the problem
Currently, it's impossible to use the system-installed protobuf library because the tensorflow build always uses the protobuf_archive version. There should be an option to use the one installed in the system.
Background: I package tensorflow for Arch Linux and we run into symbol conflicts if a user wants to use protobuf and tensorflow together in a binary because tensorflow's protobuf symbols conflict with the one installed in the system already.
