C++ gradients: Fractional*Pool, Soft{Plus,Sign}

I also ran the newly added tests multiple times to check for flakes, seems ok.
$ bazel test --runs_per_test=1000 tensorflow/cc:gradients_nn_grad_test
...
//tensorflow/cc:gradients_nn_grad_test                                   PASSED in 0.5s
  Stats over 1000 runs: max = 0.5s, min = 0.3s, avg = 0.4s, dev = 0.0s

Resolves #17330
