Different models for training and testing

# choose RNN/GRU/LSTM cell
        self.cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(self.memory_dim)

        # embedding model
        if not self.attention:
            self.dec_outputs, self.dec_memory = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length)
            self.dec_outputs_tst, _ = seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq(\
                            self.enc_inp, self.dec_inp, self.cell, \
                            self.vocab_size, self.vocab_size, self.seq_length, feed_previous=True)

I want to have feed_previous = False for the Training (self.dec_outputs), while feed_previous=True for Testing(self.dec_output_tst). This is the reasonable case, in any seq2seq translation model.
However, when I try to run it I get following error. This is exactly not a bug, but there is absolutely no source of information on this
The error is as follows:

ValueError: Variable embedding_rnn_seq2seq/RNN/EmbeddingWrapper/embedding already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope? Originally defined at:

Now I know that I have to use variable scoping, but exactly where is the question. I apologize if I have missed on something
