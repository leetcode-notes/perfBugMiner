Changes to pip.sh; adding docker_test.sh

Breaking pip.sh into the install step (pip.sh) and the test step
(newly added test_installation.sh)

pip.sh now performs only the building and install of the pip package,
with the install happening inside virtualenv. (vritualenv address the
reinstallation issue on Mac pip tests). Then it calls
test_installation.sh and test_tutorials.sh to test the virtualenv pip
install of TensorFlow.

Adding a new file, docker_test.sh, as a first step toward automation
of TensorFlow docker image build and test process.

This script builds and tests docker images with TensorFlow pip whl
installed. The tests include the Python unit tests and tutorial tests
against the (non-virtualenv) install. This is not fully functional yet, because
we need to further automate the pip package uploading process, so the
Dockerfiles in tensorflow/tools/docker can point to the latest pip
files.
