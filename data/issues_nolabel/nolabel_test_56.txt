pip error: No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-...-build/setup.py'

I'm getting the following error when trying to install on a GPU desktop using pip as described in the tensorflow setup page:
$ sudo pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

See this Stackoverflow page that discusses the problem and indicates that a setup.py file is missing in the package.
