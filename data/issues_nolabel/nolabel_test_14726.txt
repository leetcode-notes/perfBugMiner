Make a copy of a model

Hi,  is there a canonical method in Tensorflow for this? For example, in Keras, we can use keras.models.clone_model for this purpose.  I though that model's copy would be such a nice feature, since copy.deepcopy does not work for me in Tensorflow.
I want to copy weights from this model to another model of identical structure,  and I do not want to save a model then restore it to another instance for this situation. Specifically, the situation at every iteration we train model1 then make model2 as a copy of current model1, adding noise to model1 parameters and sample from model2 and then use these samples to update model1.
Class Model1(object):
    def method1(self):
        ....
    def method2(self):
        ....
