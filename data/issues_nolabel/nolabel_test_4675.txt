LinearClassifier feature_columns overwritten in LinearClassifier.fit

tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.linear.LinearClassifier.fit
effectively returns
tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator.fit
Estimator.fit calls:
tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator._train_model
which has these lines:
      features, targets = input_fn()
      self._check_inputs(features, targets)
      train_op, loss_op = self._get_train_ops(features, targets)

tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator._check_inputs
    if self._features_info is not None:
      ...
    else:
      self._features_info = tensor_signature.create_signatures(features)

So we get to a point where features, as derived from the input_fn, is treated as our feature columns set.
In pseudo code:
def input_function()
    return [foo, bar, baz], quux

lc=LinearClassifier(feature_columns=[foo]) # We pass in what we want our feature column to be
lc.fit(input_function) # run fit on out input function
lc._feature_columns # repr _feature_columns on the instantiated classifier
    [foo]
lc.estimator._features_info # _features_info on the instantiated classifiers instantiated estimator
    [foo, bar, baz]

The issue is:
Although this line appears to indicate that we will be making an estimation based on the feature columns supplied:
lc=LinearClassifier(feature_columns=[foo]) # We pass in what we want our feature column to be
What happens is that the passed in feature_columns is unused and instead the return from the input_function supplied to fit are used.
Am I correct in thinking that if the feature_columns arg is supplied that only those columns should be used by the classifiers estimator?
That when we instantiate the classifier we are setting the feature_columns we expect to be used?
The work around for this is simply to only return the columns you need from your input function however I found this misleading.
Point in the tutorial:
Either the code or the tutorial need to be changed.
