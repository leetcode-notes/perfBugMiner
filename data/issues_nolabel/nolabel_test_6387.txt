Sparsemax

The sparsemax op is an alternative to the softmax op, that allows the
output to be sparse (zero properbility) while stil sharing many
mathematical properties with softmax.
The cross entropy loss doesn't work with sparsemax as log(0) is not
defined, thus there is also a sparsemax loss function. This loss
function have a gradient equivalent to that of cross entropy when
using softmax.

I had some issues with getting the numerical precision good enough for assertAllCloseAccordingToType. subtracting mean(logits) helped a bit but not enough, thus I have expanded the assert method such that the tolerance can be specified.
