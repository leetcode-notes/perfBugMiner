error when import tensorflow:ImportError: libcudnn.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

jcc@jcc:~$ pip show tensorflow
Name: tensorflow
Version: 1.0.0rc2
Summary: TensorFlow helps the tensors flow
Home-page: http://tensorflow.org/
Author: Google Inc.

Location: /home/jcc/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Requires: werkzeug, six, wheel, mock, numpy, protobuf
I think the lines above has shown that I have installed the tensorflow using anaconda2(I installed tensorflow by building from source). I have not created a conda virtual environment.
Any help?Why this error? I make sure that in bashrc file I have this line:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jcc/cudnn/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and in the ./configure  process of tensorflow I typed in "/home/jcc/cudnn" for cudnn_path
My server is Ubuntu 14.04, titan x gpu, cuda7.5 ,cudnn5
The last command line of my build history is like:
pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
Processing /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
