Describe the problem
I would like to enable and disable tfdbg while running my python code.  At the moment, every time a sess.run() is encountered I get to the tfdbg> prompt.
I am able to run tfdbg by wrapping my session:
sess = tf_debug.LocalCLIDebugWrapperSession(sess)

This works fine.  However, I'm performing an optimization.  I'd like to, on occasion, enter tfdbg.  But mostly, I don't want to.  It appears like its an either/or proposition at the moment.  I could work-around but would rather have a way to stop or start.  An implementation detail is that I've captured <ctrl>-C which allows me to make changes to the running optimization.  There I would enable or disable tfdbg such that the next time a sess.run() is hit, tfdbg works as requested.
I apologize in advance if there is already a way to do this.  I couldn't find it if its there.
