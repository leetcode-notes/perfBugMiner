ps job in the distributed inception trainer killed by OOM killer

Hi all:
It seems that the distributed runtime has a memory leak problem, my tf version is the 0.8.0 wheel package from http://tensorflow.org.
When I started the distributed inception trainer in http://github.com/tensorflow/models/ on a 64G RAM Linux server with 1 ps and 4 replicas, the footprint of the ps process increased slowly but continously, and the process was finally killed by the system oom killer after several days.
Anyone can reproduce this? @mrry
