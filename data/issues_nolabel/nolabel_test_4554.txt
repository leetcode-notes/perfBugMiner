TensorFlow Binary Segmentation

I've written the following segmentor and I can't get the accuracy to work. In fact I'm always getting accuracy of 0.0 whatever the size of my sample.
I think the problem is at the sigmoid layer at the end of U() function where a tensor of continuous elements between 0 and 1 (conv10) is further compared to a binary tensor and therefore there's no chance of getting any equality between the two.
