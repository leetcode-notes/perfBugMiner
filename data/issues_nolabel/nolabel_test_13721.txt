Update documentation for uint16 support in `tf.resize_...` ops

This fix tries to address the different between the registered kernels and the documentation differnet for uint16 support of:
tf.resize_area
tf.resize_bicubic
tf.resize_bilinear
tf.resize_nearest_neighbor
Though uint16 is supported in the kernel, it is not documented in image_ops.cc. Unit test cases are also missing for uint16 and float16.
This fix added the missing entries in tests and docs.
