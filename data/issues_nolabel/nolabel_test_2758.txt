Steps to reproduce

Install a Flask app along this tutorial: http://www.datasciencebytes.com/bytes/2015/02/24/running-a-flask-app-on-aws-ec2/
Install an image classification web app along this tutorial, but using tensorflow instead of caffe: https://clearsite.io/blog/2016/01/24/using-caffe-in-a-flask-application/
