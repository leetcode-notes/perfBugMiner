solve a serious bug which cause you fail to build

last day's update on third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc made me failed to build tensorflow.
The error is as follow:
ERROR: /home/wenjian/pkgs/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:985:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/core:gpu_runtime' failed: crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc failed: error executing command third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' -fstack-protector -fPIE -Wall -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object ...

I found the GCC_HOST_COMPILER_PATH is defined behind where it is used. This is the reason why it can't work.
I moved it before the usage and configure again, the problem solved.
