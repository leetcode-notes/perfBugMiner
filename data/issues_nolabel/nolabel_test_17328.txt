Feature Request: Training on device

Hi Tensorflow,
I would like to know whether Tensorflow does support on-device training i.e creation of model on Android device. Right now Tensorflow provides Python script to generate model in the Native system and only inference we can execute on Android device. Obviously i cannot execute the Python to create the model in Android, does Tensorflow provides any Example/Feature in C++ to train the model on-device (Android)  ?
Feature Request


A Standalone C++ Application which can be cross compiled for Android to train the model from dataset.


Training the model might be time consuming process if done on Android, but at least some minimal support for smaller data set would be helpful.

Senthil
