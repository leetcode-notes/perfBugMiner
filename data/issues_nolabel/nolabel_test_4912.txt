"no module named tensorflow" when I "import tensorflow" after I install tensorflow on windows successfully

I followed ..\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\README to install tensorflow on windows. Everything went well and I installed tensorflow successfully. But after I "activate tensorflow", and tried to "import tensorflow" using python, it went wrong, saying "no module named tensorflow". How can I fix this problem? Many thanks!
