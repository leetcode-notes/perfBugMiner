pip install version 0.7.1 from source: No module named google.protobuf

Hello,
I have an issue with Google Protobuf. Even after the install Python does not find the module "google.protobuf".
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Python: 2.7.6
Bazel: 0.2.0
Cuda: 7.5
CudNN: 4
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: 1e47e2f
Steps to reproduce

bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
PYTHONUSERBASE=/usr/local/python pip install --user /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.7.1-py2-none-any.whl

Output for pip install:

Error in Python interpreter:
Python 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import google.protobuf
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named google.protobuf
>>>

In the Python prompt, when I run help('modules'), I can see the module tensorflow but not the module google.
The first thing I tried is:

pip uninstall protobuf
PYTHONUSERBASE=/usr/local/python pip install --user --upgrade /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-any.whl

Output:
Installing collected packages: tensorflow, protobuf
Successfully installed tensorflow protobuf
Cleaning up...

Same result, no Protobuf module found.
The second thing I tried is:

pip uninstall protobuf
pip uninstall tensorflow
PYTHONUSERBASE=/usr/local/python pip install --user /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.7.1-py2-none-any.whl

Output:

Successfully installed tensorflow protobuf
Cleaning up...

Same result again, not Protobuf module found.
Any idea of why Protobuf is properly installed but not recognized by Python whereas Tensorflow is propertly recognized by Python?
Thanks for any help that you can provide.
