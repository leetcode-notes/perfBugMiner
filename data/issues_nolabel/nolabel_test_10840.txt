Update sample_distorted_bounding_box to use Tensor Input for min_object_covered

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #10715 where it was not possible
to use dynamic values for min_object_covered in sample_distorted_bounding_box.
This fix created an Op of SampleDistortedBoundingBoxV2 so that min_object_covered
takes input. SampleDistortedBoundingBox remains the same (min_object_covered as attr).
Additional test cases have been added.
