Conversion to int64 for output_buffer_size

Add conversion to int64 when output_buffer_size is initialized with num_threads (of type int32).
The following snippet will output an error Input 'output_buffer_size' of 'ParallelMapDataset' Op has type int32 that does not match expected type of int64 when num_threads is initialized but not output_buffer_size.
dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.range(10)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x+1, num_threads=2)
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
This is because in this case, output_buffer_size is initialized with num_threads of type tf.int32 without any conversion to tf.int64.
