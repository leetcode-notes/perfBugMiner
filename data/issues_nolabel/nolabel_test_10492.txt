Read images with various sizes from TFRecord

I posted this issue in StackOverflow and I got a response as well. However the replied answer would raise a ValueError: All shapes must be fully defined .
I'm just wondering might it be a limitation or even a bug that it's impossible to read images with various sizes from TFRecord?
