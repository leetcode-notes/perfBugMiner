Gradients of Gradients throws 'NAN' outputs for LSTM's

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
Cuda 8.0, tensorflow 1.0
If you try to take the gradient of a gradient such as needed in Improved Techniques of Wasserstien GAN's (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) for LSTMs in the generator, throws a NAN error. If you use convolutions, then there is no error.
