Out-of-source builds

The build instructions have us run bazel such that all the build artifacts are dumped right in the source directory. So are we stuck creating a bunch of .gitignore rules? Seems barbaric when the usual approach is to avoid polluting source directory with build artifacts in the first place.
On behalf of all of us who don't know anything about bazel, I'll ask: does it not support out-of-source builds? I spent some time looking, and trying to do a bazel build from somewhere other than the source directory, and haven't had any luck.
