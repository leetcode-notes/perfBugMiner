Fix strides format for data format in contrib.layers.separable convolution2d

Addresses feature request from issue #10432. Continuation of feature implementation--initial changes did not address the case where num_outputs = None, in which case strides and the input channels must be reformulated according to data format. The previous commit is  rmlarsen@d52e15a.
I created a previous PR #12120 for a similar issue that @rmlarsen fixed in the above commit, but the strides were still mismatched to data format--I thought it would be cleaner if I just made a new PR.
Edit--I thought it would be cleaner because my CLA would be recognized, but it still hasn't. See the comment below.
