Error while creating quantized graph using bazel tool

Hi,
I am trying to quantize the already stripped and retrained inception graph using the following bazel commands, also I am using docker environment in ubuntu 16.10:
bazel build tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph
bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph \
--input=/face_tf_train/new_retrained_graph.pb 
--output_node_names=final_result 
--output=/face_tf_train/new_stripped_quantized_graph.pb 
--mode=eightbit
I am bit new in python and tensorflow, I am not sure what is happening. I want to use the quantized graph for ios mobile app which I am able to compile and run.
Any help could be very much appriciated.
I am getting folowing error in the command promt :
