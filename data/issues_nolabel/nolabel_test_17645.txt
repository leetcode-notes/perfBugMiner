r1.6 broken link to nasm package in workspace.bzl

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I had an issue when trying to build due to the broken nasm link in tensorflow/workspace.bzl.
I was trying to build tensorflow from source (Ubuntu 16.04, x64). I checked out r1.6.  I am following all of the instructions in the install guide. Everything  seems to work fine. Once bazel is installed and I run the build command and I receive a error
no such package '@nasm//': java.io.IOException: Error downloading [https://mirror.bazel.build/www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.12.02/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2, http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/nasm/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2/d15843c3fb7db39af80571ee27ec6fad/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2]

The build is unable to continue at this point. I've run it multiple  times, all with the same error. I've found that this is because there is  only one working mirror link for the nasm package inside of the bazel  config.
I can confirm that link http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/nasm/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2/d15843c3fb7db39af80571ee27ec6fad/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2 is dead (403 response). Adding another mirror such as "http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.12.02/nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2"  to tensorflow/workspace.bzl allowed the build to continue This is all done on the r1.6 branch
Note this is a duplicate of #16862
In order to repro just try to build tensorflow from source using the instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources while working on the r1.6 branch.
