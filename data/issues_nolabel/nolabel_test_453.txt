Change needed in index

The url to mnist.py here is https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist.py which works.
However, at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/mnist/tf/index.html which I believe is the compiled version of this file, the url reads
https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/mnist.py which leads nowhere. I'm not sure exactly where this mistake is, but it should definitely be fixed because otherwise people can't follow along with the tensorflow mechanics tutorial.
