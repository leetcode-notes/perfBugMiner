BasicLSTMCell zero_state() raise error in TF1.2 but works in TF1.1

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
When I try to create zero state tensor for a BasicLSTMCell, a error is raised as below. The same code can work in tensorflow 1.1
