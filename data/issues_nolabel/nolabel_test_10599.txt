Pretrain NLP embeddings

I found a lot of pretrain CNN models in tf.contrib.keras.applications. Nevertheless, for NLP researchers there is no even well-know GoogleNews word2vec vectors or Glove, or...something.
Is it possible to add functionality for simplified embedding download and future usage? Some official maybe_download_google_news_w2v or something like that.
