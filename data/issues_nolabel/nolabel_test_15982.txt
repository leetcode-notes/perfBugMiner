Add broadcasting support for `tf.where`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #9284 where there was no broadcasting support for tf.where. This fix adds the support of broadcasting by adding a broadcast arg in tf.where. When broadcast=True then tf.where matches np.where in behavior. When broadcast=False the old behavior of tf.where are kept.
This fix fixes #9284.
