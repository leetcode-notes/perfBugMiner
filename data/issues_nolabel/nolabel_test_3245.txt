The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

0.9.0

Steps to reproduce


I used the code in tf.contrib.learn.QuickStart


change
# Fit model.
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=200)

to
# Fit model.
for i in range(40):
  classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=5)



The result accuracy is around 0.33, which is similar to call fit with steps=5 only once.
