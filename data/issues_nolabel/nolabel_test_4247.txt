Which TensorFlow-Slim is the "real" one?

I have found 3 TensorFlow-Slim in repo tensorflow/tensorflow and tensorflow/model

(tensorflow/tensorflow) tensorflow.contrib.slim
(tensorflow/model) model.slim
(tensorflow/model) model.inception.inception.slim

Among these places, there are some duplicated codes.
e.g.

(tensorflow/tensorflow) tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets/overfeat.py
(tensorflow/model) slim/nets/overfeat.py

Question:

What are these 3 slim packages used for? What's the differences?
In the future, which one may be deprecated? Or which one will be the future.
