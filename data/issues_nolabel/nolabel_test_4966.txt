Android example giving wrong results on Samsung Galaxy A3

I've built the android demo and installed the same APK on 3 phones: Samsung S6, HTC one M9, and Samsung Galaxy A3.
On the Galaxy A3 only the results are wrong; whereas the other phones give sensible results for various things in the office (photocopier, monitor, laptop etc) the A3 produces much lower scores and suggests things like oscillascope and nematode.
Additionally, the preview window is small and skewed. Suspecting an odd resolution might have confused things, I forced it to 640*480 but the problem persists.
I do not know whether this is unique to the A3 .
