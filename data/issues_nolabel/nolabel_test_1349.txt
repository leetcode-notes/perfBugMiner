Question about back propagation in time-delayed recurrent models

The full question is available here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35733302/back-propagation-in-tensorflow
The question concerns whether I would have to implement a custom backward step in order to create something similar to the clockwork model. In the event that I would, I was wondering if there is reference code for how I might properly go about it.
Thank you in advance for your support.
