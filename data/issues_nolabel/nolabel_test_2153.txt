Optimisations do not seem to be active during building

When building Tensorflow with Bazel master following the instructions in #2109 , I get many warnings like:
In file included from third_party/gpus/cuda/include/host_config.h:161:0,
                 from third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuda_runtime.h:76,
                 from <command-line>:0:
/usr/include/features.h:328:4: warning: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Wcpp]
 #  warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O)
    ^

In fact, running a simple network on TF built by me and linked against Cudnn 5  is10% slower than the wheel built by Google against the default Cudnn.
