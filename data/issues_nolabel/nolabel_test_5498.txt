Change HTTP source locations away from Sourceforge

Problem
There are a bunch of sources downloaded over HTTP during the build process that depend on Sourceforge (libjpeg, giflib, boost, etc.). Unfortunately, Sourceforge presents a download delay at download initiation time, often suffers timeouts, and the download speeds are really slow. This significantly impacts build times.
Solution
The sources could migrate to a subproject under the TensorFlow Github org, or to another Github repo that could host them, or to a CDN. Whatever the solution may be, this could help prevent timeouts and significantly improve the build speeds.
Note: I could issue a PR but the question is what location for these sources the TensorFlow team would find acceptable as an alternative to SourceForge.
