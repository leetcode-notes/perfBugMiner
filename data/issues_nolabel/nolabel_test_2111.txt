Two versions of Grid LSTM cells

I noticed that there are two distinct versions of Grid RNN and LSTM cells in contrib:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/grid_rnn/python/ops/grid_rnn_cell.py
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/ops/rnn_cell.py
I realize that the RNN interface is still in flux, but I was wondering if these will be harmonized at some point?
