the files of events.out.tfevnts.***.net while running deep learning model

Hi
During running a tensorflow model, I found that it automatically generates the file as the follows
events.out.tfevents.1524681518.xhl.net
events.out.tfevents.1524681541.xhl.net



What do these files stand for? Are there any ways to stop generating them. The files are saved along with model checkpoint file.
