`easy_install tensorflow-gpu` fails

A pip install of tensorflow-gpu and tensorflow works great.
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu
However, when one is trying to create a package with a dependency on tensorflow, one usually has to do the following in setup.py:
from setuptools import setup

setup(name='mypkg',
    setup_requires=["tensorflow-gpu == 0.12.0", ...],
    install_requires=["tensorflow-gpu == 0.12.0", ...],
)
Unfortunately, using the above as dependencies fail because setuptools defers to easy_install rather than pip.

If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed: N/A
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". 0.12.0

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD): N/A
The output of bazel version: N/A
