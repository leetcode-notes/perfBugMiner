event_accumulator is missing in v1.1

System information

TensorFlow version: v1.1

Describe the problem
Before v1.1, there is a class called EventAccumulater in python/summary/event_accumulator.py which is used to export the data from tensorboard. However, in v1.1 this file is missing and the README.md is still the old version, saying "If you wish to load TensorFlow events, you should use an EventAccumulator (to load from a single events file) or an EventMultiplexer (to load from multiple events files)".
Is there any alternative API to load the data from tensorboard record files?
