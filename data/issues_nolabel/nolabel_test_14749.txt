Feature Request : Hierarchical Softmax implementation using Tensorflow

I am trying to multi-level classify with Hierarchical Softmax by using Tensorflow. But I could find any existing HS implementation in Tensorflow.
Is there any other way to implement HS using tensorflow?
It would be helpful if Hierarchical Softmax support is given in TF.
