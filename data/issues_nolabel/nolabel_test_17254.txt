DeprecationWarning: The binary mode of fromstring is deprecated, as it behaves surprisingly on unicode inputs. Use frombuffer instead 1.6rc0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Ubuntu 16.04
Tensorflow installed from source, latest HEAD from master (CPU)
1.6rc0
Python 3.5.2
Bazel 0.10.1
gcc-5

Describe the problem
When using tensorflow, I got hundred of DeprecationWarnings: This message exactly

/home/jerome/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py:560: DeprecationWarning: The binary mode of fromstring is deprecated, as it behaves surprisingly on unicode inputs. Use frombuffer instead
return np.fromstring(tensor.tensor_content, dtype=dtype).reshape(shape)

EDIT : fixed replacing line 560 in tensor_util.py by :
return np.frombuffer(tensor.tensor_content, dtype=dtype).reshape(shape)
Thanks for any kind of help :)
