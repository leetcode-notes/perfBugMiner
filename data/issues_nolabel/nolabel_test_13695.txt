Add  'log_progress' argument for tf.estimator.Estimator's evaluate function

The output of estimator.evaluate can be unnecessarily verbose with logging level INFO and many batches to evaluate on. The old tf.contrib.learn.Estimator had the ability to pass the log_progress=False argument along to to tensorflow.python.training.evaluation where it suppresses logging in the after_run function. This PR adds the same functionality for tf.Estimator.
