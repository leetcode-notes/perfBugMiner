Update mobile prepare models documentation

Correct the command line examples to match the actual location of freeze_graph.

Old command line example showed freeze_graph in tensorflow/tools
freeze_graph is actually located in tensorflow/python/tools. The documentation immediately above the command line example states this.
Modify the command line example to run using the tensorflow/python/tools location.
The command line for graph_transforms does not need to be updated.
