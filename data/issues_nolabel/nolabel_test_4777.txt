bug fix when iterators stops at multiple of batch_size

In contrib.learn framwork,  Estmator.fit() supports x, y and batch_size arguments where x and y could be iterators/generators. However, when iterator finishes right at the edge, after exactly integer multiple of batch_size, a run is made anyway with batch_size = 0. This causes NaN errors with following code snippet.
