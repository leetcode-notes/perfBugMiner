saving model under different directory if specified one is already taken

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/builder_impl.py
Line 87
If the specified directory name is already taken, is there a reason why the model saving has to fail instead of saving to some alternate directory? I was wondering if we could add a while loop that says that while the directory name is taken, we'll try again and save it in export_dir + "_" + incr?
