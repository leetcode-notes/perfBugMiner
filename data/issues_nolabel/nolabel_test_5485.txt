Possible bug when instantiating multi RNN cell in PTB LSTM model

Note sure whether this is a bug, since TensorFlow API is unclear on this. Would like someone more familiar with TensorFlow to investigate.
The possible bug is in file tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py on line 115. The line reads:
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell] * config.num_layers, state_is_tuple=True)
According to the API reference, the constructor for MultiRNNCell is:
tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell.init(cells, state_is_tuple=True)
where
cells: list of RNNCells that will be composed in this order.
The following notation:
[lstm_cell] * config.num_layers
will create a list of size config.num_layers, where each element in the list is a reference to the same object lstm_cell. This potentially means that if we modify one layer of "cell", we will also be modifying all the other layers. Is this what we want?
