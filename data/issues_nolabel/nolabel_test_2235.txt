'module' object has no attribute 'conv3d' but only in Jupyter Notebook

Hi! This isn't really a bug, but more a support request.
I tried to use the new conv3d operations from 6a187cc, so I built a pip wheel from the latest sources, created a virtualenv called "tensorflow-dev" and instlled the wheel there.
Now I am running into weirdness that I cannot explain...
Python works:

But the Jupyter notebook does not!!

All three were started form the same shell, after activating the same virtualenv. I really can't explain this. Does anyone have any ideas what's wrong with my install?
