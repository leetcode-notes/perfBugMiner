For poor guys without access to boringssl located in google's server

When I cloned the latest tensorflow and compile it with bazel, bazel clones grpc.git from github.
However grpc.git need clone submodule boringssl which is located in google's server. Since I have no stable vpn to have access to boringssl, I forked grpc.git to my github and changed WORKSPACE of tensorflow (located in tensorflow's root path) as follows:
git_repository(
name = "grpc",

commit = "73979f4",
commit = "403cd6c",
init_submodules = True,
remote = "https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git",
remote = "https://github.com/melody-rain/grpc.git",
)

and also I changed the .gitmodule of grpc.git so that boringssl is downloaded from
[submodule "third_party/boringssl"]
path = third_party/boringssl
url = https://github.com/doubler/boringssl.git
Thanks @doubler for his help.
For those have access to google's service, just ignore this issue,
