Fix numerical warning in the Iris example

When running the script iris_monitors.py, the following message is prompted: WARNING:tensorflow:float64 is not supported by many models, consider casting to float32
The numpy data type float is shorthand  for float64. So, float32 is explicitly specified as solution.
