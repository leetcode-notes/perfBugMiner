Refactor methods for path calculation

@jart I really appreciate your advice. I've rewritten #15315 to be more "boring":

get_grandparent(path, degree) -> a files grandparent of the given degree
get_abs_data_path(path, depth, frame=0) -> path relative to a file upwards the callstack
get_data_files_path(frame=0) -> no change in behavior, but now shared with other methods

They should be about boring enough to be useful and to be shared.

This should resolve the issues with get_data_files_path by making it less brittle...
And I think get_abs_data_path is how get_path_to_datafile should really look like?

Further thoughts on this are appreciated!
