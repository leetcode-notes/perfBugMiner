Tensorflow Java Api Graph support any other than InceptionV3

I'm fairly new to tensorflow, but I've got a general idea of it.
I've retrained Faster RCNN coco model on my own images in ubuntu. and exported the frozen graph.
Now I'm busy writing an Java app in windows that will use the model for object detection, I need bounding boxes etc to can't just use the normal classifier.
In my java app when I try to load/importGraphDef the frozen graph(converted to bytes), I get the following error.
"Op type not registered 'NonMaxSuppressionV2'"
Any and all examples I find online of implementing the tensorflow java api uses inceptionv3.
So my guess is that the java API doesn't yet support other types(faster rcnn in my case) models
Is that correct or are there something else I should be looking at, if it is then I have to rewrite my java app in python...
And if so does anyone know when support will be implemented ?
Thank you.
