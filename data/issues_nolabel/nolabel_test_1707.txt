Clip gradients option in contrib.layers.optimize_loss broken

Using the nightly build from 30 Mar 2016 trying to call:
train_op = tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss(train_loss,
              global_step,
              0.002,
              "Adam",
              clip_gradients=10.0)

will throw:
TypeError: List of Tensors when single Tensor expected

I think opt.compute_gradients() returns a list of tuples not tensors so line 106 needs to replace gradients with [g[0] for g in gradients].
