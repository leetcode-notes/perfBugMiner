Describe the problem
With bazel version 0.6.0, building on the latest stable tagged release (v1.3.1) is not possible. I get the following error:
ERROR: /home/ubuntu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_ubuntu/8ea56cff279f39ec6c0003641e649819/external/io_bazel_rules_closure/closure/private/defs.bzl:27:16: The `set` constructor for depsets is deprecated and will be removed. Please use the `depset` constructor instead. You can temporarily enable the deprecated `set` constructor by passing the flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor=false

ERROR: error loading package '': Extension file 'closure/private/defs.bzl' has errors

When I pass the flag mentioned in the error message (--incompatible_disallow_set_constructor=false) to the pip package build command, I get a similar message:
ERROR: /home/ubuntu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_ubuntu/8ea56cff279f39ec6c0003641e649819/external/org_python_pypi_backports_weakref/BUILD.bazel:17:1: no such package '@org_python_license//': The `set` constructor for depsets is deprecated and will be removed.

This problem does not exist on master. It would be very useful to have even a tiny stable release (v1.3.2 or something) to include this fix for those of us that like to build against a stable release.
