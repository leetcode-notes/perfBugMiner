Fix word2vec_optimized excepction when words contain unicode.

When word2vec_optimized deal with Korean language, it will break out below exception.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "word2vec_optimized.py", line 432, in <module>
    tf.app.run()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py", line 30, in run
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
  File "word2vec_optimized.py", line 417, in main
    model = Word2Vec(opts, session)
  File "word2vec_optimized.py", line 146, in __init__
    self.save_vocab()
  File "word2vec_optimized.py", line 242, in save_vocab
    opts.vocab_counts[i]))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal not in range(128)

I fix this exception by adding encode('utf-8') , and then it successful run word2vec_optimized model.
