tf.multinomial with arbitrarily shaped tensors

It would be nice if once could use tf.multinomial with arbitrary tensors instead of just rank-2 ones. Currently this is only possible by pretending the extends along the other dimensions make for more examples in the batch, i.e. tf.reshape(tf.multinomial(tf.reshape(x, [None, num_classes]), num_samples), x.get_shape().as_list[:-1]).
