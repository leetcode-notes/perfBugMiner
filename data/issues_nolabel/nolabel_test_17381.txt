Cannot feed value of shape (64, 25, 9) for Tensor 'Placeholder:0', which has shape '(?, 25, 25)'

i am trying to train my RNN-LSTM model in python 3.5, this is my code and my dataset is a 3D accelerometer dataset
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, config.n_steps, config.n_inputs])
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, config.n_classes])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    tf.global_variables_initializer().run()

    for epoch in range(training_epochs):
        cost_history = np.empty(shape=[0],dtype=float)
        for b in range(total_batches):
            offset = (b * config.batch_size) % (train_y.shape[0] - config.batch_size)
            batch_x = train_x[offset:(offset + config.batch_size), :, :]
            batch_y = train_y[offset:(offset + config.batch_size), :]

            print ("batch_x shape =",batch_x.shape)
            print ("batch_y shape =",batch_y.shape)

            _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost],feed_dict={X: batch_x, Y : batch_y})
            cost_history = np.append(cost_history,c)
        loss_over_time[epoch] = np.mean(cost_history)

but it gives me the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\hp\Downloads\Deep-Learning-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-master\ModelCreation\RNN\FFLSTM\fflstm.py", line 250, in <module>

ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (64, 25, 9) for Tensor 'Placeholder:0', which has shape '(?, 25, 25)'


and this is the shapes of my dataset
n_inputs len(X_train[0][0]) 25
batch_x shape = (64, 25, 9)
batch_y shape = (64, 2)
X <tf.Tensor 'Placeholder:0' shape=(?, 25, 25) dtype=float32>
Y <tf.Tensor 'Placeholder_1:0' shape=(?, 2) dtype=float32>
