Can't use reshape in a while_loop   InvalidArgumentError

tf.reshape( x ,[batch_size,-1])
Batch_size is a global variable. This instruction within the body of a while loop  produce the error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: The node 'Reshape' has inputs from different frames. The input 'while/strided_slice' is in frame 'while/while/'. The input 'Reshape/shape' is in frame ''.
It's very layered, there are many other similar instructions in the code, reshape that involve global variables, but are compiled correctly.
I'm using tensorflow 1.1 on python3 installed by Anaconda.
