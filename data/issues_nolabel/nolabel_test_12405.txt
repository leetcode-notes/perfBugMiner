tf.boolean_mask doesn't check array bounds.

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
m = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[None, 1], name='m')
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1, None], name='b')
output = tf.boolean_mask(b, m)
mask = [[True],[True],[True],[True],[True]]
y = np.random.rand(1, 4)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(y)
    print(sess.run(output, feed_dict={m: mask, b:y}))
The code runs, while I expect an index out-of-bound error.
In fact, even when mask is a 4x1 boolean, I still expect an error (since b is 1x4). But that's somewhat arguable.
