How to Implement a Secure, Multi-Tenant tensorflow?

I am using tensorflor as miner/ML platform, and now customers are required to support multi-tenant capabilities;
Between the tenants to achieve resource isolation (CPU, MEM, disk, etc.), security isolation.
How do i achieve it?
Has the new version already planned for these features?
