tf.train.Saver() protocol buffer saving issue

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1 gpu
Python version: 3.5.4

Exact command to reproduce: tf.train.Saver()

Describe the problem
When using tf.train.Saver() if you set max_to_keep=None to keep all checkpoint files created then the protocol buffer saved at 'checkpoint' will only save the name of the latest checkpoint created and not all created checkpoints.
When you set max_to_keep=N to be any other value then it will save the latest N checkpoint names as intended.
