NPE hardware acceleration support in Qualcomm chips

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Android OS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): N/A
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6 TFLite
Python version:  N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: See below
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Can anyone clarify what chips will support NPE and have hardware acceleration for on device inference with tf lite?
NPE SDK says 845, 820, 835, 625, 626, 650, 652, 653, 660, 630, 636, 450, 820Am.
I was under the impression that only the 845 had NPE?
