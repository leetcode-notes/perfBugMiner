tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'target_embeddings/read': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because the node was colocated with a group of nodes that required incompatible device '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/GPU:0'
