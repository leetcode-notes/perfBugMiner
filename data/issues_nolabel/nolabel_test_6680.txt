Tensorflow(GPU) build needs to be reconfigured, everytime I reboot my ubuntu

If a just configure tensorflow using ./configure and set CUDA support to YES, tensorflow is successfully built. I can make some change in source code and rebuild using command:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Build after I reboot my ubuntu, and try to build tensorflow using above command, it requires me to reconfigure tensorflow, and rebuild, which takes such a long time. error message is as follows:
