[tensorboard] make projector plugin request data path relative

this PR solves #8342
As in version 1.1rc0, the changes are made:

TensorBoard uses a relative data directory, for easier embedding.

but the request of project plugin data in Embeddings panel, e.g. /data/plugin/projector/runs still requests in a absolute path.  the code
<vz-projector-dashboard
            id="projector"
            route-prefix="/data/plugin/projector">
with the leading slash leads the  absolutely path request.
this PR remove the leading slash.
UPDATED:
new version of code is:
new TF.Dashboard.VzProjectorDashboard('/data/plugin/projector'),
still has a leading slash.
