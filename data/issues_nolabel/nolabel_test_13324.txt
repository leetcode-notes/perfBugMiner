[Windows] Export nsync symbols from the Python extension DLL

Some extension modules (e.g. _gru_ops.dll) expect to be able to link against nsync symbols in the Python extension DLL. Any use of tensorflow::mutex in an extension module will rely on these symbols being exported. However, these are not currently exported as part of the Windows build.
This change modifies the Windows build to export symbols containing nsync_ explicitly.
