TFRecords and Inference issues

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia quadro M6000
Exact command to reproduce:

I converted my dataset into TFrecords and trained my model using a custom Network. Everything was quite fine until i tried to use the trained model by running an inference with the checkpoint files and the problems started there.Without using the _ = tf.contib.data.Dataset line it produces the following error
def create_graph():
    with gfile.FastGFile(os.path.join(model_dir, 'frozen_net.pb'), 'rb') as f:
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        #_ = tf.contrib.data.Dataset   --------------------------->issue with this line 
        _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')


def load_graph(frozen_graph_filename):
    # We load the protobuf file from the disk and parse it to retrieve the 
    # unserialized graph_def
    with tf.gfile.GFile(frozen_graph_filename, "rb") as f:
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

    with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
                    tf.import_graph_def(
                        graph_def, 
                        input_map=None, 
                        return_elements=None, 
                        name="", 
                        op_dict=None, 
                        producer_op_list=None
                    )
                    return graph

This was also the same issue which i faced even for freezing the whole graph ,without importing the Dataset module I'm not able to move forward. Even a normal restoring operation with saver.restore fails.
FYI: I know how to solve the issue but my actual question is why it occurs and why was it not happening when i pickled the dataset and fed in the data?
