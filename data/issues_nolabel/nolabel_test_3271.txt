Reverse for complex numbers

tf.reverse does not seem to be implemented for complex numbers
w_real = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([10], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32))
w_imag = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([10], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32))
w = tf.complex(w_real, w_imag)
w_rev = tf.reverse(w, [True])

I came across this needing to construct a matrix that is conjugate symmetric, but this was also referenced on StackOverflow : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38145235/why-cant-i-reverse-a-sequence-of-complex-numbers-in-tensorflow
