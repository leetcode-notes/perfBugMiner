per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=1 does not allocate all of the memory

Seeing this on TF 0.8 with a Titan X. If I don't specify gpu_options at all, the memory allocated to TF is 11736MB. If I set per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=1.0, I only get 11127MB allocated. It's a small difference, but enough to make my large model crash, while the default allocations lets it just squeak in.
