Move all model implementations to tensorflow/models ?

If I am correct, tensorflow.models is being deprecated.
But some model implementations are still kept inside this directory because of tensorflow tutorials.
I think it would be more straight forward and relevant to keep all the model implementations in tensorflow/models repository.
(This is a same issue discussed in tensorflow/models issue 361.)
I made a pull request that moves all tensorflow/tensorflow model implementations to tensorflow/models without losing commit histories.
I can make another pull request to tensorflow/tensorflow to fully deprecate the model implementations and update tutorials.
