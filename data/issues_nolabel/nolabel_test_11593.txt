Fix issue #10399

Because of the bytes compatibility this function is returning bytes
when it should be returning strings.
Fixes issue "TypeError: Can't mix strings and bytes in path
components" when using tf.contrib.learn.learn_runner with
experiments with an export_strategy.
See issue #10399 for a code example reference.
I didn't find obvious mistakes, but this is my first contribution and
I may have missed something.
