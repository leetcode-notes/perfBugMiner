Official Tensorflow Docker Image

Hello Tensorflow Community,
I just wanted to kick start a discussions on creating an official docker image for Tensorflow. So going in line with creating common framework for machine learning related researchers and developers to rally around, and given the onslaught on software containers, I think creating a common Tensorflow image would also help in the same regard.
I'd normally make a more detailed proposal as I did for a cuda docker image here, but my goal right now is just to facilitate a discussion. I know there are many technical issues thanks in part to heavy use of GPUs and driver dependencies, but it looks like Nvidia is making some progress on that front: NVIDIA/nvidia-docker.
So if you like the idea or have some ideas/drafts, please chime in.
