If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I installed tensorflow around two monthes ago and I've used it.
Then, I tried to update by following Stackoverflow.
I first tried 'git pull', it could not be merged since I have some changes in source.
So I reset the source by
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

Then I did ./configure. But it gives errors. I attached the output of the configure below.
It's weird because I successfully update with this way before.
Actually, I also tried same way in another system (Cuda 7.0 cuDNN 4), but failed with similar error message...
Logs or other output that would be helpful
