Latest commit (524595) for Udacity Assignment 1 breaks IPython Notebook

Hi, I attempted to open the latest IPython Notebook for the Udacity course Assignment 1 from commit 524595 (23 Jan 2016), and it fails with the error:
Unreadable Notebook: ~/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb
NotJSONError('Notebook does not appear to be JSON: u\'{\\n "worksheets": [\\n {\\n "ce...',)

The notebook also fails to load here on Github. If I checkout the previous commit 42154f, the notebook loads correctly.
It's possible this is just me having bad luck, so if important, I'm running Anaconda Python on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.
