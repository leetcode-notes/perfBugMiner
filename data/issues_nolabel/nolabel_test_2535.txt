Steps to reproduce

copy all files in models/rnn/translate/ to ~/myworkfold/
run the translate.py like this: python translate.py --data_dir ./ --train_dir ./   ... (it works well )
But, when i change the code from "from tensorflow.model.rnn.translate import seq2seq_model" to "import seq2seq_model" in translate.py (in order to use the file seq2seq.py in myworkfold, note that all files are copied form models/rnn/translate/ wothout any change )
it errors like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):

What have you tried?
1.i do the same operation for model  LSTM models/rnn/ptb . tensorflow works well
2. if i change back the translate.py file it also works well
What happened ?
