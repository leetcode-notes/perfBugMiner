pip install does not install the examples folder

When doing on my Mac:
sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.6.0-py2-none-any.whl
I got tensorflow to install, but without the examplesdirectory.
There is no mention of that in the setup here:
The page https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html
I needed the examples to do this tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html
(for the time being I just downloaded the whole zip of the repository and copy-pasted the folder, and so far appears to work)
Did I miss anything when installing?
