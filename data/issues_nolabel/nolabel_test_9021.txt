In non-devel Docker images, positively confirm --allow-root with jupyter

to avoid an error that started to happen recently:
[C 10:09:34.858 NotebookApp] Running as root is not recommended. Use
--allow-root to bypass.
E.g., see
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-docker-cpu/TF_DOCKER_BUILD_IS_DEVEL=NO,TF_DOCKER_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON2,label=gcs-access/361/console
This may be caused by recent changes in jupyter.
