Can't import reader.py correctly for rnn/ptb/

I cloned the code and downloaded the dataset. However when I run
python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=simple-examples/data/ --model small
it gives the following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 369, in 
tf.app.run()
File "/Users/fanyang1/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py", line 30, in run
sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 329, in main
train_input = PTBInput(config=config, data=train_data, name="TrainInput")
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 93, in init
self.input_data, self.targets = reader.ptb_producer(
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'ptb_producer'
It seems that for some unknown reason, the reader.py file is not imported correctly.
Is this a python problem or more TensorFlow related problem?
Thanks!
