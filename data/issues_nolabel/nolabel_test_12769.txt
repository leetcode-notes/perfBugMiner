Allow tfcompile_flags to be a list

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #12767 where
it was not possible to specify tfcompile_flags as a list:
tf_library(
  ...
  tfcompile_flags = ["--target_cpu='core-avx2'", "--xla_enable_fast_math=false"]
)

will crash upon build with '+' operator applied to incompatible types (select of string, list)
This is inconsistent with other rules like 'copts' in cc_binary.
The issue is from tfcompile.bzl:
" " + (tfcompile_flags or "")),

This fix uses " ".join(tfcompile_flags or []) instead so that it
is possible to specify the list.
This fix fixes #12767.
