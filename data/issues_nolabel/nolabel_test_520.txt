Changing 1 kernel op requires recompile of the entire kernel package... slow : (

For example, I make some working changes into any one tensorflow/core/my_kernel.{cc,h} file will require the recompile of the entire:
240 tf_cuda_library(
241     name = "kernels",
library, which may be OK for Google assuming you guys have many cores and very fast machines, but for the average developer on say mac laptop, its insanely slow ... total compile time can range several minutes : (
I am not sure what the correct solution is, either fix this in Bazel or seperate out each kernel to have its own build rule?
