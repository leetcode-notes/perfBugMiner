Release notes indicate summary ops were deprecated

The release notes at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases seem to indicate that scalar_summary and a few other *_summary ops were deprecated. Yet the docs for 0.r12 still list all the *_summary ops and do not mention deprecation. Also, I do not get any warnings when using the *_summary ops.
