Build with --define tensorflow_xsmm=1 fails on MacOS Sierra

Building current master after the recent commits to enable libxsmm.
bazel build --copt=-march=native -c opt --define tensorflow_xsmm=1 --verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

The important error lines (I think) are:

tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.cc:1408:3: error: unknown type name 'cpu_set_t'
cpu_set_t old_cpu_set;


tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_matmul_op.cc:1413:39: error: use of undeclared identifier 'cpu_set_t'
ret = sched_getaffinity(0, sizeof(cpu_set_t), &old_cpu_set);

The full result of --verbose_failures is attached.

Searching for 'cpu_set_t' on OSX turned up this code example under heading 2.2 and claims that 'cpu_set_t' is not defined on OSX and Apple's own multithreading code needs to be substituted. So maybe the code using 'cpu_set_t' is not meant to be reached on Macs and the libxsmm code is not ready to be used on my machine.
