help with finetune process

Hi there,
I have run the finetune_inception_v3_on_flowers.sh slim script example, and I have obtained the graph.pbtxt file. How can I use this file in a Python script for image classification? (e.g., https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py)
Thanks.
