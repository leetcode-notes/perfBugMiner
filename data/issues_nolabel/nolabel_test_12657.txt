Undefined op in speech_commands example

I am using tensorflow 1.3.0 built from source.
I run the newly released speech_commands example (its in tensorflow/examples/speech_commands), following all the stuffs and all good. However, after I used the freeze.py script and generated the pb graph, I am unable to load it back. The code I used to load pb graph is:
def load_graph(frozen_graph_filename):
    with tf.gfile.GFile(frozen_graph_filename, "rb") as f:
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

    with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
        tf.import_graph_def(
            graph_def, 
            input_map=None, 
            return_elements=None, 
            name="imported", 
            op_dict=None, 
            producer_op_list=None
        )
    return graph
graph = load_graph('./test_loading_graph_back.pb')

Error:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/importer.py", line 285, in import_graph_def
raise ValueError('No op named %s in defined operations.' % node.op)
ValueError: No op named DecodeWav in defined operations.
