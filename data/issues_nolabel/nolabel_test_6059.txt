Learning works on 0.11 but fails on .12rc0 (Titan X Pascal)

I have a training experiment which fails to learn using TF 0.12rc0, but works fine if I revert TF version to 0.11 and run on the same machine. Unfortunately there are no errors logged, and the symptom is that original run starts improving after 5 minutes, but the 0.12rc0 graph fails to improve. This is blocking our transition to 0.12. It would take a bit of time to isolate the difference to a specific op, meanwhile, any suggestions of things to try?
