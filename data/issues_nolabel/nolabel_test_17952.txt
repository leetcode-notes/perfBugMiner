Describe the problem
I would like an operator that makes it possible to skip a certain/multiple hooks whilst running a tf.train.MonitoredSession(). An example of how this could look is provided below.
The reason why I want this functionality, is that I sometimes want to permit a certain hook(s) from running when calling mon_sess.run(). One reason for this can be that the hook generates unnecessary errors when doing this particular mon_sess.run() call. Another one can be that I simply don't want the hook's functionality on this particular mon_sess.run() call.
Source code / logs
Example code of how this operator could look:
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(
  hooks=[hook1, hook2, hook3, hook4]
) as mon_sess:
  mon_sess.partial_run(fetches=..., feed_dict=..., skip_hooks=[hook1, hook3])

Is this possible?
