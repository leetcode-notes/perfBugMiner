Describe the problem
What is the instruction of checking which version of cuda and cudnn the tensorflow is running on?
like the tensorflow version could be checked by the instruction tf.version .
I want to check my tensorflow 1.4 running on the 8.0 cuda and 6.0 cudnn, not running on the 9.0 cuda and 7.0 cudnn.
