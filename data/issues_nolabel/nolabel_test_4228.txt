AttributeError: No svd operator in 0.10.0rc0

Issue #2207 and documentation both indicate that tensorflow has a svd operator.
However, I can't find it in fresh install of tensorflow0.10 with pip for python3.5 (both cpu and gpu )
Environment info
Operating System: Linux (arch, kernel 4.7.2)
Pip installed (in two different virtualenv):

https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf
tf.svd

AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'svd'
