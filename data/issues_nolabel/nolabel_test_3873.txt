Modify the mnist_replica.py:
1.Add FLAGS.ps_hosts, FLAGS.worker_hosts and get_cluster_setter() function to set the cluster and allocate the device. It's more likely the Distributed Tutorial of Tensorflow here
2.Add the gpu_num argument to allocate the gpu for worker server
3.Add Flags.steps_per_checkpoint to manage the saving time of checkpoint file.
