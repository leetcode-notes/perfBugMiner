Add uint32 and uint64 support for `bitwise_and/or/xor`

In tensorflow/core/ops/bitwise_ops.cc, uint32 and uint64 have been enabled for bitwise operations and/or/xor/left_shift/right_shift.
However, the kernels of and/or/xor have no support of uint32 and uint64.
This is in comparision to left_shift/right_shift which have the uint32/uint64 support, and, is tested in bitwise_ops_test.py.
This fix adds uint32 and uint64 to bitwise and/or/xor kernels.
This fix also adds relevant test cases in bitwise_ops_test.py, to bring and/or/xor as left_shift/right_shift.
