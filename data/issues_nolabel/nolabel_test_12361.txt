Verbs hang fix

Replaces the sync wrappers for device to device operations in verbs_util, with a call to the async function with a callback function. Resolves Issue #11725
As mentioned in the issue:
I think the problem rises because the Sync deviceToDevice operation blocks the thread, preventing the earlier Async Device to Device operation from finishing- which, for some reason, blocks the later operation.
I've tested this fix in origin/r1.3 since origin/master is currently broken.
2nd commit only removes the unused functions from verbs_utils. It is not required for validity.
@junshi15 , @shamoya , @byronyi , can you please go over this?
