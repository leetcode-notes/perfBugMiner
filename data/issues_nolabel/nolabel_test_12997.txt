Ability to read multi-channel image format

Though the tf.decode_image() function can handle a few different image encodings, all of these encodings can only support a maximum of 4 channels in an image (RGBA).   One format which can support a larger number of channels is TIFF (which is currently not supported in TF, perhaps due to its complex specification?).  It would be convenient if TF could support decoding TIFF or some other format that is able to represent an arbitrary number of channels, N (which could be decoded into an [H, W, N] shaped tensor).
