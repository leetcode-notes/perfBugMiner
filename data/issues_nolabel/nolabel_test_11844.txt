tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn not found

I am using tensorflow version 0.12.1 and trying to implement simple RNN using static_rnn.
lstm_layer=tf.contrib.rnn.LayerNormBasicLSTMCell(n_hidden,forget_bias=1)
outputs, states = tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn(lstm_cell, x, dtype=tf.float32)

The IDE is not able to resolve static_rnn.
In tensorflow documentation tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn is listed here.But on clicking on it it redirects to 404 page.Is there a change in static_rnn in tensorflow?If yes then whats the new alternative/implementation?
