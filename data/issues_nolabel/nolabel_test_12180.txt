Adding support for s390x in calculation of cpu_frequency

PR for changing the GetCycleCounterFrequency for s390x to fix test //tensorflow/core:platform_profile_utils_cpu_utils_test.
Facing issue similar to power reported here .
On s390x too cpu_frequency = -1 and hence below test fails:
[ RUN      ] CpuUtilsTest.CheckCycleCounterFrequency
2017-07-17 04:43:02.050579: F tensorflow/core/platform/profile_utils/cpu_utils_test.cc:57] Check failed: cpu_frequency > 0 (-1 vs. 0)

Extending the fix added for PPC raised via PR
