tensorflow Makefile build does not support building arm64-v8a static library for Android

Currently tensorflow has only support build static library in armeabi-v7a for Android.
And the build script has not support the other platforms yet as we can see in:
tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile
Our team would like to build all the architecture for Android if possible, and we tried to fixed the makefile that expect to link with our Android project but got many linking errors except armeabi-v7a.
So, I was just wondering if tensorflow will support those platform: arm64-v8a, x86, x88_64?
