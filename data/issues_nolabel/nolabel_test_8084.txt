Difference of allocate_persistent() and allocate_temp()

This is a question on the usage of the two functions which are used in Compute() method for defining new Op.
My understanding is that allocate_temp() are used only and once in constructing Op and cannot be used during traning or testing steps later on; whereas allocate_persistent() can be used in both Op construction and traning or testing steps later on. Am I correct?
When I was defining my own new Op, I need to allocate a temporay GPU memory buffer in my Compute() method. The buffer will be used every time I call Compute(), however, I don't need to store the value in the temporary buffer for future reuse. In this case, which function should I use?
When calling the two functions, do we need to call corresponding functions like free_persistent() or free_temp()?
