Fix for AVX2 support in Visual Studio

This is a fix for issue #10199. Visual Studio 2015 (possibly other versions) lacks definitions for  _mm256_extract_epi8, -16, -32, or -64 in the immintrin.h header, nor in the associated runtime, so it must be implemented manually.
For wider portability these functions are renamed based on their required extraction indices. These intrinsics should be just as fast as the externally linked versions provided by GCC.
