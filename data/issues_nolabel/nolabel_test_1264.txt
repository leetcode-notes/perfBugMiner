Hi all
I am caffe user.
I've executed caffe application since the end of the last year.
Until i tried to install tensorflow, my system is working well.
After install tensorflow 0.7 from source code.
it shows me some error like below.
Even though i installed protobuf 3.0 via pip and source code, i couldn't solve this problem.
I think there is some static variable for requiring specific version of protobuf(in this case 3.0).
Do you have any idea for this problem?
