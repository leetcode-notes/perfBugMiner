Compiling from source, ./configure, issue finding cudnn

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7
GPU model and memory: Nvidia 1070 8GB
Exact command to reproduce: On ./configure

When following the building from source installation instructions, the first step involves running a ./configure.
During this script, you are prompted for the versions and locations of features you want support for in the build.
When getting down to the CUDA SKD version, you will get something like:
Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 8.0]: 9.0
I'm using 9.0...
Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]: 7.0
I'm using 7.0...
However, if you type 7.0, you get the following:
Invalid path to cuDNN  toolkit. Neither of the following two files can be found:
/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64/libcudnn.so.7.0
/usr/local/cuda-9.0/libcudnn.so.7.0
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn.so.7.0
But if you answer the following as:
Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]: 7
It works.
The actual name is libcudnn.so.7, can can't find libcudnn.so.7.0. Otherwise it won't find it, and it looks like you have installed incorrectly.
Can we get a fix for this?
