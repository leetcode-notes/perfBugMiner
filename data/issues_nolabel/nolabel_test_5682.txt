Implement a method that returns amount of seconds since the epoch (time)

In order to add timestamp to the tf.Print (as per #2076 ) there should be a method that provides time (something like: SecondsAfterEpoch). Existing API (env.h) provides 2 method to obtain time:

NowSeconds;
NowMicros;

This makes both of them unusable for the task of adding the timestamp to the logging output.
