Provide a working example involving reading csv data

I have successfully read in csv data.  I have successfully trained/classified using the mnist data utility.  But I have not successfully been able to train from csv data.
It would also be helpful to clarify pack vs concat which is done on at StackOverflow for a given question but is left unexplained on the tensorflow site.
