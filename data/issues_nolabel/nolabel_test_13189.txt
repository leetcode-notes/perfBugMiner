Non-scalar Multinomial draws

This PR tries to fix the issue in #12804 where supports total_count to be a non-scalar tensor and broadcasts by map_fn.
The reason why I use map_fn to broadcast manually is that current tf.multinomial sampler op don't support to produce different total_count within a batch, and map_fn can enhance this underlying op effectively without modifying it.
It's a little dilemma if we modify the underlying op to support different total_count within a batch, because that will produce variable-length draws within a batch, unless we add a new function with different interface for multinomial sampler.
