GAN model: move generated and real operations under discriminator namespace

Hi everybody,
gan_model runs the discriminator on both the generated and real data. This PR changes/fixes the namespace of the generated graph.

Current: The network variables and operations on generated data are in the Discriminator namespace but the operations on real data are in the Discriminator_1 namespace.
PR: The network variables stay in the Discriminator namespace. Operations on generated data are in Discriminator/generated and operations on real data are in Discriminator/real.

gan_model only searches the Discriminator namespace for regularization. Presumably, if you were running activity regularization in your discriminator, only the part on generated data would be picked up. Plus, the graph looks much better visually this way and you can tell which discriminator is which.
Cheers
