Update seq2seq

This PR brings updates to the seq2seq examples, removing all of the with ops.device("/cpu:0"):.
There are many ops implemented with cuda kernels recently, so maybe it's time to remove some cpu device specifications from the translate.py examples.
I don't have profile numbers for the translate.py example, but according to a similar experiment, this will boost the speed 5~6 times on a NVIDIA Titan GPU, especially when there are more than one independent runs going together.
Side note: when training with multiple cards (independent runs), the frequent data transfer between gpu and cpu is particularly harmful in my case.
