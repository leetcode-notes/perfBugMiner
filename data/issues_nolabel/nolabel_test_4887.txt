resnet model in tf slim does not take is_training param

Compare the resnet_v2 model to the vgg model. The vgg model takes is_training whereas the resnet model does not. This param should be taken and passed to the batch_norm layers.
The docs for the v1 model do reference is_training, but I don't see it used.
