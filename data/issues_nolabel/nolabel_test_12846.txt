Unable to install tensorflow=1.0.0

I have been trying to install tensorflow 1.0.0 using pip in Anaconda environment. I found the below error while installation. I have seen previous posts in github and stackover flow but I couldn't find the solution.
(C:\Users\naresh.kumar\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3) C:\Users\naresh.kumar>pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade  https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_x86_64.whl
pip = 9.0.1
python = 3.6.1
Anaconda=4.3.21
Please help me out how to solve this issue.
