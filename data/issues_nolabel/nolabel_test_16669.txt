Describe the problem
When I enable the memory optimizer in grappler, it fails with the following errors:
E tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc:720] No output shape in Conv2DBackpropInput op.
E tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc:720] No output shape in Conv2DBackpropInput op.

My network is mostly a ResNet 34. I cannot share the complete code right now, but I can try to come up with a reduced example if it is necessary.
Is this a limitation of the current memory optimizer or should the output shape always be known at this point in the code?
