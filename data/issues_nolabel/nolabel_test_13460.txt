Feature request: segment_argmax

Currently trying to return argmax from a tensor for selected slices (segments)
slices do not have the same length, so reshaping can't be used.
was looking for a function similar to tf.segment_max, only with indices as the return value.
for e.g
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
seg = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
tf.segment_argmax  return value will be
[2, 4, 5]
