Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/tensorflow/Graph : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0

When I use tf java API, there is a problem Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/tensorflow/Graph. It seems that the jdk version 1.7 can not user the lib. So, I want to know whether can I use java api with jdk1.7 and how?
