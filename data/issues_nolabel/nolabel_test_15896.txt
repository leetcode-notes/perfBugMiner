Add EvalResultsExporter for writing the results of evaluation to a file

Previously you could capture the return value of estimator.train_and_evaluate,
which was a dictionary of the final evaluation results (like accuracy, AUC).
Since estimator.train_and_evaluate no longer returns a value, it looks like
there's no way to get the eval_results dictionary directly. This is the
solution I wrote for getting and storing that dictionary. Since the solution
is generalizable, I thought it'd be useful to include it for others to use.
