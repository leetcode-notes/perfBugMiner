Documentation truncated_normal does not match implementation

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux CentOS 7.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee 1.3.0

CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 6.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Tesla 12 GB
Exact command to reproduce: ?

Describe the problem
The documentation of tf.truncated_normal[https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/truncated_normal] contains the following line for its parameter stddev:

The standard deviation of the truncated normal distribution.

However, the example below shows that the truncated normal does not have the given standard deviation. This means that the documentation would be correct if it said

The standard deviation of the normal distribution, before truncation.

or if the standard deviation of the samples would be indeed the given standard deviation.
Source code / logs
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# standard deviation not 1
with tf.Session():
    print(np.std(tf.truncated_normal([10000, ], stddev=1).eval()))

# compared to scipy
from scipy.stats import truncnorm
print(truncnorm(-2, 2, loc=0, scale=1).std())
