Fix broken links in tutorial/layers

This PR is to fix:

As you can see in tutorial/layers, the below link of "Training and Evaluating the CNN MNIST Classifier" is actually broken, which should be updated as "https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers#training_and_evaluating_the_cnn_mnist_classifier"


If you're already experienced with CNNs and TensorFlow Estimators, and find the above code intuitive, you may want to skim these sections or just skip ahead to "Training and Evaluating the CNN MNIST Classifier".


The below two links are broken due to new lines within the link.


Note: For a more in-depth look at configuring training ops for Estimator model functions, see @{$get_started/custom_estimators#defining-the-training-op-for-the-model$"Defining the training op for the model"} in the @{$get_started/custom_estimators$"Creating Estimations in tf.estimator"} tutorial.


Delete the alias of the title which is format as {#...} right after the title name since it's not required according to the maner of the most *.md in the doc_src folder.
