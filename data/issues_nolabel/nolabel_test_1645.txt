Error on SummaryWriter creation

I'm loading a graph from a file and I'd like to see what the topology is. As there doesn't seem to be a way to do this in python (the best I can do is guess the tensor names and use graph.get_tensor_by_name), I'm trying to produce a Summary which I can then view with TensorBoard. Unfortunately, instantiating the SummaryWriter object gives me an error:
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

I'm using the pip3 install of tensorflow 7.1 on Ubuntu 15.10.
