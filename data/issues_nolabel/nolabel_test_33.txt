Error while installing tensorflow using pip on Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit system

Hi devs,
I was trying to install the package in Ubuntu when this error is occurring. I am not sure what the reason is since I am using Python 2.7.6 and already have numpy and six installed.
/usr/local/bin/pip run on Tue Nov 10 12:44:29 2015
tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Exception information:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/basecommand.py", line 122, in main
  status = self.run(options, args)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/commands/install.py", line 257, in run
  InstallRequirement.from_line(name, None))
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/req.py", line 167, in from_line
   raise UnsupportedWheel("%s is not a supported wheel on this platform." % wheel.filename
UnsupportedWheel: tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on    this  platform.

Apologies if this is a common problem. Thanks in advance :)
