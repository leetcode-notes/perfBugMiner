Simplify getting variable by name

Suppose we created a variable foo/v
with tf.variable_scope("foo"):
    v = tf.get_variable("v", [1])

To get this variable from its name one currently needs to write two lines:
with tf.variable_scope("foo", reuse=True):
    v1 = tf.get_variable("v")

Instead, it would be much more intuitive to just write:
v1 = tf.get_variable("foo/v", reuse=True)
