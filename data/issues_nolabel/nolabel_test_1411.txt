Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.
but I didn't start python at the tensorfliw source directory
$ pwd
/anaconda/bin
How to  solve the problem?
