Fix broken python3 build

Currently building tensorflow master branch with python3 fails with following error message.
ERROR: ${BAZEL_CACHE}/external/astor_archive/BUILD:8:1: Converting to Python 3: external/astor_archive/astor/code_gen.py failed (Exit 1).

It seems that the 3 newly added third_party/*.BUILD scripts from 4080654 are missing srcs_version = "PY2AND3" part, which all the other py_library modules have.
I'm using bazel 0.5.4 on linux ubuntu 16.04 to build the current master branch.
