GPU memory problem when using tensorflow 1.0.0 on TITAN X (Pascal)

Environment info
Operating System: Fedora 25
cuda 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1
TITAN X (Pascal) and Driver Version: 375.26
I installed tensorflow 1.0.0 using pip install under anaconda
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
I have a problem when using tensorflow on TITAN X (Pascal) . I am able to ran my code on other type of GPUs. I also tried running theano and matconvnet on the same GPU but there is no problem.
I tried several ways to check it.

if I directly run sess = tf.Session(), it gets stuck there.

I also tried to set allow_growth=True and it is able to run tf.Session.
gpu_options= tf.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True)
tf_config = tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True, gpu_options=gpu_options)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf_config)

I check the GPU memory being used, it is 151MB.

I also tried to allocate different amount of GPU memory in the following way and it crashed.
tf_config = tf.ConfigProto()
tf_config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.1
sess = tf.Session(config=tf_config)

Can anyone help me on this? Thanks a lot.
