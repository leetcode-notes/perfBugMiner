Relaxing inferenced shape

Inferenced shape will put restriction on feeding, so sometimes it is desirable to relax inferenced shape. Currently this can be done by lambda x: tf.cond(tf.constant(True), lambda: x, lambda: tf.placeholder(x.dtype)), or tf.placeholder_with_default if gradient is not required (placeholder_with_default has no gradient registered).
I also read a comment in identity_op.cc:

PlaceholderWithDefault does the same thing as Identity, but has a
different shape function (and constant value function) registered.

Possibly register a gradient for placeholder_with_default?
