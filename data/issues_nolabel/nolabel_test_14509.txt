Function for explicit broadcasting

It would be convenient to have an explicit function for broadcasting in TensorFlow's Python API, like to numpy.broadcast_to or XLA's Broadcast, and as requested on StackOverFlow. This would facilitate adding broadcasting-like behavior to the many TensorFlow operations that don't support it out of the box.
I understand that in general TensorFlow does not implement NumPy's the strided N-dimensional array data model, so unlike the case for NumPy, broadcasting (e.g., with Eigen tensors) can require a copy. This is a good reason to not necessarily build such a version of broadcasting into ops. However, explicit broadcasting rather than using tile/expand_dims can still be very convenient.
