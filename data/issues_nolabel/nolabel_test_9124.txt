[CMake] Optionally support building TF as a shared lib

Currently, TF is already built as a shared library that is included in the Python package. However, that library:

Is implicitly linked against Python libs, and thus expects Python to be present on the machine wherever it is used. It is undesirable for scenarios not requiring Python (e.g. native application that need TensorFlow).
Does not include the TF C++ API.

This PR allows optionally building TF as a stand-alone DLL that does not have the above issues. I am also working on allowing CMake to link all C++ tests against that DLL, and will submit such changes in a separate PR.
As a bonus, this PR also fixes a build break for tf_tools.cmake when GPU is enabled.
