How can i read csv file by file name and line number in tensorflow?

I read some csv files using queue like this.  Then, i get key and value when reading from file queues. The key contains file name and line number.
    filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(["file0.csv", "file1.csv"]) 
    reader = tf.TextLineReader()
    key, value = reader.read(filename_queue)

I train model using Dynamic negative sampling like IRGAN code. I need sample from large scale negative samples, so i want to save the example id such as filename:line rather than feature itself.
However, i can not find a suitable function on document.
Thanks for your attention!
