Error when serializing LAYER_NAME_UIDS

System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version: v1.2.0-rc0-312-g0b72359 1.2.0-rc0
Bazel version: 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1

After recompiling TensorFlow I got this strange log message.
I doesn't seem to affect any of the computation.
All of the other tools behave as expected.
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing LAYER_NAME_UIDS.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
