Use Bazel 0.1.1

Currently, the TensorFlow Getting Started doc recommends using Bazel 0.1.0. This is a pretty old release, and a number of bugs, such as bazelbuild/bazel#586, has been fixed since then.
This is a tracking bug to switch to a newer version of Bazel. I believe we are in the process of cutting a new release. I will ping this bug once we are ready to update the docs to recommend using a newer Bazel release.
