Fix Bazel CI / TensorFlow project.

This change:


updates common_env.sh to export PYTHON_LIB_PATH
along with PYTHON_BIN_PATH so the configure
scripts doesn't have to guess


writes these paths to bazelrc with quotes
around, to guard agains spaces in the path (e.g.
"C:/Program Files/Anaconda3/python")


Fixes bazelbuild/bazel#2892
