Bazel missing dependency declaration for Eigen

Compilation error that suggests Bazel is not recognizing the Eigen header files. Occurs consistently for me on all versions starting from 21716d8 up until the current master (0072675).
Environment info
64-bit CentOS / cuda 7.5.18 / cudnn 5.0.5 / bazel 0.2.1 / java 1.8.0_91
Steps to reproduce
Run ./configure and set up compilation with CUDA 7.5 and CuDNN 5.0.
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Compiles fine without --config=cuda.
What have you tried?
I ran a git bisect and traced it to 21716d8. More specifically, it is moving Eigen out of the eigen-eigen-b4fa9622b809 folder that for some reason is causing this. Reverting only these changes from the master makes it compile just fine (see gustavla/tensorflow@058a651). I have so far been unable to fix it while keeping the strip_prefix in.
It suspect it might be a quirk in bazel 0.2.1. It would be great if anyone else running that version can confirm.
