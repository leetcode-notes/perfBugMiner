contrib.learn.LinearClassifier steps not working as tutorial instructs

In tutorial it is written
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=200)
The state of the model is preserved in the classifier, which means you can train iteratively if you like. For example, the above is equivalent to the following:
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=100)
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=100)
But whne I try on my own, the same step parameter and evaluate the model, the results are all the time the same, only when I increase the parameter, the accuracy changes. Based on the behavior I believe the steps are rememebered and only new steps are fitted/performed.
So the equivalent is
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=100)
classifier.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train, steps=200)
Can anybody check this?
