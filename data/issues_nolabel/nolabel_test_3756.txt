Beam Search Wrapper

I've been working with the beam search implementation @nikitakit wrote to fix issue #654 , and found the outputs aren't exactly what they should be (unless I'm misunderstanding something). It seems the top output is correct but the rest of the beams are not reordered correctly in the computation. This is my fixed version with a more detailed test case to prove correctness, as well as an attention wrapper to be able to use beam search with attention without much effort. I think it would be great to nail down some official solution.
