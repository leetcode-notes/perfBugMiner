Embed __version__ into package

Hi,
it would be nice to embed a version into the tensorflow package for reproducibility. The common Python convention is to do this via __version__ attribute in the __init__.py file so that one can import the package and verify its version.
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)

This is very helpful for reproducibility and managing different virtual environments.
