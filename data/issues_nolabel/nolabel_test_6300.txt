Add orthogonal initialization

Lasagne has orthogonal initialization like in this reference and it's pretty useful (and quite intuitive: make sure random weights are orthogonal so they should tend to learn different modes in the input and not converge to being redundant).
TODO

 Add unit test
 Verify code style
 Verify docstring style
 Don't import NumPy if possible (is there a SVD in TensorFlow somewhere?)
