Tensorflow just not working

I stopped using tensorflow for a while. Now i want to get back to it, but after installing, when I try to import tensorflow module on python i get this message:
Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there

Have tried uninstalling all previous existing versions and exiting any tensorflow folder, i'm running python from root folder, but I still get the error. Also if I download tensorflow from github and run from tensorflow version 6.0 I get same error
Any idea?
Thanks
