Not able to use tensorflow::mutex (../nptl/pthread_mutex_lock.c: No such file or directory)

Hi All,
I am trying to add a self-defined class under the core/common_runtime/ directory to log the information of each step([https://github.com/laosiaudi/tensorflow/blob/test/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/graph_logger.cc]) and try to use the tensorflow::mutex as step_stats_collector does, but when I run the example/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py, it throws out a segmentation fault. After inspecting via gdb, it reports the error "../nptl/pthread_mutex_lock.c: No such file or directory.".
Could you please provide some advice of how to use tensorflow::mutex correctly or how to fix such errors? Should I modify some BUILD files? I have been stuck in this for a while.
Thanks!
