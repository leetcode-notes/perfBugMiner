max_pool_with_argmax index calculation

max_pool_with_argmax returns an argmax array which doesn't seem to account for the batch dimension. That is, the op returns the flattened index as: (height * width + x) * channels + c instead of ((b * height + y) * width + x) * channels + c as indicated in the API
