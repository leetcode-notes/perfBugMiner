pool allocator spending more than 18h to allocate and still not finished

Hey guys, I've been having this issue which I don't really understand if it's related to memory issues or not. I've tested it on cpu and the code runs fine without any issues. On gpu I get the following messages:

It's been like this for 18h and still no output or training has started, is this a known issue. Why does it take so long for the memory allocator to finish?
