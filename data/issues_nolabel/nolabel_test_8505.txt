tutorials/rnn/translate/translate.py Errors

Hello,
I am trying to run the "translate.py" example from the sequence to sequence tutorial but it fails.
The tensorflow version is today nightly built (tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl). The model git containing the tutorial  is at the latest commit on the master branch.
I am using a linux OS.
The error message is:
ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 1 for 'model_with_buckets/sequence_loss/sequence_loss_by_example/sampled_softmax_loss/MatMul_1' (op: 'MatMul') with input shapes: [?], [?,1024]
Many thanks!
