Ability to add to an existing named scope

Currently it is impossible to use tf.name_scope to add additional elements to an existing scope. Using the same name a second time creates a new scope (with an appended index). This means that any elements that need to be in the same scope must be defined close together in source, which is not always consistent with the logic of the code.
A desirable feature would be the ability to add to an existing named scope, either with a new named parameter for tf.name_scope (e.g. Boolean add_to_existing), or with a new related function (e.g., tf.existing_name_scope).
