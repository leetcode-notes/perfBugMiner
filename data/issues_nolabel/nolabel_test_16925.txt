Describe the problem
I'm not sure if that's how using bidirectional_dynamic_rnn with Grid3LSTMCell works but it's giving outputs that are of different shapes: the first one has three dimensions and the second one has four dimensions.
Source code / logs
Here's the code:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import grid_rnn

class BidirectionalGridRNNCellTest(tf.test.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.num_features = 1
        self.time_steps = 1
        self.batch_size = 1
        tf.reset_default_graph()
        self.input_layer = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [self.batch_size, self.time_steps, self.num_features])
        self.cell_fw = grid_rnn.Grid3LSTMCell(num_units=8)
        self.cell_bw = grid_rnn.Grid3LSTMCell(num_units=8)

    def test_bidirectional_dynamic_grid_rnn(self):
        outputs, output_states = tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn(self.cell_fw, self.cell_bw, self.input_layer, dtype=tf.float32)
        print(outputs)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    tf.test.main()

And here's the output of the print statement:
((<tf.Tensor 'bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/transpose:0' shape=(1, 1, 8) dtype=float32>,), <tf.Tensor 'ReverseV2:0' shape=(1, 1, 1, 8) dtype=float32>)
