Android Example utils fail on models > 64MB

I've been trying to get started with tensorflow and I wanted to use an image recognition model I trained in the android example, but when I tried to replace the models in the example with my model, it would crash without a lot of information.
I finally figure out that ReadFileToProto in jni_utils.cc does not support reading files larger than 64MB: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/jni/jni_utils.cc#L107
Adding these lines seemed to fix the issue of not being able to load my graph at all:
::google::protobuf::io::CodedInputStream coded_stream(&adaptor);
coded_stream.SetTotalBytesLimit(1024LL << 20, 512LL << 20);

coded_stream.Skip(start);
CHECK(message->ParseFromCodedStream(&coded_stream));

I'm probably not the first to stumble into this problem, but I feel like I just wasted hours of my life on a trivially avoidable problem and I hope no-one else has to waste time on that little bit of protobuf trivia.
