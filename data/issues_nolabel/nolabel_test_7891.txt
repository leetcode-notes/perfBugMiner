Improve tensorboard smoothing

The smoothing of training loss in Tensorboard was frustrating; it would seemingly select a random set of unfiltered points near the end of the loss history leaving one unable to see the most recent trend.
I see that at least one other person was annoyed at this, as a change has been committed to master that changes the behavior. I think the change in this PR is superior. The previous one appears to have just truncated the smoothed curve, whereas this one will smooth all the way up until the end. When I'm 400K training iterations in, I find myself really wanting to see how the trend has gone in those last 20K iterations.
I also notice that the previous commit didn't update dist/tf-tensorboard.html, which I think is the only thing that affects most people running latest master.
