Bus error (core dumped)

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I have not attempted solutions because I know of none -- it seems like there is a bus error when loading the driver, and I'm not sure how to proceed
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
Not sure if the output of the core dump is going to be useful or where to find it. Help would be appreciated.
