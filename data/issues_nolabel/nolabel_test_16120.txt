Utility classes for writing Java source code from a C++ process (part 3)

Part 3 (and last) of pull request #14094 that has been split into several commits.
This part features Java output streams, based on the previously-commited SourceWriter, to output Java code with a stream-like API. After this PR, everything will be setup to write Java code from the generator so we could start focusing again on the real thing: ops generation.
