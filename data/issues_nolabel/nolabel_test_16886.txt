Please support Cuda 9.1

I tried cloning the alpha zero chess from https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero and almost got everything to work.  However when I try "python src/chess_zero/run.py self" I get the message
ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_90.dll'. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Download and install CUDA 9.0 from this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
The problem is that I have CUDA 9.1 and cannot seem to get CUDA 9.0 on the website.  Would it be hard to make a version of TensorFlow-gpu that works with CUDA 9.1 ?

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
e:\eDownloads>python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
