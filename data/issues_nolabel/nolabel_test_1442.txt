Same model behaves different when restored in Linux vs OSX

Using the recent TensorFlow pip install 0.7.0 I have encountered some frustrating behavior. It might be something I'm doing wrong on my end, but I've ruled out everything I can.
Here's what's happening:
I've trained a model on a linux system using a GPU. I then scp the checkpoint file to my mac, and restored the checkpoint file into exactly the same code-base. However, the results were much poorer. Thinking I might have a bug or a bad saved model, I went back to the linux and loaded the saved model there, reran the exact same evaluation procedure using identical data, code, etc. and the results were much better once again. I don't know anything about the purpose of the ckpt.meta file, but copying this into the same directory didn't help.
Does this sound familiar at all? Again, I can't rule out a bug on my end, but everything is identical as far as I can tell, apart from the running environment (Linux+GPU vs Mac). Any ideas?
