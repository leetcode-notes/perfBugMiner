Tensorflow - Error: Cannot convert value dtype('<f4') to a TensorFlow DType

I receive an error when testing a Neural Style Transformation project with Tensorflow & OpenCV using the "lion" test image. The source of test project is:  [ https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf ]. Both Tensorflow and OpenCV packages were installed and compiled from source. The training model used is: imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat and the runtime environment runs on a s390x CPU and does not use any CUDA support. The  current Python environment is 2.7 under Docker Linux Ubuntu 16.
Run command:
bash stylize_image.sh ./image_input/lion.jpg ./styles/kandinsky.jpg
The error message at log is:
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py", line 584, in as_dtype
    "Cannot convert value %r to a TensorFlow DType." % type_value)
TypeError: Cannot convert value dtype('<f4') to a TensorFlow DType.

Versions installed:
python 2.7.12
import tensorflow as tf 
>>> print tf.VERSION
1.3.1
import cv2 
>>> print cv2.__version__ 
3.3.0
>>> print np.__version__
1.13.2


Is this a known issue?
