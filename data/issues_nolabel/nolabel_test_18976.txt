TFlite TransposeConv op supported but unregistered

Describe the problem
I'm trying to convert my custom model to tflite using tf.contrib.lite.toco_convert.
The model has some TransposeConv in it. I expect these to convert as looking at commit 58fe7d2 there does seem to be quite a bit of code in place to support transposeconv, including the actual implementation and graph transformations. However when I run the conversion it tells me it's not supported (see below output).
It seems like this op is supported but simply unregistered for some reason, which might be a bug or maybe there is some mysterious reason it cannot be registered?
Thanks
