Accompany TF_LoadLibrary with TF_DeleteLibrary

The C API provides the following function for loading libraries:
extern TF_Library* TF_LoadLibrary(const char* library_filename, TF_Status* status);
The documentation says that “the caller owns the library handle” returned by the function. Unlike other functions allocating memory and returning pointers, TF_LoadLibrary doesn’t have a counterpart for properly freeing the memory. Note that it’s not about unloading the library but about deallocating the TF_Library struct; although, a function for unloading the library would also be nice. Thanks!
