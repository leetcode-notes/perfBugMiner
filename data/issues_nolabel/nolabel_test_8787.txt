TFRecord integration with Keras API

Since the Keras-2 API is now directly in TensorFlow, I think it would be very useful if there were a mechanism directly in TensorFlow to supply TFRecords to Keras, such as in a call to model.fit(), or with equivalent functionality to flow_from_directory.
One key implementation detail is with the way model.compile() works as detailed in a comment on this topic in keras. As discussed in the same comment, numpy arrays have been determined to be the primary way of interacting with Keras, so this should not be an upstream Keras request because TFRecords currently require TensorFlow, so other backends couldn't be supported easily.
