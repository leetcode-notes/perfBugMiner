Possible bug in ctc_beam_search_test.cc ?

Hello,
I've found something very confusing in the above file, I can't see how line number 54 can work correctly.
 to_state->labels.push_back(to_label);

From what I can make out each child beam entry has a new state associated with it, so the to_state being passed to the ExpandState method should only ever be called with a single label, representing the current class at that time.
I'm attempting to integrate a full n-gram language model into a beam scorer and this certainly seems to be the case. In order to build a string of all characters in the beam I must make a reference back to from_state in my HistoryBeamState and traverse back up the tree.
This is not the case in the unit test though, and in fact if I log some output there I can see the to_state being reused with different to_label values. Hence the test does pass.
Have I greatly misunderstood something here or is this not what the expected behaviour should be? I notice the test has a beam width less that the number of classes in the input tensor, which I guess is not so realistic? Perhaps I'm seeing an artifact of this?
Any feedback would be great, I think understanding is correct but can't make sense of this unit test.
