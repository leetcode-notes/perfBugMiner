Tensorflow lite version 0.1.7 is too slow

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): android
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): no
Python version: no
Bazel version (if compiling from source): no
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): no
CUDA/cuDNN version: no
GPU model and memory: no
Exact command to reproduce: no

I used the Tensor Flowlight library on my device. Until then, the operation speed was 300ms. However, it took more than a second after using the 0.1.7 version of the Tensor Flow Lite version released this week. If i use the current 0.0.0-nightly version, it takes 300ms again. The question is whether or not you have removed the option that the 0.1.7 version of the library uses neon.
