Fix two external anchor link in kernel method tutorial

This PR is to fix:


The link of tf.contrib.learn.Estimator. As we can see in the note section of kernel method tutorial, the two below highlighted link was broken and I can see from the latest source code the second one was fixed while the first one wasn't pointed to the correct place;

Note: This document uses a deprecated version of ${tf.estimator}, which has a ${tf.contrib.learn.estimator$different interface}. It also uses other contrib methods whose ${$version_compat#not_covered$API may not be stable}.



The accurate link of input function section. It should be @{$get_started/premade_estimators#create_input_functions$this section on input functions} instead of #input_fn.
