Unable to use TF with a Maven project on Windows

I get the following errors when I tried to use tensorflow with maven project on windows:
"""
Error injecting constructor, java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot find TensorFlow native library for OS: windows, architecture: x86. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java/README.md for possible solutions (such as building the library from source). Additional information on attempts to find the native library can be obtained by adding org.tensorflow.NativeLibrary.DEBUG=1 to the system properties of the JVM.
"""
And I use maven in project:
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
        <artifactId>tensorflow</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>

It works well on OS but failed on windows. Anyone knows how to fix this? Massive thanks!
