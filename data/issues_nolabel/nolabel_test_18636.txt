Does anyone know how to make network output int instead of float?

I try to use tf.round to make elements in tensor convert to int, but then I meet this error:
ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable, check your graph for ops that do not support gradients, between variables ['Tensor("conv_w_0/read:0", shape=(9, 9, 1, 64), dtype=float32)', 'Tensor("conv_b_0/read:0", shape=(64,), dtype=float32)', 'Tensor("conv_w_1/read:0", shape=(1, 1, 64, 32), dtype=float32)', 'Tensor("conv_b_1/read:0", shape=(32,), dtype=float32)', 'Tensor("conv_w_2/read:0", shape=(5, 5, 32, 1), dtype=float32)', 'Tensor("conv_b_2/read:0", shape=(1,), dtype=float32)'] and loss Tensor("Mean:0", shape=(), dtype=float32).
And this is my  code:
Loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.l2_loss(tf.round(Train_output) * Train_tao / 2 + Train_img_LR[:,6:27,6:27,:] - Train_img_HR))
I just want to transfer the elements in Train_output from float to int, Train_output is my network's output.
I have an idea is that I can add a binary_step activation to the end of my model, but I don't know how to write it, because tensor is not iterable, can anyone help me?
