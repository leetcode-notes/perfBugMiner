Error: Data loss: file is too short to be an sstable

Hi there,
I'm training the Language Model code available here: https://github.com/rafaljozefowicz/lm
I am getting a "Data loss" error, see below for a traceback call. I was able to find the file where the error is raised, but I am having some trouble understanding exactly what is going wrong. It seems like this is related to a checkpoint file need to populate tensorboard, however I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction, so I may resolve this issue.
Currently, when I look at TensorBoard, I see a global_step of 0 for the entire training duration, and I'm worried that the model is not running. All of my GPUs are fully utilized, and I have no other issues.
