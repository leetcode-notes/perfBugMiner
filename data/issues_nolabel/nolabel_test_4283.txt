Breaking API change without deprecation warning

Problem
The name_scope API has changed between last week and last night's latest changes in the 0.10 branch. The previous API was:
name_scope(*args, **kwds)

The current API is:
name_scope(name)

The API was changed in a breaking way, rather than the new API being added and the use of the old API triggering a warning.
I was wondering what the TensorFlow gatekeepers' policy is on breaking API changes. Is there an official policy? Is the breaking change without a deprecation warning and phase-out intentional?
