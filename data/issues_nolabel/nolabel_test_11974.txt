tf.reshape does not accept Dimension objects for the shape parameter

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 x64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):  1.2.1
Python version: 3.6.1 (Anaconda 4.4.0 64-bit)
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:

Exact command to reproduce: tf.reshape()

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
tf.reshape does not accept a list with mixed Integer and Dimension() as elements for the shape parameter. It should accept shapes that have Dimension as elements since tensor shapes consist of dimensions. Specifically, tf.tensor.shape returns a list of Dimensions, therefore using a similar object to specify a shape in tf.reshape should not cause an error.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Example code:
X = tf.placeholder("float", [1,784])
X = tf.reshape(X, [1, X.shape[-1]])

results in
TypeError: Failed to convert object of type <class 'list'> to Tensor. Contents: [1, Dimension(784)]. Consider casting elements to a supported type.

This is rectified by casting X.shape[-1] to int before passing to tf.reshape.
A similar unrelated issue is that X.shape returns (784,) while it should return (1,784). This requires reshaping to turn the placeholder back into a 2D tensor. I haven't determined if this is a bug but it occurs when the tensor is explicitly specified as a 2D tensor so it is probably worth changing.
