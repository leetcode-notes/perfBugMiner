About the code
I just run the example code mnist_with_summries.py
it is in D:\Anaconda\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\examples\tutorials\mnist\mnist_with_summaries.py
What have you tried?
I can see a log file called events.out.tfevents.*  in the folder I set. The file is about 16Mb big.
I call tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/logs/mnist_with_summaries --debug and I can verify the log dir is correct.
On the browser I can't see any data or graph is shown.
If I call tensorboard --inspect --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/logs/mnist_with_summaries  It shows how  the tfevent file contains.
