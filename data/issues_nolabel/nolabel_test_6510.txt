Tensorflow0.08+cuda7.5+cudnn v4, GPU is not used as wished

I have installed Tensorflow0.08+cuda7.5+cudnn v4 by Anaconda installation. However, when I was training the DDPG network, I found that the speed was rather slow and the computation was mainly done in CPU instead of GPU. Hope someone can help me out.
