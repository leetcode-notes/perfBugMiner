strip_unused on TensorFlow 0.10.0rc0 outputs ImportError: No module named tools

Environment info
Operating System: Mac OS X El Capitan
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: N/A
Installed from binary pip package, TensorFlow version is 0.10.0rc0.
Python 2.7.11
Steps to reproduce

git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:strip_unused
I got the same error as in step 3 (shown in Logs below) when running the full command with the Inception V3 or V1 model. This is with the V3 model:

bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused --input_graph=/tmp/tensorflow_inception_graph_v3.pb --output_graph=/tmp/stripped_graph.pb --input_node_names=Mul --output_node_names=softmax --input_binary=true
What have you tried?

I tried the same procedure previously on TensorFlow 0.8.0 on a different Mac (also running OS X El Capitan), and the above commands work perfectly: the strip_unused itself without any parameters outputs Input graph file '' does not exist! and the full command outputs the stripped data model.
I took a look at the strip_unused_lib.py file, unable to be imported when running strip_unused, on github and saw it's created first on Aug. 7:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commits/master/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused_lib.py
I also looked at a similar issue: #3881 but it doesn't solve my problem.
I tried to add . to PYTHONPATH before running bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused and still got the same error.
I did a fresh new install of TensorFlow 0.10.0rc0 on another Mac OS X El Capitan, and it's still the same.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
