How to install with GLIBC_2.12?

I install it directly with conda
And get "version `GLIBC_2.17' not found,required by _pywrap_tensorflow.so"
I use LD_PRELOAD to load GLIBC_2.17
And get "__vdso_time: invalid mode for dlopen(): Invalid argument"
I try to install from the source, but bazel require GLIBC_2.14
What should I do?

uname -a
Linux mu01 2.6.32-358.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Jan 29 11:47:41 EST 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

and the version of glibc is 2.12
