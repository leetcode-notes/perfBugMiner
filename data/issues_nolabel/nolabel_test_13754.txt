graph_editor uses deprecated API

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.12
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): b'v1.3.0-21-gc701d19b2' 1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: See below

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
When I use graph_editor, my console fills up with dozens of repetitions of the following error message:
WARNING:tensorflow:VARIABLES collection name is deprecated, please use GLOBAL_VARIABLES instead; VARIABLES will be removed after 2017-03-02.

The number of repetitions of the message scales with the number of tensors being copied and can get very large.  To reproduce the problem, run the script below.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)
a = x+1
replace = {tf.convert_to_tensor(x):tf.convert_to_tensor(y)}
b = tf.contrib.graph_editor.graph_replace(a, replace)
