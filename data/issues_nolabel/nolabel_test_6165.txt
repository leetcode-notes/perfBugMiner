accelerate crf_log_norm

the base crf_log_norm function looks very cool, but it runs very slow.
I run the experiment on cpu
model name  : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v3 @ 2.30GHz

I use the configure
batch_size=128
max_seq_len=200
it runs 0.5s per batch
when I optimize the realization way
it  runs 0.25s per batch
