[XLA/tfcompile] Various fixes for MSVC Part 1

This is the initial work to solve #15213. More changes will come in other PRs.


tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests/make_test_graphs.py: Use os.path for path manipulation.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/array.h: Explicitly include <numeric> for std::accumulate.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/cpu/external_constant_pool.{cc,h}: Use tensorflow::port::Aligned{Malloc,Free}.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/cpu/llvm_ir_runtime.cc: Fix std::array initialization.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/cpu/simple_orc_jit.cc: Remove unused <dlfcn.h> and polyfill sincos[f] for MSVC.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/heap_simulator.h: Add const to custom comparator.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/status_macros.h: Use simplified version of TF_ASSIGN_OR_RETURN for MSVC. The simplified version also works for GCC as well actually.


tensorflow/compiler/xla/util.h: Hide the workaround for GCC 7 from MSVC's eyes.


tensorflow/core/lib/gtl/compactptrset.h: Define ssize_t for MSVC.


tensorflow/core/platform/macros.h: Define LANG_CXX11 for >= VS 2015. In MSVC, __cplusplus == 199711 even when /std:c++latest is set because MSVC is still not "fully" C++11 compliant.
