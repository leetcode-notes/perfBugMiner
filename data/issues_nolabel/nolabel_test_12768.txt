Removing /contrib/tensorboard and its references

The only reference to /contrib/tensorboard was in /contrib/init.py and /contrib/keras/python/keras/callbacks.py.
Both of those references did not include and tensorboard plugins that the Tensorboard repo does not have. So I have added multiple if-exists statements inside /keras/callbacks.py and removed /contrib/tensorboard completely.
The reason for this, some guy at Arch Linux repos have added a "rm -rf" to his PKGBUILD and now me and anybody who has the latest version of Tensorflow on Arch Linux is unable to use it. I thought maybe we can clear up the confusion since Kenser will be included with Tensorflow by default.
