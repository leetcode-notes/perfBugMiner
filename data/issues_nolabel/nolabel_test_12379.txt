[Feature] InputStream variant for ReadBinaryProto and ReadTextProto

System information

Describe the problem
Currently in master branch both ReadBinaryProto and ReadTextProto accepts only file path to load model proto, while in some cases we may want to load from a network stream or any other input stream of model proto file that input stream is our best option.
So I think adding two variants accepts stream input instead of file path should be good. As both these ReadBinaryProto and ReadTextProto are in C++ public API, may I know is it feasible to add? Or any other security or implementation difficulty that is blocking it? Or design conflict?
If it is just lacking of people, sure I can help.
