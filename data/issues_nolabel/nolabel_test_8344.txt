Doesn't inefficient and unfriendly for Distributed tensorflow for our model training?

If we want deployed tensorflow on our cluster, it is really inefficient in my opinion. As the official tutorial shows, how many task you have launched, then how many times you should run you program file on those nodes.
As our developers hope, tensorflow will be our Hadoop in Deep Learning. Hadoop to launch an job would be more convenient just execute once your job command.
Maybe I doesn't use this framework correctly, if you have any good ideas for this, we can discussed an nice solution and make our world beautiful.
