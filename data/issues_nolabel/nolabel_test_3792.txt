Fix Eigen-related compilation error when using -mavx2.

Since updating to use a newer version of Eigen [1], compilation with
-mavx2 causes an error caused by an undefined type. Eigen removed
the type scalar_multipl2_op [2] so scalar_product_op should now
be used.
This commit replaces uses of scalar_multiple2_op similarly to how
[2] did this.
