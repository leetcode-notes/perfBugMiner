remove some signed/unsigned integer comparison warnings

Jenkins, test this please.
I saw some areas where -1 was used as marker, so I didn't try to change those.  A lot of the dimensions specified the dimensions had to be positive.  I wanted to try running tests locally, but I get the following error message:
bazel test ...
/clipped/
ERROR: /usr/local/lib/bazel/base_workspace/tools/BUILD:7:1: no such package 'tools/android': BUILD file not found on package path and referenced by '//tools:srcs'.
ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.
____Elapsed time: 5.022s
ERROR: Couldn't start the build. Unable to run tests.
This is as much as asking for how to run the test locally as the pull request itself.  Reference #128
