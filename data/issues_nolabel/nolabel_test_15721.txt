Is it possible to have labels for outputs( I found it on the documentation)

For example, currently if I want to run a graph with multiple output:
session.run([output1, output2], feed_dict = feed_dict)

which return a list of results. I would like to have a label for each result, so the code will look like:
session.run({label1: output1, label2: output2}, feed_dict = feed_dict)

which return a dictionary maps labels to results, so I can get specific result based on the output label.
