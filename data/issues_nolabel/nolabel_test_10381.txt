Clarify tf.matmul documentation

Maybe I'm confused about what "inner" and "outer" tensor dimensions are, but the documentation for tf.matmul puzzles me:

The inputs must be matrices (or tensors of rank > 2, representing
batches of matrices), with matching inner dimensions, possibly after
transposition.

Isn't it the case that R-rank arguments need to have matching (or no) R-2 outer dimensions, and that (as in normal matrix multiplication) the Rth, inner dimension of the first argument must match the R-1st dimension of the second. That is, in
A = tf.constant(..., shape=[a, ..., z, p, x])
B = tf.constant(..., shape=[a', ..., z', x', q]) 
C = tf.matmul(A, B)

The outer dimensions a, ..., z must be identical to a', ..., z' (or not exist), and x and x' must match (while p and q can be anything).
Or put another way, shouldn't the docs say:

The inputs must, following any transpositions, be tensors of rank â‰¥ 2 where the inner 2 dimensions specify valid matrix multiplication arguments, and any further outer dimensions match.
