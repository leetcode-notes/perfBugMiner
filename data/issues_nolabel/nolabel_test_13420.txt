Fix bug: variables outside won't update in DNNLinearCombinedRegressor

This fix is an proposal for #13419
What changes were proposed in this pull request?
There are two solutions to fix the problem in my opinion:

all variables except of linear is optimized by dnn.
which one of optimizers does the variables left (except of linear and dnn) use is selected by user, perhaps a new argument is needed.

The PR is implemented by the first one for simplicity.
How to test

 add test case: I have no idea of how to write it, hence any suggestions will be appreciated.
 pass all tests.
