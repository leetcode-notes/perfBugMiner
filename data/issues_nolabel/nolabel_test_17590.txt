Leak when creating many tf.layers.Conv2D with tf.eager

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16.04.3 LTS


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  binary


TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.5.0-0-g37aa430d84', '1.5.0')


Python version: Python 3.5.2


CUDA/cuDNN version:  cuda-9.0


GPU model and memory: TITAN X (Pascal)


Exact command to reproduce:


see gist https://gist.github.com/matpalm/93680534c5c53d6e7836d3aea1a3bbb3
for minimal reproduction. run this script and watch loop times increase.
Describe the problem
each creation of a tf.layers.Conv2D is slower than the one before. have a project based on evolutionary algorithm that creates many instances of tf.layers.Conv2D for fitness evaluation and over time entire process slows down. it's not expected this loop should slow down.
