tensorflow-gpu pip package is not compatible with cuda9 docker image

System information

No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary (pip install tensorflow-gpu)
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.6.0

Exact command to reproduce:
I was trying to build a horovod image, but this would affect anyone using the nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04 base image:

docker build -t horovod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber/horovod/master/Dockerfile
docker run -it --rm horovod python tensorflow_mnist.py
Describe the problem
When building a docker image based on nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04 and doing a pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.6.0, the resulting image causes a crash because the base image contains cuDNN 7.1, while the tensorflow-gpu pip package was built against cuDNN 7.0.
