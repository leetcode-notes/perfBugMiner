C++ model Saving(after training) not generating 'modelName.meta' file for Prediction

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 6.0.3
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

session->Run({{"save/Const:0", newModelFile}}, {}, {"save/control_dependency"}, nullptr)
Describe the problem
I am trying to train a model file in C++ and save the trained model file.
when I save the model file with below command in C++
session->Run({{"save/Const:0", 'newModelFile'}}, {}, {"save/control_dependency"}, nullptr)
Following files are generated

newModelFile.index
newModelFile.data-00000-of-00001

But when the training and saving is done in Python with below command
with tf.Session() as sess:
    tf.train.Saver(tf.trainable_variables()).save(sess, 'newModelFile')


Following files are getting generated

newModelFile.index
newModelFile.data-00000-of-00001
newModelFile.meta

As we can see 'newModelFile.meta' is not getting generated in C++
Requirement - To do prediction in C++ from trained model file (in C++)
I have found the code in C++ which meets the above requirement at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35508866/tensorflow-different-ways-to-export-and-run-graph-in-c/43639305#43639305
BUT
the code makes use of 'newModelFile.meta' file which is not generated during training in C++

Can I please know how to generate 'newModelFile.meta' file in C++ to use it for prediction
Is there any other way to make predictions in c++ from the checkpoint files
Is there a way to generate .pb in c++ after training instead of generating checkpoint files so that it can directly be loaded for prediction
