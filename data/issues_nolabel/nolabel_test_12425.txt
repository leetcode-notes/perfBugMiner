Feature: TF on mix environnment CPU-GPU

When using TF-GPU, either switches to GPU depending on GPU availability.
When we have a mixed environnment,
CPU +GPU, it would be better to distribute across CPU and GPU available,
specify the core available to TF for full usage (keeping one for centralized processing).
