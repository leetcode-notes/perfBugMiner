Recursively copying elements from one graph to another

Allows for easy portability of elements (Variables and Ops) from one Tensorflow Graph to another. If called on a top-level root in a dataflow graph, automatically copies all required instances.
Provides an API to retrieve the copied elements in the other graph, using a namespace.
