Upgrade Tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl on Windows and get warning

I upgrade Tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl, CPU version on Windows server 2012 R2
pip install --upgrade
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-win/85/DEVICE=cpu,OS=windows/artifact
/cmake_build/tf_python/dist/tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
It shows
"Successfully installed tensorflow-1.0.0rc2 werkzeug-0.11.15"
But I get the following warning when I run the hello example, please advise what's the problem.
