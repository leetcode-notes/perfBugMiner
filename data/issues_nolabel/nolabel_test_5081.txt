why there are so many different versions for models?

I am confused about the versions of tensor flow models. There are at lease 3.

This one i can call as main folder.

https://github.com/tensorflow/models

Another one is inside of the main folder is called slim and it has instructions about how to use, such as train_image_classifier.py , which currently i am using. I do not need write more code, just input some parameters.

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim

the second slim is in the folder blow, which provide different instructions as above slim.  It seems that I must write additional python code to make it work. And the learning.py under this slim folder is different from above train_image_classifier.py.

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim

Is there any necessity to provide so many branches or versions?  I guess they belong to different teams? Is there any consensus (internally) about which is the major one? This may not be a technical issue but a political issue.
