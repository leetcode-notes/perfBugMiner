gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '--config=opt'

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): release 0.9.0- (@non-git)
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Using built-in specs.
COLLECT_GCC=gcc
COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/local/stow/gcc-4.9.2/libexec/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.9.2/lto-wrapper
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Configured with: /usr/src/nfs/gcc-4.9.2/configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/gcc-4.9.2
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.9.2 (GCC)
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: x86_64 GNU/Linux
Exact command to reproduce:  bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
