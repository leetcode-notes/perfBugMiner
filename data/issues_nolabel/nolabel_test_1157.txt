Still seeing 'missing dependency declarations' when building with Bazel 0.1.4/0.1.5

I'm still getting the error from #469, even with the fix in #788.
Debian, gcc 4.9.2, bazel 0.1.5 (tried 0.1.4 as well with the same results).
Command line:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --verbose_failures --spawn_strategy=standalone  //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

Error output:
