Install new TensorFlow via anaconda, but failed

Hello,
When I tried to install TensorFlow via anaconda.
I`ve searched the suitable cite to submit the issue, but failed to find out it.
If this is not sorry for it and advice me.
The target os is 'windows 10', and via anaconda 5.0.1 For Windows (Python 3.6 version 64bit).
After intall anaconda, from my terminal 'cmd.exe',
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6
but received an error message.
But from 'Anaconda Prompt' below 'Anaconda3' of 'start button',it works correctly.
Thus I recommend to include the following description,
start 'Anaconda Prompt' below 'Anaconda3' of 'start button' between the steps.
