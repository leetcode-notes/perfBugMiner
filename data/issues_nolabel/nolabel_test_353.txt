cifar10 speed numbers

In the comments of cifar10_train.py, it says:
Accuracy:
cifar10_train.py achieves ~86% accuracy after 100K steps (256 epochs of
data) as judged by cifar10_eval.py.

Speed: With batch_size 128.

System        | Step Time (sec/batch)  |     Accuracy
------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Tesla K20m  | 0.35-0.60              | ~86% at 60K steps  (5 hours)
1 Tesla K40m  | 0.25-0.35              | ~86% at 100K steps (4 hours)

The math doesn't look right to me:
5 x 60 x 60 / 60K=0.3 sec/batch
4 x 60 x 60 / 100K=0.144 sec/batch
Also, on my machine (K40c, 28 CPU cores, SSD) I can only reach about half the speed (~0.6 sec/batch). Any idea what might be the factor that slows it down? Thanks!
