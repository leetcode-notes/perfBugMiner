Import error with skflow

Hello,
I get an error when I try to import skflow with the command
from tensorflow.contrib import skflow
The error is "ImportError: cannot import name 'skflow". I have googled the error came across this similar issue: #1931. Apparently I have a lower version of tensorflow (I had 0.12) and need a newer version, such as 0.80.
I had done the installation by looking at this website (for cpu based): https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation-on-windows.
Probably only 0.12 is released for windows. Is there a way to get a higher version for Windows, or some workaround?
As a solution I have also separately installed skflow, but some of the functions are not there, as I see them in this tutorial: http://learningtensorflow.com/lesson8/, since it is an older version probably.
I am now trying to build tensorflow on my computer with cmake and MSBuild, but it also does not run smoothly. You can see the issue with that here: #6160
I have the following specs:

Windows 7, service pack 1, 64 bit
Python 3.5
Tensorflow 0.12

Thanks a lot,
Kerem
