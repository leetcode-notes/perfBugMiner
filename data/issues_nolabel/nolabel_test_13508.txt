Describe the problem
Hello,
I am currently trying to use the Dataset API with TFRecords. Using a (tested) dataset I made and refactoring working code, I wanted to switch from queues to Datasets. With the following code:
def parse_function(serialized_example):

    # Context features
    context_features = {
         "label": tf.FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.int64),
    }

    # Sequence features
    sequence_features = {
         "positions": tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature([], dtype=tf.string),
    }

    # Parsing the TFRecord
    context_parsed, sequence_parsed = tf.parse_single_sequence_example(
        serialized=serialized_example,
        context_features=context_features,
        sequence_features=sequence_features)

    label = tf.cast(context_parsed['label'], tf.int32)
    sequence = tf.decode_raw(sequence_parsed['positions'], tf.float32)

    return tf.reshape(sequence, [height, width, channels]), label

def main(_):
    dataset = tensorflow.contrib.data.TFRecordDataset("path")
    dataset.map(parse_function)
    dataset.batch(64)

    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    sequences, labels = iterator.get_next()
    ...

the last line will raise a TypeError("'Tensor' object is not iterable."). iterator.get_next() returns in this case a tensor with shape (), but I believe it should return a tuple of batched sequences and labels, as defined in my parse_function. I tried with every iterator, in or out of a session, but no change.
Is it a bug or am I doing something wrong? Examples from https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets#decoding_image_data_and_resizing_it
really suggest this is the way to go.
Thanks,
Quentin
