Write rules to construct headers for jpeg-turbo using existing templates.

Fixes #6442
Test build:
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Experimental/job/exp-win-bzl/8/console
Had to use a few hacks to get this fully working.
Bazel did not allow me to add a dict type with a selector.
It even did not let me use a selector in expand_template's substitutions field.
So I expanded the selector in genrule to accomodate simd/nosimd differences.
I think I can also get rid of my expand_template.bzl , and use expand_header_template in llvm.bzl.
But I am not sure how nice cross 3p usage. Maybe I can create a folder third_party/skylark and pull the skylark rules we are defining to that folder. Or simply third_party/common.bzl
Please let me know which looks nicer.
