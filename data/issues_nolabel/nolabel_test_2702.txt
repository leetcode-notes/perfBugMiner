API doc typo for tf.nn.avg_pool3d and tf.nn.max_pool3d

In the tensorflow API doc: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn.html#max_pool3d, it states:
ksize: A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D tensor of length 5. The size of the window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must have ksize[0] = ksize[1] = 1.
ksize[0] = ksize[1] = 1 must be ksize[0] = ksize[4] = 1 for both average and max pooling 3d layers as detailed here:
