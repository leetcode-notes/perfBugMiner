Feature request: Update OpDef proto to ease 1-based indexing

It would be nice if the OpDef proto included information on which inputs and attributes are indices, so that TensorFlow bindings for index-from-1 languages (like Julia) could automatically subtract 1 from the parameters of client calls that refer to those parameters.
Currently, the Julia binding has to rely on rough heuristics, like checking if the operation's input's type attribute is called "Tidx", to provide the conversion.
