Add int64 `Tdim` support for `ExpandDims`

This fix tries to add int64 Tdim support for ExpandDims.
In array_ops.cc, ExpandDims registers both int32 and int64 support for Tdim. However, only int32 kernel for ExpandDims has been supported.
This fix addresses the discrepancy by adding the support of int64 Tdim for ExpandDims.
Additional tests has also been added to cover the changes.
