TfLiteCameraDemo only contains 32-bit libtensorflowlite_jni.so

I strictly followed the steps on https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/ to
build the TfLiteCameraDemo. But I found only 32-bit libtensorflowlite_jni.so was contained in the final APK.
I modified the source code of libneuralnetworks.so to test my employer's NN accelerator, which needed the 64-bit libtensorflowlite_jni.so.
even I configed bazel with
./configure --config=android_arm64
and built with
bazel build --cxxopt=--std=c++11 --cpu=arm64-v8a //tensorflow/contrib/lite/java/demo/app/src/main:TfLiteCameraDemo
could not work.
Where was my mistake? Or how can I pack the 64-bit  libtensorflowlite_jni.so into the final APK?
