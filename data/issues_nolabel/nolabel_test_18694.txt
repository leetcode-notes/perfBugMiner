Update docs for tf.unstack with respect to numpy compatibility

In #18692 an issue was raised over whether tf.unstack is compatible with numpy.unstack(specified in existing docs) or numpy.split.
It looks like there is no numpy.unstack. And for numpy.split, it is not compatible with tf.unstack.
The tf.split is indeed very close to numpy.split. However, the second arg num_or_size_splits in tf.split requires the number of the splits, while the second arg indices_or_sections in numpy.split requires the index of the splits. For that reason the tf.split is not compatible with numpy.split as well.
According to the above this fix simply removes The numpy equivalent part in the docs of tf.unstack.
This fix fixes #18692.
