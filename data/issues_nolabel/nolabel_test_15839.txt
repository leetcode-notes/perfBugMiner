Problem in "/tensorflow/examples" project to build an android app

As we know, there will build three APP and one TF speech app in the 'tensorflow/examples'.
But, I just want to use the  detectorActivity to build an app, aim at to use this app to do a porject named 'Image Recognition'.
So I need to delete three other java file like ClassifierActivity、StylizeActivity、SpeechActvity and so on, and download the model that detectorActivity need. like this

But, when I choose to build apk, there was a problem that "Execution failed for task: downloadFile  org.apache.http.conn.ConnectTineoutException:......."
I use the windows and android studio to build this project.
Is anyone can help me to separate this example just retain the  detectorActivity  and use our's model in android:assets , to help me build an app to do 'Image Recognition' Project. Thx every friends
