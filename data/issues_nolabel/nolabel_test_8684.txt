Basic setup steps for contributing

There was no instructions on how to get set up and running tests.
(e.g. I found a bug in tensorflow and just want to fix it)

Edit: TODO:

 Setup instructions for non-MacOS users? (e.g. not necessary if setup script is OS-agnostic)
 System tests for setup instructions?
 bin/setup?
 bin/test? Would test all targets by default?
