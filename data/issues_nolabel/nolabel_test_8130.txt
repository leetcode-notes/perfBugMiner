TensorFlow 1.0 error messages point to broken link

When import tensorflow fails in TF 1.0, we print an error message containing the following text:
Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.

See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#import_error

for some common reasons and solutions. Include the entire stack trace above this error message when asking for help.

Unfortunately, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#import_error is a broken link. I realize this is probably because we've moved all the docs around, but is there some way we could leave a breadcrumb there for our unfortunate users?
The proper link should include the r1.0 branch: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#import_error
