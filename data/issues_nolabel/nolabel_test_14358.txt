Not found Op type not registered 'CountExtremelyRandomStats'

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS sierra 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel-bin/tensorflow_serving/model_servers/tensorflow_model_server --port=9000 --model_name=rf_quora --model_base_path=/serving/rf_model &> rf_log &

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I am getting the following error while running bazel command in the docker container.
command ran :-
bazel-bin/tensorflow_serving/model_servers/tensorflow_model_server --port=9000 --model_name=rf_quora --model_base_path=/serving/rf_model &> rf_log &error:- Not found: Op type not registered 'CountExtremelyRandomStats' in binary running on 864822af1c6c. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.
I tried my search with the following link but in vain. #11847
I am trying to do inference using tensorflow tensorserving, but I am getting blocked by the above error.
Using Tensorflow 1.3 and using tensor_forest api present in tf.contrib.tensor_forest_python.
Can anyone help me with this error as it is blocking my testing. Note:- I have successfully ran tensorserving inference for mnist and inception examples models.
