Run Retrained inception model

I have trained tensorflow inception v3 model with new data sets. (on ubuntu)
I got output_graph.pb and output_labels.txt files in tmp folder.
When I tried to run as below
python label_image.py --image /home/ubuntu/140924_HDR3DSC_0092_ISO00050_SS1250.JPG --graph /tmp/output_graph.pb --labels /tmp/output_labels.txt
I got below errors
File "label_image.py", line 121, in 
input_operation = graph.get_operation_by_name(input_name);
File "/home/ubuntu/tensorflow/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2836, in get_operation_by_name
return self.as_graph_element(name, allow_tensor=False, allow_operation=True)
File "/home/ubuntu/tensorflow/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2708, in as_graph_element
return self._as_graph_element_locked(obj, allow_tensor, allow_operation)
File "/home/ubuntu/tensorflow/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2768, in _as_graph_element_locked
"graph." % repr(name))
KeyError: "The name 'import/input' refers to an Operation not in the graph."
Please suggest me what to do to resolve this.
Please suggest me if anything wrong from my end.
