Improve documentation of tf.gfile.GFile vs tf.gfile.FastGFile

is not clear from the docs what is the difference between the two.
I assumed that one has thread locking (.GFile) and the other does not, but both say the same thing in the docs:

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gfile/GFile
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gfile/FastGFile
