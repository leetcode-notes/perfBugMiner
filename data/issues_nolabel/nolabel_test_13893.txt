Update protobuf.cmake to b04e5cba356212e4e8c66c61bbe0c3a20537c5b9

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #8187 where protobuf.cmake used different version as bazel.
The reason for discrepancy was due to the fact that a customerized protobuf was needed with Windows patch. Since the patch has been merged in (google/protobuf#2203), it makes sense to update protobuf.cmake so that the same version of cmake is used.
This fix fixes #8187.
