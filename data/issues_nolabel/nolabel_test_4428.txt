Slim Tutorial and Script broken due to Commit 8d1b23d999a563c56236a3d250e18ef825e4e66e

Hey TF Team,
Commit 8d1b23d broke the TF Slim Tutorial and TF Slim Script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/scripts/finetune_inception_v3_on_flowers.sh
Reverting this file to 4d24144 solves the issue 4d24144#diff-197163b98ebda1e22c3ff820582bf0d5
In the latest TF version as well as the TF rc10 the TF Slim Image Classification is not running.
Tested on Offical Tensorflow Docker GPU Image.
Best Wishes,
Patrick
