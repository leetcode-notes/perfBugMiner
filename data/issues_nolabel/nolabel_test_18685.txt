XLA CPU Fft no core framework and single thread

See #18588
Does two things:

Fixes the XLA CPU implementation of the fast fourier transform to avoid reliance on the tf core framework.
Allows AOT compilation of FFT to single-threaded environments.

See the linked issue for a longer discussion. I ran the randomized_tests.cc suite and it passed with --tf_xla_test_use_jit=false --tf_xla_test_device=CPU:0. None of the tests (neither my changes nor any other ops) would run with --tf_xla_test_use_jit=true; I don't know if that's a problem with my setup.
Happy to make changes.
