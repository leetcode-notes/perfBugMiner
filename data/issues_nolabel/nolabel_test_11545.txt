add nodouble option for all cwise ops

this is the following patch of ac98d11 to support nodouble
option for all cwise ops. The macros REGISTER* defined within
ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM should be changed to empty, and it impacts
all the cwise ops, so, all the changes for the cwise ops have to be
in a single patch.
there will be more patches for other ops to support nodouble option.
