Some of the issues when searching for "import tensorflow as tf" gave answers related to either mock not being installed correctly or protobuf.  In my case, all were installed correctly and successfully.

Operating System:
Amazon Linux
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
I installed a CPU only version.  So no CUDA
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
the installation completed successfully.  Here is the output:
