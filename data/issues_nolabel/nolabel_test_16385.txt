Describe the problem
If I create a model with tf.keras, compile it and then turn it into an estimator by simply passing it thru to tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator, I am able to train and evaluate the model just fine -- however when I got to export it with Estimator.export_savedmodel, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "endtoend_noweights_trainer_keras.py", line 302, in <module>
    get_serving_input_fn(hyperparameters),
  File "/home/u1/zach/proj/dataplayground2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py", line 517, in export_savedmodel

    raise ValueError('export_outputs must be a dict.')
ValueError: export_outputs must be a dict.

I'm not sure what export_outputs is, but if I had to guess it should be a mapping of output names to output tensors from the keras model.
Here's the (very unclean) code I'm using to get to this, although there's a lot of dependencies that won't work for y'all. If you need a repro I can take the time to put it together, just let me know. Notably the error occurs on line 300.
