docker image for 1.6.0 is missing CUPTI libraries

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04, 4.4.0-104-generic
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version: v1.6.0-0-gd2e24b6 1.6.0
Bazel version: N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0.176 (from docker image)
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX TITAN X
Exact command to reproduce: (see below)

Describe the Error
CUPTI library is missing in docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:1.6.0-gpu-py3. This is required when using trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE and run_metadata in session.run.
Source code / logs
To reproduce:

# run.py
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session().as_default() as sess:
    test_op = tf.no_op()

    run_options = tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
    run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()
    sess.run(test_op, options=run_options, run_metadata=run_metadata)

And run:
> nvidia-docker run --volume /path/to/run.py:/run.py --rm -it tensorflow/tensorflow:1.6.0-gpu-py3 python /run.py
The error message is:

2018-03-05 00:00:00.000000: I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:141] Couldn't open CUDA library libcupti.so.9.0. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64

Additional information from within the docker image:

> echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64
> ll /usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64
ls: cannot access '/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64': No such file or directory

(not found)

The library seems to be missing in this build. Worked with tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.0-gpu-py3.
