bazel-bin command not found

I am having issues while building pip package.I am building tensorflow with cpu configurations Steps i followed
bazel release= 0.4.5, ubuntu -version = 14.04 LTS

bazel clean
./configure
bazel build --config op

kush@kush-Lenovo-B40-80:~/machine_learning/deeplearning/tensorflow$ bazel build --config=op
Warning: ignoring LD_PRELOAD in environment.
WARNING: Config values are not defined in any .rc file: op
INFO: Found 0 targets...
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.365s, Critical Path: 0.03s



Now when i try to run
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

kush@kush-Lenovo-B40-80:~/machine_learning/deeplearning/tensorflow$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package
bash: bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package: No such file or directory

But then i tried sudo it gives
sudo: bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package: command not found
bazel is installed in my system. i have checked it.
I also tried giving full path in bazel-bin
sudo: /usr/bin/bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package: command not found
i have bazel release = 0.4.5
Can anyone help me on this?
