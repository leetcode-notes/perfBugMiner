Fix crash in `tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_video`

This fix fixes the crash in tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_video. The reason for the crash was that, decode_video dumps the information about streaming etc. (as opposed to dump
to stderr) info a file and read from it. As the loglevel was error the file was empty.
This fix addresses the issue.
The fix could be verifed by manually running
bazel test -s --config=opt --cache_test_results=no \
        //tensorflow/contrib/ffmpeg:decode_video_op_test

With this fix, the above test works.
