Linux CPU smoke tests failing due to merged API change

This commit appears to break the Linux CPU tests (at least for me).  It seems that when the smoke tests passed for this commit, the Linux CPU tests didn't include the api_compatibility_test, but now they do.  However, the golden API and the real API have already diverged, so there isn't any possibility of successful passing any more.
