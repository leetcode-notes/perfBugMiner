conv2d_transpose cannot be used in network with variable batch size

I'm building a network that requires an approximate deconvolution using conv2d_transpose and I'm running into this error when constructing the network:
...
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py", line 80, in conv2d_transpose
    output_shape_ = ops.convert_to_tensor(output_shape, name="output_shape")
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 530, in convert_to_tensor
    ret = conversion_func(value, dtype=dtype, name=name, as_ref=as_ref)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/constant_op.py", line 195, in _tensor_shape_tensor_conversion_function
    "Cannot convert a partially known TensorShape to a Tensor: %s" % s)
ValueError: Cannot convert a partially known TensorShape to a Tensor: (?, 40, 40, 32)

It appears that the operation doesn't support shape objects with none values as they cannot be converted to tensors. Is there a workaround? Or should I simply explicitly set my batch size for now?
edit: It appears that reshape has the same issue.
