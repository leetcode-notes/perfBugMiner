Describe the problem
When using Tensorflow's Estimator to do predictions, the Estimator always loads the checkpoint in the model_dir. As this is done after the model_fn is called, there is no way to partially load a checkpoint for predictions. For training, I partially load the initial checkpoint in the model_fn which works fine.
I also tried not specifying the model_dir for the Estimator. As the documentation states, this results in the Estimator using a temporary folder. However, as the temporary folder does not contain a checkpoint, I get the error Could not find trained model in model_dir.
It looks like there is no way to only partially load a checkpoint for prediction. If so, please provide a way to do this. For me, this is important, because I have a large model with several outputs. For different datasets, some of the outputs have different sizes. However, some of them are the same for all datasets. That's why I want to load them with the same code and only partially, because I don't need to load and run the whole network for this prediction.
