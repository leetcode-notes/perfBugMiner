Feature Request - Session Cancellation Function

It'd be great to have a between node cancellation function for the tensorflow python session. In particular, if you call sess.cancel_graph() on a separate thread, then the tensorflow session on the main thread would be cancelled (raising an exception like the timeout exception). It would also be great for these cancellation signals to be caught between every tf operation, rather than only after particular operations like dequeue, etc.
