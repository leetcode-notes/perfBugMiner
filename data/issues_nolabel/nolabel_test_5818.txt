[Windows] DepthwiseConv2DNative not available

The DepthwiseConv2DNative op (and some related ops for backprop) are currently excluded from the Windows build (CMake reference, Bazel reference). This is causing issues for models that use these ops (e.g. fchollet/keras#4478).
We should figure out why it doesn't build and fix it.
