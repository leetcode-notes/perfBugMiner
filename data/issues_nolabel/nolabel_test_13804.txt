Figure out CUDA and cuDNN versions

So I'm setting up an image for a group to be used in the cloud.
Given that there certain cloud related things which we don't have premissions to we want to be able to verify that Tensorflow is using indeed what we intended. However, there does not seem to be any comprehensive way of understanding at the moment what exactly is it using. The output after creating a session is:

Does this means the cuda fails since I don't see any "succesffully loaded libcuda..." or anthing like that. Does it even load cuDNN? Is there any way to directly check it (once is enough don't need to be printed every time.
I did not find any documentations and there was not too much here in the issues except people not beeing able to do it.
