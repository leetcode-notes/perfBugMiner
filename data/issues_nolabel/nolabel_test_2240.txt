Will it conflict installing by soucecode ,with installing by pip

I have install tensorflow by pip.
And Because I have to add some code in tensorflow ,so I need to build tensorflow by sourcecode.
And when run bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
it will report
configure: error: zlib not installed
Target //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer failed to build
Use --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.743s, Critical Path: 2.24s
But in fact ,I have install zlib.
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.743s, Critical Path: 2.24s
[@sjs_88_31 tensorflow]# yum install zlib
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile

epel: mirrors.neusoft.edu.cn
_Package zlib-1.2.7-13.el7.x86_64 already installed and latest version
_Nothing to do
So how can I fixed it?
My Os is cenos7.1.

And how can i add souce files if just only using pip install?
