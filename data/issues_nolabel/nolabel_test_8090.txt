fused_batch_norm doesn't work with epsilon < 1e-5

This line in nn_impl.py has the following comment: "Add 1e-12 to epsilon when epsilon <= 1e-5 to prevent CUDNN exception." However, I still get the cuDNN exception when using values of epsilon less than 1e-5.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf
from itertools import chain

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
        x = tf.zeros([4, 4, 4, 4])
        scale, offset = tf.ones(4), tf.zeros(4)

        y, _, _ = tf.nn.fused_batch_norm(x, scale, offset, mean=None, variance=None, epsilon=1e-8,
                data_format='NCHW', is_training=True)

        init_op = tf.group(*(v.initializer for v in chain(tf.global_variables(),
                tf.local_variables())))

        sess = tf.Session()
        sess.run(init_op)
        sess.run(y)
