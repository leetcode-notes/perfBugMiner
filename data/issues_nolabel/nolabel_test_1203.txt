Unable to safely terminate tensor flow running on gpu

I have implement a network using tensorflow on a Nvidia GPU. Even after I call sess.close(), the program won't stop. When I hit ctrl+c for termination, the program crashes the nvidia driver and creates a zombie process named "python". I am not able to kill the zombie process, neither can I reboot ubuntu system by sudo reboot.
Is this a known issue? Please help!
