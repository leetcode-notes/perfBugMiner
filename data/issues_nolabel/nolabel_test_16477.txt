Windows Installation tutorial has wrong cuda version requirement, 9.0 required for latest version.

I just ran the installation validation and it's telling me I need 9.0, the tutorial says we must use 8.0. I don't have cheap access to Internet, now I have to find 1GB+ plus of data without paying $15 to use my phone's data. Please update the page to recommend 9.0.
Thank you.
