In my town people obsess about digital life. Every passing conversation is couched in software vernacular. Enthusiasm for the unrealized potential of information automation is explained as an ever expanding frontier. Technology has brought us great fortune but even greater things in common. For every fan of Larry Ellison there are twenty aspiring Zuckerbergs. People who visualize technology not just as intellectual property, but as an expanding commons. While tech serfdom abounds in the libertarian haven of Silicon Valley there are those whose fantasy is a digital utopia.
