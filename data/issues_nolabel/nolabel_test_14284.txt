Estimator from Keras by model_to_estimator cannot export

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.12
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4 or Master

Describe the problem
when calling model_to_estimator, the model_fn create by _create_keras_model_fn didn't set export_outputs in the returned EstimatorSpec, see this. That make it unable to export to SavedModel, the following error raised when call estimator.export_savedmodel()
packages/tensorflow/python/estimator/export/export.py", line 193, in build_all_signature_defs
    raise ValueError('export_outputs must be a dict.')
ValueError: export_outputs must be a dict.

I would like contrib a PR for fixing this if is OK
