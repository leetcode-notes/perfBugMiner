TensorFlow Implementation in MapReduce

Hello guys,
First, i'm sorry if i break the rules. But, i really stuck right now. So, this is my last hope to ask this question.
I just want to ask something. Can i implement TensorFlow in MapReduce Programming Model within Hadoop ?
Yes, i know that TensorFlow can be runned in distributed mode, according this reference https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/distributed/ . But, it doesn't explain more detail how to use it in MapReduce.
One last thing, can i use TensorFlow to predict something a lot of data ? Because, i only know that TensorFlow can be used to classify similar images.
I'm sorry if my question look dumb. Well, there are many thing in the world that i don't know. So, when i don't know, i will ask a question ðŸ˜„
Thanks for your attention
