Tensor slice is too large to serialize

Hi,
I met a issue said that "Tensor slice is too large to serialize (conservative estimate: 2268204567 bytes)". And i am wondered that why there is a limitation to prevents the TensorSliceWriter from attempting to serialize variables that are larger than 2GB. How can I to skip this limitation if I want to use a variable large than 2GB?
Thanks
