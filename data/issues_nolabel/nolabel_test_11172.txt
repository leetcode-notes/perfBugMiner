[XLA] Ensure that the 2 data types chosen by the test are both valid for the device

Simple change.  The test previously assumed that all devices support float64, which isn't true for our device.
Now the test will find 2 different floating point types and use those.  Doesn't execute if there are not 2 floating point types to choose from.
