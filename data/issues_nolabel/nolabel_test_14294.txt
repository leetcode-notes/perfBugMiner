Compilation progress indicator is useless

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master from around now
Python version:  -
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Apple LLVM 9.0.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce: Any compilation, e.g. bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Whenever I compile Tensorflow, Bazel shows a nice progress indicator, for example:
[1,428 / 1,437] Compiling tensorflow/core/kernels/cast_op_impl_int64.cc

However that progress proceeds something like this:
[4 / 15]
[20 / 26]
...
[264 / 275]
...
[1,821 / 1,832]
...
[3,456 / 3,470]

Pretty useless. Compiling Tensorflow takes about 45 minutes on my system and it seems to want to do a complete recompile at the drop of a hat so it would be useful at least if I know whether I should wait for it or go and cook dinner. Is there anything that could be done to improve this?
