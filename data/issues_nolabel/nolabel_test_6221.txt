Delete zombie code

seq2seq_test.py was deleted in cl/141309717 but added back by a
GitHub sync due to a bug where files deleted in perforce are not
deleted in the GitHub repository.


status_helper.i was not referenced by any rules and appears to be
dead code in the truest sense.


jpeg.BUILD was moved to third_party/jpeg.BUILD a while back.
