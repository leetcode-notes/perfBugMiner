Add cumsum and cumprod ops

This implements tf.scan_sum (cumulative sum) and tf.scan_prod (cumulative product) ops.
Unfortunately, this won't compile with the current version of eigen, as I have to make some small changes to TensorScanOp.h
But this should be useful to discuss how the API should look and whether we want to have inclusive/exclusive ops, and so on.
I'll also add tests and gradients to the two ops.
This relates to #813.
