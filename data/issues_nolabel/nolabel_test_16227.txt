Describe the problem
In tf.contrib.factorization.KMeansClustering, the TensorFlow 1.4 version of the KMeans Estimator (previous version), the export_savedmodel function throws an error:
ValueError: export_outputs must be a dict and not<type 'NoneType'>
As far as I can tell, the older version used the function here to populate export_outputs from the prediction values. The newer version does not do this, rendering it impossible to create a saved model. Instead the model_fn returns an EstimatorSpec with no export_outputs.
To replicate the issue, create and train a simple contrib.factorization.KMeansClustering Estimator and try to save it.
kmeans = tf.contrib.factorization.KMeansClustering(num_clusters = num_clusters)
kmeans.train(input_fn = inputFn)
kmeans.export_savedmodel(export_dir, exportFn)
