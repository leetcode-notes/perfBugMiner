Is it possible to call TensorBoard smooth function manually?

I have two arrays X and Y.
Is there a function I can call in tensorboard to do the smooth?
Right now I can do an alternative way in python like:
    sav_smoooth = savgol_filter(Y, 51, 3)
    plt.plot(X, Y)
But I didn't get a similar results as shown in tensorboard by doing so. Is there a function I can call?  Could you provide an API that allow this kind of operation?
Thanks.
