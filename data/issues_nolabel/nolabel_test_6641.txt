configure: Handle existing TF_CUDNN_VERSION correctly on OSX.

The configure script sets TF_CUDNN_EXT based on the desired CuDNN version. When TF_CUDNN_VERSION does not exist, the script correctly extracts the version from CuDNN's library symlink and uses it to populate TF_CUDNN_EXT. When TF_CUDNN_VERSION does exist, the script uses it to derive TF_CUDNN_EXT.
Unfortunately, the logic for the latter case does not cover the special case in OSX naming. This commit adds logic to handle the special case in OSX.
