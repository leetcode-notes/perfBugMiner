Steps to reproduce

I compile tf for iOS with the makefile
I frozen a model with last step as  a boolean_mask (that prozen pb file runs perfectly with TF 0.9.0 python api )
I run it in iOS, log report

Running model failed:Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Gather' with these attrs
     [[Node: classes_num_filtered/Gather = Gather[Tindices=DT_INT64, Tparams=DT_INT64, validate_indices=true](classes_num_filtered/Reshape, classes_num_filtered/Squeeze)]]

so it happens with the gather op inside the boolean_mask, when I removed this operation, it runs without problem in iOS.
Is that means gather op is not currently support in iOS?
Do I have a work around for now? I need to filter the data with porbs > threhold.
        mask = self.classes_prob > self.threshold
        self.classes_prob_filtered = tf.boolean_mask(self.classes_prob, mask, name="probs_filtered") 
        self.classes_arg_filtered = tf.boolean_mask(self.classes_arg, mask, name="classes_num_filtered") 
        self.boxes_filtered = tf.boolean_mask(self.boxes, mask, name="boxes_filtered") 
I checked the  tf_cc_files.txt, tensorflow/core/kernels/gather_op.cc do exist.
