Only use weakref.finalize from backports in Python < 3.4

System information

Arch Linux (up-to-date)
TensorFlow installed from binary (with pacman, Arch package manager)
TensorFlow version: 1.2.0
No GPU or CUDA

Describe the problem
tensorflow/python/util/tf_should_use.py is doing from backports import weakref (introduced by    cf238e1), though I guess this is only useful for Python 2. In Python 3, we could simply import weakref. This bug has been observed by other people and reported on the Arch Linux bug tracker.
