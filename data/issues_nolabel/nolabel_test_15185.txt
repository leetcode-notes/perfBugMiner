[XLA] Add fast path cases for common scatter and gather operations

This change checks if the indices vector passed to a scatter or gather operation is a constant, and does a fast-path operation when it is filled with a zero-based incrementing set.
This is quite a common case because of tensor-array stack and unstack.
