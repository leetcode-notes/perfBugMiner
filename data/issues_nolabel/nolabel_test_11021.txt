bazel does not co-operate with Ubuntu's update-alternatives

System information
TF 1.2, Ubuntu 17.04 on GCE, CUDA 8.0, gcc 4.9.4
Describe the problem
bazel fails to compile tensorflow when multiple versions of gcc are present and the default points to /etc/alternatives/gcc. Specifically, it fails to find the C and C++ header files. However, all works well when configure is set to use /usr/bin/gcc.
