MKL: Dockerfile Locked to Broadwell/AVX2 arch to work around Eigen Issues with AVX512

Eigen currently has issues when Tensorflow is compiled with -march=skylake, or the container is build on a skylake system with -march=native. The container is now compiled with -march=broadwell, which adds AVX2 instructions, which are supported on Skylake, Haswell, Broadwell, KNL and KNM architectures.
