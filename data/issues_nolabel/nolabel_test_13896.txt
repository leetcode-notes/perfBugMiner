Build Error - Unable to clone jsoncpp repo, all others seem to be working

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  Source from master branch
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):  cmake 3.9.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.0/cuDNN 7
GPU model and memory:  GTX 1080
Exact command to reproduce:  MSBuild /filelogger /m:4 /p:Configuration=Release tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I have been trying to build the TensorFlow pip package.  For some reason, while I have verified that the build is able to clone the other git repos, the jsoncpp one seems to be killing my build.
