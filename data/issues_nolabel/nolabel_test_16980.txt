Tensorboard Error 404, path /[[_dataImageSrc]] not found

I am using the object detection API
and training a new ssd_mobilenet from scratch with my dataset.
I already did a successful retraining, but now i want to try a complete new training without checkpoint.
The training and evaluation job seem to run normal, but when i start tensorboard and open port 6006 in my browser,  the terminal where its running shows following error:
W0213 11:04:23.869396 Thread-2 application.py:273] path /[[_dataImageSrc]] not found, sending 404
and no scalars, except of the learning rate, are visualized in tensorboard.
In contrast to that Evaluation images, the graph, distributions and histogram are all shown correctly.
