Code documentation for `confusion_matrix.py` misleading

Describe the problem
The documentation for confusion_matrix.py says:
  Args:
    labels: 1-D `Tensor` of real labels for the classification task.
    predictions: 1-D `Tensor` of predictions for a given classification.

, however I found that those two arguments are simply python arrays and not Tensors. The following trial test code demonstrates this. As a TF/Python newbie, I'm wondering if this is actually a real issue, and if so I'll create a PR to correct it to prevent confusion to future programmers.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

y_ = [0, 2, 2, 2]
y = [2, 1, 2, 2]

with tf.Session() as sess:
    confusion_matrix = tf.confusion_matrix(labels=y_, predictions=y, num_classes=4)
    confusion_matrix_to_Print = sess.run(confusion_matrix)
    print(confusion_matrix_to_Print)
