Running own TensorFlow model on Android gives native inference error: “Session was not created with a graph before Run()!”

I was able to run the Inception-v3 model on Android just fine, and I now want to run my own trained TensorFlow model on Android. I'm following the approach from TensorFlow's image recognition tutorial and the Android TensorFlow demo, and adapting as necessary. My changes include: (a) integrating Android OpenCV as part of the bazel build (b) using own model and label file and (c) adjusting parameters (img_size, input_mean, input_std, etc.) accordingly.
From Android logcat, running my model with the tensorflow android demo app gives:
E/native: tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:202 Error during inference: Invalid argument: Session was not created with a graph before Run()!
...
E/native: tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:159 Output [output/Softmax:0] not found, aborting!

Environment info
OS X Yosemite (10.10.5), LGE Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1), Android SDK 23, Android OpenCV SDK 23, Bazel 0.4.0.
Steps taken

Saved own model's checkpoint (.ckpt) and graph definition (.pb) files separately using tf.train.Saver() then tf.train.write_graph()
Froze graph using freeze_graph.py (using bazel), gives 227.5 MB file
Optimized the graph using optimize_for_inference.py (additionally tried strip_unused.py)
Copied frozen, optimized, or stripped graph to android/assets
Doubled the total byte limit using coded_stream.SetTotalBytesLimit() in jni_utils.cc to handle my large model size
Built the tensorflow android app using bazel
Installed on android device using adb and bazel

As a sanity check, I have tested my model in C++ built with bazel following the tutorial here label_image, and my model correctly outputs a prediction. I have also tried playing with the order by which I save my graph def and checkpoint files before freezing, but no change.
Any help would be great.
