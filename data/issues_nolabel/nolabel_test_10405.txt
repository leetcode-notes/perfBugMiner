Operation functions return operations, not Tensors

The way the return value for many TensorFlow operations is described in the documentation is a potential (and actual, from experience) source of confusion.
For example the docs for tf.acos say (like many ops):

"Returns: A Tensor. ..."

But that's not true, is it: Tensors are graph edges (pipes through with values flow), while tf.acos is a graph node (an operation that needs to be executed to put a value into the pipe). Right?
Shouldn't the documentation say that these functions return operations, which, when evaluated, produce a Tensor? (And if not why does the TensorFlow documentation say that these operations return Tensors?)
