Documentation request: leave all function names on the sidebar

Before, I found it really nice that I could ctrl+f to look up a function really quickly. Now I either have to Google it or use the search bar, or worse, scan through the hierarchy and click a few times and scroll til I find it. Not a huge deal, but relatively painful.
It was nice to get instant search results for even partial bits of function names.
