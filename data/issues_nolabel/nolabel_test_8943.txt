Ibverbs-based RDMA path

This patch introduces an ibverbs-based RDMA path between servers for tensor transfer (weights, gradients, etc). The existing gRPC path remains and is responsible for "administrative" tasks, such as setting up the Rdma path, exchanging computation graphs, etc. Design details can be found in the README file below:
