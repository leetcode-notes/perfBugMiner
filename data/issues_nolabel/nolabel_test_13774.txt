Cannot install Tensorflow with specific GCC version

I'm trying to install Tensorflow 1.3 without success
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Gentoo
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Trying from source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 3.4.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 5.1.5
GPU model and memory: GTX 960
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I'm trying to install Tensorflow 1.3 (branch r1.3) from sources on my Gentoo machine.
The problem with the default compiler is that it it's a version 6.3 that is not supported by Tensorflow: I've tried and got an error indicating that GCC later than 5 are not supported.
Therefore, I need to specify a specific GCC version. I'm setting it via $CC/$CXX and in the installation for CUDA:
build --action_env GCC_HOST_COMPILER_PATH="/usr/bin/gcc-5.4.0"
But when I try to run bazel, I got the following error:

gcc-5.4.0: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory

What can I do to install Tensorflow using /usr/bin/gcc-5.4.0 and /usr/bin/g++-5.4.0 rather than /usr/bin/gcc ?
I've seen this f0faf51 that seems releated, but in my case, this is already done. And it seems to be used for clang compilation anyway.
