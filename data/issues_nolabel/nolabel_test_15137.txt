Tensorflow broken by new Bazel versions

Simplest way to reproduce the issue, run:
$ bazel build --config=opt --incompatible_load_argument_is_label --nobuild //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Suggested fix to tensorflow/third_party/sycl/sycl/BUILD.tpl:
-load("platform", "sycl_library_path")
+load(":platform.bzl", "sycl_library_path")

-load("platform", "readlink_command")
+load(":platform.bzl", "readlink_command")

This should address the immediate need.
There are other issues to fix (although not as pressing). You can see them by building using --all_incompatible_changes.
Let me know if you need any help.
Thanks!
