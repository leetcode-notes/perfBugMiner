unterminated substitute pattern in download_dependencies.sh

Environment info
Operating System:
OS X (El capitan)
I'm trying to build a static library with the end goal of using tensorflow for mobile apps. When I run the download_dependencies script I get this terminal log:

To an untrained eye it seems like a potentially easy fix but I have no experience with what would be required to fix it so if anyone has any suggestions/could point me in the right direction that would be dope.
Thanks
