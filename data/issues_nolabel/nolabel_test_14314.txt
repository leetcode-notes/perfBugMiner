eager module has no attributes

My OS is Ubuntu 16.04
Python version is 3.5
Tensorflow version is 14.0
when I tried a simple code for TF Eager module
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.contrib.eager as tfe
tfe.enable_eager_execution()
x = [[2.]]
m = tf.matmul(x, x)
I got a error
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.eager' has no attribute 'enable_eager_execution'
So what's wrong?
