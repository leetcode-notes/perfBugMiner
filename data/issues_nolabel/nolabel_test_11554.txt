Feature request: GPU support for tf.bincount

Hi. In my opinion, tf.bincount is a very useful and simple function to build weighted histograms like in the example below, but recently i learned that unfortunately does not have GPU support. It could be very useful to run it on GPU, since i can't figure any simple way to do a weighted histogram efficiently. Thanks.
sess = tf.Session()

values = tf.random_uniform((1,50),10,20,dtype = tf.int32)
weights = tf.random_uniform((1,50),0,1,dtype = tf.float32)

counts = tf.bincount(values, weights = weights)

histogram = sess.run(counts)
print(histogram)
