Add header only build rules for XLA external plugins

This change includes the exporting of XLA symbols in the main python plugin.
This allows external shared-object plugins to be built against the XLA source header files
and to be loaded into a running process.
Note:  I have only exposed some protobuf symbols.  Exposing protobuf causes tensorboard to fail to load.
