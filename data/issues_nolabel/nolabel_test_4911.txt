Greenish image when using convertYUV420ToARGB8888

I'm experimenting the TensorFlow Android Camera Demo. but it seems that the ImageUtils.convertYUV420ToARGB8888 used to convert images from the camera input to RGB  bytes array is not handling very well the YUV_420_888 format.
Here is the output of ImageUtils.saveBitmap(rgbFrameBitmap);
