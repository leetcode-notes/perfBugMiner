Environment info
Tried both OS X and Linux (Ubuntu 16)
On both utilizing CPU only.
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Any simple operation (i.e. calculating logits with a 3 layer deep network with simple regression in each layer) in which the data was fed with either a parse_example, parse_single_example, building a CustomRunner that feeds a RandomShuffleQueue or utilizing QueueRunner.  In all of those the operation and time to complete 1 epoch took considerably more than if I were to save the data in a bumpy array and feed it during a call to sess.run() with the feed_dict.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Tried to score the web for solutions and ran into a couple blog posts describing the problem but can't seem to find solutions.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
Tried this on both TF 0.10 and the latest RC for 0.11.
