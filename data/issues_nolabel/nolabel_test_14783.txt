Debugging control flow gradients code

Hi,
I've been trying to debug some code I have for computing gradients over control flow ops and I've encountered a couple issues:

@itsmeolivia The shape check introduced in commit bac56b3 breaks the code here when creating a backprop indexed slices accumulator. That's because when concatenating the indices in line 2528, the shape changes.
I have implemented most of the same unit tests and all works well. I also have support for RNNs and things are fine. However, when I implement a decoder that involves a while loop with a cond nested within it, there are cases where I have a problem. More specifically, if I use an existing tensor (created outside the while loop) within a cond branch, I get this error: Retval[0] does not have value. I realize this comes from a switch output of a dead branch being used, but can't figure out exactly what's wrong. Note that this only happens when computing gradients and only when I use an existing tensor within a branch. What would be a good way to debug this?
More generally, how can I debug error like Retval[0] does not have value. No stack trace is provided and I'm not sure how I could configure TensorFlow when compiling to add some debugging information (e.g., stack trace). @asimshankar @skye @alextp Is there some way to setup and run TensorFlow in a debug mode of some sort?

Thanks! :)
