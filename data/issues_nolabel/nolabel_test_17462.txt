Added replicate_model_fn to contrib.estimator.

I noticed that multi-gpu training (in a tower-like fashin) in r1.4 is not supported. So I copied the replicate_model_fn from r1.5 and applied the needed changes:
-adding another key in ops.GraphKeys "METRIC_VARIABLES"
-imported replicate_model_fn in contrib.estimator init.py
