32-bit Windows exe generation using cmake

Hi
I have compiled my code using the procedure outlined in the documentation to generate 64-bit exe on windows using cmake. Now I want to create 32-bit binary but cmake does not run for the option -A x86.
Can somebody how can I generate a 32-bit binary still using 64-bit VS tools?
