HEAD compiles without error, but not completely? build_pip_package fails.

CentOS 6.7
Cuda 7.0
cuDNN 4.0.7
I resolve #2266 by hard coding the python2.7 path in third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.
After also resolving a similar problem with swig, it compiles without errors:
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package
INFO: Elapsed time: 228.884s, Critical Path: 199.55s

But it seems that build_pip_package was only partially (?) completed:
rdipiet2@jhu.edu@login-node03 tensorflow $ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package testonly
Tue May 17 11:09:33 EDT 2016 : === Using tmpdir: /tmp/tmp.akIEI1WBAX

cp: cannot stat `bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/external': No such file or directory

Any ideas? Could something be failing silently?
