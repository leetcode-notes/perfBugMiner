Bazel doesn't use the optimization flag specified in configuration

Hi
I was compiling TensorFlow on a PowerPC machine and it kept failing with the error "unrecognized command line option -march=native" when compiling the file pcre_byte_order.c. This happened even though I specified the default flag -mcpu=native when running ./configure. I also used the --cxxopt=-mcpu=native flag to no avail, and the only way to solve the problem was to remove the --config=opt flag when invoking bazel.
