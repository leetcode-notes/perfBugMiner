skflow: DNNClassifier fit has no logdir Parameter

I'm missing the logdir parameter on DNNClassifier  fit. This is either a bug or a changed behaviour that I don't get (sorry if this should be on stackoverflow, I'm not sure)
TensorFlowDNNClassifier tells me it's depracted and I should use DNNClassifier:

But when I use DNNClassifier the classifier.fit() Method loses it's logdir parameter (I use for tensorboard):

The behaviour slightly changes in general like now max_steps behaves like steps previously did and steps or no parameter about steps trains very long/forever.
