added patch needed for jetson tx2/1

arm64 does not support NUMA, so TryToReadNumaNode in cuda_gpu_executor.cc has to be modified accordingly to avoid a failure at runtime.
Currently everybody using a jetson board needs to apply this patch manually, which is a pain if you forget, because it fails at runtime, and not at build. This means that you compile for a couple of hours only to realize you should've done this first.
