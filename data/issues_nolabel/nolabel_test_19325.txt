Alternative to image_tensor_mapped in Tensoreflow-Lite

Hi there, For my iOS app using Tensorflow the pre-processing was done by using image_tensor_mapped. i.e.

uint32_t *pixels = (uint32_t *) calloc(width * height, sizeof(uint32_t));

uint8_t *bufptr = (uint8_t *)pixels;
for (i = 0; i < height; i++){
   for (j = 0; j < width; j++){
        blue = bufptr[1] / 255.0;
        green = bufptr[2] / 255.0;
        red = bufptr[3] / 255.0;
            
        image_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 0) = blue;
        image_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 1) = green;
        image_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 2) = red;
            
        bufptr += 4;
    }
}

Have I written custom code - No
OS Platform and Distribution - MacOS
TensorFlowLite installed from - Pod
TensorFlowLite version - 0.1.7
What will be the alternative for image_tensor_mapped in Tensorflow-lite(tflite)
