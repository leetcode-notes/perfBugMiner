The output of bazel version

# bazel version     
Build target: bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/BazelServer_deploy.jar
Build time: Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 (0)
Build timestamp: Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 (0)
Build timestamp as int: 0

It's bazel 0.3.1 actually. No idea why the output from version is so useless. I've installed it from the official deb repo.
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
./configure

# Hit ENTER on every question except:
# Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GPU support? (answer: y)
# Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with. (answer: 6.1)

bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

It's actually a bit more complicated, as the first attempt fails to even begin to compile. So I delete the TF repo, clone again, and configure/build again. It begins to compile, keeps chugging along for a few minutes, and then I get the error shown in the title.
More details here (you'll find there a fully automated procedure to completely reproduce the environment and build process):

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Tried to google around, hoping it's a known issue. Could not find anything related.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
This is the end of the build messages:
