'convolutional.py' considered harmful?

The get started page recommends to run convolutional.py as the first tensorflow neural net model:
$ cd tensorflow/models/image/mnist
$ python convolutional.py

However, running it brought my machine down. After bringing it up again, the NVIDIA driver didn't work properly anymore (the boot messages showed nvidia-related errors and nvidia-smi became slow). I fixed it by booting into single-user mode and reinstalling the NVIDIA/CUDA drivers.
My desktop has two GPUs of type GeForce GTX 780 Ti with 3GB memory each.
I assume that convolutional.py uses too much GPU memory. Maybe a gentler script should be used in the getting-started manual.
