AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'deprecated'

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
No CUDA, I use CPU-only.

Pip version: pip 1.5.4
Python version: 2.7.6
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
Tensorflow version: tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64 , CPU-only

Description:
I was testing the tutorial example of LSTM here.
I followed the instructions to download the code and dataset, and run the program using the command. But the code cannot execute and reports the error message:
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 332, in main tf.contrib.deprecated.scalar_summary("Training Loss", m.cost)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'deprecated'
What I've run:
I just ran the following commands:
wget http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/simple-examples.tgz
tar xvf simple-examples.tgz
python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=simple-examples/data/
I download the code from the github repository.
My tensorflow version is the very latest tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.
Why can't I run this example?
Thank you all for your kind help!!!
