Steps to reproduce

Open Android demo in Android Studio (not imported)
Change org/tensorflow/demo folder names to any other package name
Use replace in path to replace org.tensorflow.demo with the new package name
Run bazel mobile-install //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo --start_app
The demo crashes on startup with the message "Unfortunately, TensorFlow Demo has stopped."

What have you tried?

Importing the demo into Android Studio instead of simply opening it. Was unable to build/run, even without changing package name.
Modifying the tensorflow_jni.h file to remove occurrences of ORG_TENSORFLOW, etc. with the changed package name in the same format, e.g. COM_ME.
Looked through other possibly relevant files for references to the old package name, didn't find anything else, though I might've overlooked some.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(no output)
Also, as a general question, if I wanted to create my own Android app using TensorFlow, what sort of configuration would I need to do? I haven't found any explanation of how the demo works.
