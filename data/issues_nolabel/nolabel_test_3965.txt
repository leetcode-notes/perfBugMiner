Conv2d issue with GPU

I have extracted the activations of a neural net at a certain layer with size [1,28,28,128] and I have a corresponding kernel that I want to convolve with these activations. The kernel shape is [3,3,128,256].
I am using:

2 GTX-1080 GPUs
Cuda-8.0 (The problem persists with Cuda-7.5 as well)
Graphics Driver: NVIDIA-367
Python 2.7

When I perform 2D convolution using the CPU I get the correct answer but when I run it through the GPU I get all zeros. Note that, there is no ReLu operator involved here and the output should not be zero (as confirmed by the CPU output). In addition, I do not think this is a numerical precision error.
I have included the codes, activations and the kernel files for reproducing the problem here:

What have you tried?

I have tried Cuda-7.5
CPU works fine, GPU returns all zeros!
