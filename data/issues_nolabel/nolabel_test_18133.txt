Segmentation fault with TF 1.7 built from source with MKL support

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Amazon Linux (Linux version 4.9.85-38.58.amzn1.x86_64)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce:

git clone -b r1.7 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
./configure
bazel build --jobs $(nproc) --config=opt --config=mkl --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --copt="-DEIGEN_USE_VML" //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/tutorials/image/cifar10/
python cifar10_train.py

Result:
[ec2-user@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx cifar10]$ python cifar10_train.py
Filling queue with 20000 CIFAR images before starting to train. This will take a few minutes.
Segmentation fault

Describe the problem
I tried to compile TF 1.7 from source with MKL and AVX512 support on my AWS EC2 C5.18xlarge instance.
This Segmentation fault appeared when running cifar10_train.py. This error appeared with TF1.5 as well and TF 1.6 fixed it, but now it appears again with 1.7.
I have tried to compile TF without AVX512 with following commands and this error didn't appear again:
bazel build --jobs $(nproc) --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --config=mkl --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mavx --copt=-mfma --copt="-DEIGEN_USE_VML" //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

So I'm guessing this issue is related with AVX512.
