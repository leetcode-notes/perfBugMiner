Make ExamplePartialRun hidden

This is follow up of #7667
Since using op package in tf package causes cyclic dependencies,
using wrapper ops in util_test.go  is required. But the interface of
these ops are different to public one.
In order to avoid confusing of API usage, it is better to hide ExamplePartialRun
and add note of reference to op document.
