Tutorials documentation spelling mistake

At url: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html
I've found that In following paragraph '299 pixel high' is written, which I think should be '299 pixel hight'
The whole paragraph is following in 'Usage with the C++ API' section:
"This gives us a vector of Tensor objects, which in this case we know will only be a single object long. You can think of a Tensor as a multi-dimensional array in this context, and it holds a 299 pixel high, 299 pixel width, 3 channel image as float values. If you have your own image-processing framework in your product already, you should be able to use that instead, as long as you apply the same transformations before you feed images into the main graph."
