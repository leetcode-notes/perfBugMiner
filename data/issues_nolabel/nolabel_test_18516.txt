How to become a voluntary translator of tensorflow's official website in Chinaï¼Ÿ

I am a postgraduate student in computer science from China and have a special passion for deep learning. Due to its high degree of flexibility and powerful computing ability, tensorflow is my most commonly used deep learning framework. I have used it to do a lot of interesting things during my graduate studies. In China, tensorflow is one of the most commonly used deep learning frameworks for developers. However, due to some reasons, tensorflow cannot be normally accessed in China, which restricts the development of tensorflow to some extent, and at the same time it widens the distance between ordinary developers and deep learning. Recently, tensorflow China's official website (tensorflow.google.cn) went online, which is a very good news for Chinese developers. Developers no longer need to use some extra ways to learn to use tensorflow.For most experienced developers in China, reading English documents is not a hindrance. However, for beginners, whether they are new to programming or planning to get started with deep learning, due to the limitation of English reading ability, they are somewhat excluded from official documents, especially English official documents.Many people can only obtain the knowledge of debris through the Baidu search enginer and cannot have a systematic understanding of tensorflow.Due to the special love for google and the worship for tensorflow's open source spirit, I wish to be a tensorflow Chinese volunteer translator.I hope that my efforts will enable Chinese developers to use tensorflow more easily and efficiently. I also hope to have the privilege of expanding tensorflow's influence in China.For the tensorflow official documentation (tensorflow.org), I basically read all the documents and I feel competent to perform this honorable duty.The only question now is how to become a voluntary translator of tensorflow's official website in China. Thanks for your reading and hope to get a reply.
