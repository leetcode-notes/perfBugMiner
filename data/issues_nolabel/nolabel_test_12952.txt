Add support of `axis` for `tf.unique`

This fix tries to address the request from #11575 where axis was not supported for tf.unique.
This fix adds support of axis for tf.unique. In this fix, the additional input axis has been specified as an 1D vector so that it is possible to optionally provide an axis or not. In case axis=[] is provided, no axis is used. In case axis=[x] is used, axis for tf.unique is x. (ref  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42754965/marking-input-as-optional-in-tensorflow)
This fix fixes #11575
