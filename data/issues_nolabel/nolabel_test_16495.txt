Update docs for installing CUDA/CUDNN

This fix addresses the issue raised in #16479 where CUDA/CUDNN versions from the docs do not match TensorFlow v1.5.0.
From the Dockerfile and from the env of docker images, the version of CUDA/CUDNN for TensorFlow v1.5.0:
CUDA_VERSION 9.0.176
CUDNN_VERSION 7.0.5.15

This fix updates the doc so that CUDA version is changed from 8.0 -> 9.0, CUDNN version is changed from 6.0 -> 7.0.
This fix fixes #16479.
