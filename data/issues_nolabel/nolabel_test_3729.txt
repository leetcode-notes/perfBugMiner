[started] convert to records example in tutorial?

As far as i know, the started document only provide a example with mnist example, however, really confused about how tensorflow handle an sparse example.
when it comes to linear model, the libsvm format always be a popular format in research and industry. But how to convert libsvm format entries to tensorflow records? How will an entry represent in tensorflow? in column ways or in row ways?
e.g.
label, key:value, key:value, ....


whereas the key is index, value is the feature value in sparse format.
Can anyone kindly to add such an example to tutorial ? Thanks
