No equivalent to theano.tensor.slinalg.Eigvalsh

Good morning,
I have been trying to reproduce DeepLDA loss function implementation in Tensorflow
(https://github.com/VahidooX/DeepLDA/blob/master/code/objectives.py theano version).
In order to solve a gep, in theano we use T.slinalg.eigvalsh to compute eigenvalues
evals_t = T.slinalg.eigvalsh(Sb_t, St_t)
Tensorflow doesn't provide something similar and approximation are very unstable.
I tried both to solve the gep Aei = Bviei
cho = tf.cholesky(B_t + tf.eye(dim) * r )
inv_cho = tf.matrix_inverse(cho)
evals_t = tf.linalg.eigvalsh(inv_cho * A * tf.transpose(inv_cho))
evals_t =tf.linalg.eigvalsh(tf.matrix_inverse(B) * A )
If you have a solution, please tell me :)
