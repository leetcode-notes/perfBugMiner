Feature Request : Latent Dirichlet Allocation impementation using tensorflow(skflow)

I am trying to Topic Modelling (LDA) using tensorflow. But I could find any existing LDA implementation in TF learn (skflow) package.
Is there any other way to implement Topic Modelling using tensorflow?
It would be helpful if LDA support is given in TF Learn (skflow) similar to the scikit-learn Latent Dirichlet Implementation.
