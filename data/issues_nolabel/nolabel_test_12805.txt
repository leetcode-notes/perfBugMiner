"High-Performance Models" documentation page unclear on StagingArea not being a FIFOQueue

I feel that it would be good to modify the High-Performance Models page to make it clear that the StagingArea class does not guarantee ordered delivery.
This would mean changing the line:

... StagingArea is a queue-like operator similar to tf.FIFOQueue. The difference is that StagingArea offers simpler functionality and can be executed on both CPU and GPU in parallel with other stages.

to something like this:

... StagingArea is a queue-like operator similar to tf.FIFOQueue. The difference is that StagingArea does not guarantee FIFO ordering, but offers simpler functionality and can be executed on both CPU and GPU in parallel with other stages.

I just spent longer than I'd care to admit bug-hunting, when FIFO ordering was critical.
