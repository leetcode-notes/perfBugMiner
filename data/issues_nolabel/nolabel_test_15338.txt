Tensorflow AOT examples fail to compile

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 'v1.3.0-rc1-5779-g441571a', '1.4.0'
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.8.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): GCC 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0, CUDNN 6.0.21
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1080, 8GB
Exact command to reproduce: cd tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests ; bazel clean ; bazel build all_tests &>gcc5.log

Describe the problem
I am trying to compile AOT examples, but the compilation fails. I tried to use two different compiler versions (GCC 5.4 and GCC 4.8), but I get errors with both versions. I also tried adding --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" option when using bazel with GCC 5.4, but it doesn't help.
So the exact commands commands were:
bazel build all_tests &>gcc5.log
bazel build --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" all_tests &>gcc5_abi0.log
bazel build all_tests  # Using GCC 4.8, I copied the output manually to gcc_4.8.txt
Tensorflow source code itself was build without any problems both with GCC 5.4 and GCC 4.8. I have built the two versions in separate python virtual environments and afterwards tried to compile aot tests with the corresponding GCC version. I used --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" option when building tensorflow source with GCC 5.4.
