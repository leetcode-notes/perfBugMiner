Change repository command to valid value

When running the example command I got an error from docker saying: docker: invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase.
It seems that the repository name is written with capital letters. This confused me and might confuse others. By replacing TensorFlowImage with a valid repository the first command can also be run.
