Tensorflow installation issue

Hi Team,
I have anaconda with python 2.7 in my windows 7 machine, i tried to install tensorflow with the below command.

c:> conda create -n tensorflow python=2.7
it has installed successfully.
activate tensorflow
it changed the prompt to
(tensorflow) C:>
I have visual studio 2015, and selected the environment as python 2.7 and ran a sample program, it is giving the below error, please suggest.
