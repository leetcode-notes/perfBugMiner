How np.array([]) works in numpy

my sample code :
a = 2.0
b = 3.0
x = np.array([a, b])
print x

Output : [ 2. 3.]
I just wanted to know , how this array is created here.  Basically how np.array works ?  Which constructor/function is invoking to generate this array ?
I tried putting prints in /numpy/numpy/lib/user_array.py but that didn't help.
