Add support for recursive neural networks

I'd like to implement a recursive neural network as in [Socher et al. 2011] in TensorFlow.
Note that this is different from recurrent neural networks, which are nicely supported by TensorFlow. The difference is that the network is not replicated into a linear sequence of operations, but into a tree structure.
Maybe a tree traversal can already be implemented using While ops, but I'm not sure how.
(A bottom-up traversal of a tree would have to be performed for each entry in the dataset, applying the network at each node)
Instinctively, I have the impression that this would need a new C++ op that generalizes While.
