provide project ide setting support

I'm trying to debug the c++ source code to figure out the function call relation.But I find it's very difficult to import the code to any existing ide on Mac.I had to use the bazel command  to build and test. using gdb to debug is a bit frustrating.If there are some useful tool chains, would you please give some tips which will make it easily for developers to try such great tensorflow?Thanks so much.
