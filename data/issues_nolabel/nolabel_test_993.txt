How to run nvidia-docker with TensorFlow GPU docker

Thanks for looking at my issue, really appreciate it.
What I've Done
I have setup an equivalent of a Nvidia DIGITS machine (running Ubuntu 14.04 server), and am attempting to run everything in docker containers.

I have docker installed, and have run nvidia-docker run nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi described here, and I see my 4 TitanX graphic cards.
I have also run the nvidia-docker-plugin described here as sudo -u nvidia-docker nvidia-docker-plugin -s /var/lib/nvidia-docker and I get the output:

nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:02 Loading NVIDIA management library
nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:04 Loading NVIDIA unified memory
nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:04 Discovering GPU devices
nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:05 Provisioning volumes at /var/lib/nvidia-docker/volumes
nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:05 Serving plugin API at /var/lib/nvidia-docker
nvidia-docker-plugin | 2016/02/04 12:54:05 Serving remote API at localhost:3476

which signifies to me that it's working.

I ran the tests here and they all passed.

My Problem

When I try to run the TensorFlow GPU docker image using nvidia-docker

I first run sudo -u nvidia-docker nvidia-docker-plugin -s /var/lib/nvidia-docker in a tmux session.
Then I run nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow-devel-gpu it downloads everything and runs the docker container. Next I run ipython and try to import tensorflow but I get the following errors:
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf

**I think I just have a lack in understanding about how I should run the TensorFlow container, or maybe I have to build the container using nvidia-docker.
Any ideas about how to do this, or general advice about what I'm doing wrong would be amazing. **
Thanks so much.
