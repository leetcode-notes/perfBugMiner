Running tensorflow-gpu in virtual env in remote Ubuntu system

I was attempting to install tensorflow gpu version for my gpu system.

I don't have sudo access in the computer.
Cuda version 7.5 (V7.5.17) is installed
After following all the steps and finding a suitable version of tensorflow suitable to cuda 7.5 I have installed everything. But after installing when I am trying to import tensorflow, these errors are coming.


I don't know how to resolve it. Also, does this error affect the running of my code in gpu or can I ignore it and start coding?
The solutions I found on forum is related to reinstalling cuda but I cannot do that as I don't have sudo access. Can anyone please provide me some other solution to resolve this issue?
I really want to setup my environment soon for the project.
Thank you!
