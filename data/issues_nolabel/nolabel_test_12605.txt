Impossible to change variable inside checkpoint

I have a checkpoint file and I want to change (increase) shapes of some Variables from this checkpoint.
It seems to be impossible using tf.assign
Tried to use tf.assign():
`for var in tf.global_variables():
     if var.name == "22-convolutional/biases:0":
         assign = tf.assign(var, a, validate_shape=False)
         sess.run(assign)`

And then, when I am trying to execute
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
I have an error
Assign requires shapes of both tensors to match. lhs shape= [1,1,1024,60] rhs shape= [1,1,1024,55] [[Node: 22-convolutional/kernel/Adam_1/Assign = Assign[T=DT_FLOAT, _class=["loc:@22-convolutional/kernel"], use_locking=true, validate_shape=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](22-convolutional/kernel/Adam_1, zeros_51)]]
So, is it really impossible in TF? Could it be a feature request?
