Fixed error with NaN an None elements in Wide & Deep Learning Tutorial

There was an error after reading the dataset, looks like the last line (of the dataset) contains NaN values, giving an error when converting to integer (to generate the labels):

Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable

This was fixed droping every line that contains NaN elements:

remove NaN elements
df_train = df_train.dropna(how='any', axis=0)
df_test = df_test.dropna(how='any', axis=0)
