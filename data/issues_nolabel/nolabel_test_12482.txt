Failure to build on OS/X

I have the following error when building on OS/X:
./tensorflow/core/platform/default/mutex.h:25:10: fatal error: 'nsync_cv.h' file not found
#include "nsync_cv.h"
         ^
1 error generated.

Earlier on I get the following warning:
WARNING: /Users/davidn/workspace/tensorflowview/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1632:1: in includes attribute of cc_library rule //tensorflow/core:framework_headers_lib: '../../external/nsync/public' resolves to 'external/nsync/public' not below the relative path of its package 'tensorflow/core'. This will be an error in the future. Since this rule was created by the macro 'cc_header_only_library', the error might have been caused by the macro implementation in /Users/davidn/workspace/tensorflowview/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1632:1.
