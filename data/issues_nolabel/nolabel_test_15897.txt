Tensor Core support for NVIDIA Volta architecture

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
5386775
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.8.1
GCC/Compiler version (if comp6iling from source):5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:9.1 / 7.0.5
GPU model and memory: Titan V
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
It is widely reported that using float16 on Nvidia Volta architecture comes only with x2 improvement instead of the expected x4 x8 improvement using Tensor Cores
tensorflow/benchmarks#77

I checked that Tensorflow master branch used
cudnnGetConvolutionForwardAlgorithm
to get the best possible algorithm for the given GPU.
However I think either
cudnnGetConvolutionForwardAlgorithm_v7
or
cudnnFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithmEx
should be used to fully utilize the Volta architecture.
Could you please check this issue with a Volta architecture GPU?
