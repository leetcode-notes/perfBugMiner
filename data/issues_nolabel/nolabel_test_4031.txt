SupervisedSession cannot run dict fetchs.

Installed from source, 0.10.0rc0.
supervised_session.SupervisedSession  under  contrib.learn cannot run dict fetchs:
1.Document says that it's same as tf.Session.run() and confused.
    def run(self, fetches, feed_dict=None, options=None, run_metadata=None):
    """Run ops in the supervised session.
        This method is completely compatible with the `tf.Session.run()` method.

        Args:
        fetches: Same as `tf.Session.run()`.
        feed_dict: Same as `tf.Session.run()`.
        options: Same as `tf.Session.run()`.
        run_metadata: Same as `tf.Session.run()`.

        Returns:
        Same as `tf.Session.run()`.
        """
        return self._sess.run(fetches, feed_dict=feed_dict, options=options,
                          run_metadata=run_metadata)

2.it is constructed with MonitoredSession, so it can only run one or a list.
    actual_fetches = {
        caller': fetches,
        self._global_step_tensor: self._global_step_tensor,
        'monitors': [_as_graph_element(f, self.graph) for f in monitor_fetches]
    }

Could you support for running a dict as tf.Session.run()? Or modify the document more clearly?
