TensorflowLite - Android

I am using TensorflowLite for Android. I tried setting up the java demo project as described in Tensorflow site (Android demo app) and succeeded.
I am getting an error while running the app in Android studio.  ERROR (Error:(152, 15) error: cannot find symbol method setNumThreads(int))
In file  ImageClassifier.java
**public void setNumThreads(int num_threads) {
if (tflite != null)
tflite.setNumThreads(num_threads);
}**
I understand that the method setNumThreads is not found in the Interpreter.  needed help to resolve this issue..
