Tensorflow on imx6

Hi,
I am trying to port tensorflow on imx6 board,
First i installed bazel and tensorflow from source it got installed but when i did import tensorflow i was getting this:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py", line 41, in 
from tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow_internal import *
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py", line 28, in 
_pywrap_tensorflow_internal = swig_import_helper()
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py", line 24, in swig_import_helper
_mod = imp.load_module('_pywrap_tensorflow_internal', fp, pathname, description)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/imp.py", line 242, in load_module
return load_dynamic(name, filename, file)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/imp.py", line 342, in load_dynamic
return _load(spec)
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so
Then in tried to install using tensorflow makefile it also got installed but when i ran my own .pb file it gave this error:
[[Node: MultipleGridAnchorGenerator/assert_equal/Equal = Equal[T=DT_INT32](MultipleGridAnchorGenerator/assert_equal/x, MultipleGridAnchorGenerator/strided_slice_2)]]
