Cannot interpret feed_dict key as tensor: tensor tensor(import/input:0, shape=(1, 299, 299, 3), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.

I'm running label_image.py code given at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image.py for inference on an image using InceptionV3 model trained on my own dataset. But it's giving the following error

Cannot interpret feed_dict key as tensor: tensor tensor(import/input:0, shape=(1, 299, 299, 3), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.

Could anyone please help me with this issue ? Thanks in advance.
