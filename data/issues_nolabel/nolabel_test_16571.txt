Support ./configure [--help|-h] to show possible config options

This is to fix 16518, which would start the interactive prompt immediately even when issue "./configure [--help|-h]".
The fix is to show the possible bazel config options when the help/ h commands issued.
Feel free to comment if any we needs to further improve.
