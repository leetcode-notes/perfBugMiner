Error while installing Tensorflow on Mac via terminal

I am trying to install Tensorflow on my mac via the terminal using the tutorial and commands that are provided by the official website linked below.
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation
However when running the pip install tensorflow & the pip install tensorflow-gpu command i get the same error (picture is attached).


I am not sure why this error is occurring. Any help that can be provided would be appreciated.
