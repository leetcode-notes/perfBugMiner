tensorflow/models/compression does not work

To run the compression model:
python encoder.py --input_image=/your/image/here.png \ --output_codes=output_codes.pkl --iteration=15 --model=residual_gru.pb
However, this error shows up:

[libprotobuf ERROR google/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:207] A protocol message was rejected because it was too big (more than 67108864 bytes).  To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h.

I see from v0.8.0 RC0 that it has been fixed:

Added instructions and binaries for ProtoBuf library with fast serialization and without 64MB limit

Could this error have been reintroduced? I'm using 0.10.0.
