AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'rnn'

I had a version of ptb_word_lm.py which worked in 0.11. Now I am trying to use the same code in version 1.0.1. I am facing the following error:
outputs, state = tf.nn.rnn(cell, inputs,initial_state=self._initial_state)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'rnn'
Please help soon !!
