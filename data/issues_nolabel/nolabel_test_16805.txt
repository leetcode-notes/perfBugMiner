Feature Request: max_norm argument added to tf.nn.nce_loss

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes

Describe the problem
I would like to request an additional argument to added to the tf.nn.nce_loss function. This function calls the tf.nn.embedding_lookup in order to build the matrix of negative sample embeddings. tf.nn.embedding_lookup has a max_norm argument, and I would like for the value of the max_norm argument supplied to tf.nn.nce_loss to be propagated to the tf.nn.embedding_lookup call.
