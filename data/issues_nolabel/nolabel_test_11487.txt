'return_state' in keras rnn layers

Im using tensorflow r1.2.
In the original Keras, There's an option to get the last hidden state of a rnn layer. (
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L99 )
And it disappeared in tensorflow version of the keras.
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L89)
Is there any reason for this?? I think the 'return_state' option is quite useful.
