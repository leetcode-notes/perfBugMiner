Enable a mechanism for filtering out log messages using

an environment variable.  Reads the environment variable
on the first call to LOG, uses it to filter out based on the
severity of the log message.
By default, min log level is 0, mapping to INFO.
If you set the env var to 1, INFO is filtered out b t
WARNING still gets printed.
Parsing code is rudimentary, to avoid bringing in
dependencies into platform (e.g., strings/lib/numbers.h,
env_var.h, etc).  For this use-case it is probably fine.
Fixes #1258.
