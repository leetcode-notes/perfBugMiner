Feature request: ability to pass training_hooks and others through keras.estimator.model_to_estimator

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): I'm trying to
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): n/a
Python version: n/a
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce: n/a

Describe the problem
When I go to create an Estimator from a Keras model, I'm unable to pass training hooks, evaluation hooks, and other fun things (like scaffolds) since the _create_keras_model_fn call doesn't take any of that stuff in.
Could it simply just take these as arbitrary **kwargs and pass them through to the EstimatorSpec initializer?

Thanks!
