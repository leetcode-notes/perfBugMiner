tf.contrib.distributions.Logistic   log_cdf method has wrong sign

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes?
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Sierra 10.12.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary, via pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0 (v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
logistic = tf.contrib.distributions.Logistic(loc = 0., scale = 1.) 
logistic.log_cdf(0.).eval(session = tf.Session())
Describe the problem
tf.contrib.distributions.Logistic's log_cdf() method has the wrong sign. The above code returns 0.69314718, but it should be -0.69314718 (i.e. log(0.5).
Appears to be the same for all parameters and values.
The cdf() method is fine.
I've not seen this problem with log_cdf() in any of the other distributions, so it looks like an isolated bug.
