XLA reports error with 1000 steps of static_bidirectional_rnn

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.1 or 1.3
Python version: 2.7.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.8.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 5.1
GPU model and memory: M40
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
This issue can only be reproduced when XLA works with static_bidirectional_rnn with 1000 steps, and the "seq_len" of static_bidirectional_rnn must be assigned, which means it works with "dynamic calculation". When the issue is reproduced, it reports:
2017-11-01 18:47:16.497266: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:731] failed to load PTX text as a module: CUDA_ERROR_NO_BINARY_FOR_GPU
2017-11-01 18:47:16.497294: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:736] error log buffer (163 bytes): ptxas application ptx input, line 7231; error   : Kernel '_fusion_1' exceeds parameter space limit of 4352 bytes
ptxas fatal   : Ptx assembly aborted due to error


From my analysis, a fused XLA instruction requires for more than 1000 input parameters. This further leads to a PTX kernel with 1000+ parameters, which is not accepted by the cuda driver.
This is what I found from the PTX ISA documents:
The maximum memory size supported by PTX for normal (non-opaque type) parameters is 4352 bytes. Prior to PTX ISA version 1.5, the maximum size was 256 bytes.
