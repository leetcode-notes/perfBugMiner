Cannot build toco or use it to convert pretrained model

Hi, i encountered a lot of problems using tflite. I can build the demo and run it on my android phone. I am trying to convert my trained model to tflite format and cannot even build toco. I have already editted the workspace with the directory of sdk and ndk. The first problem shows up saying max/min is no -std member. I add the #include<algorithm> to that file and the next strange problem shows up. Is this tool(tensorflow lite) is going to be obsoleted?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): win 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6.0
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):7.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/7
GPU model and memory: 1060/6G
Exact command to reproduce: bazel run --config=opt //tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco:toco -- --input_file=/tmp/mobilenet_v1_0.50_128/frozen_graph.pb --output_file=/tmp/foo.tflite  --inference_type=FLOAT --input_shape=1,128,128,3 --input_array=input --output_array=MobilenetV1/Predictions/Reshape_1 --verbose_failures

Describe the problem
The command above is verifying my setup through official site examples, and it even cannot work. The error msg is below.
