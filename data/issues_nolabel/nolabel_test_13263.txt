`params` is Not Used for Canned Estimators Implementations

The canned estimators implementations do not seem to pass the params to their parent class Estimator. For example, DNNClassifier puts all the parameters, e.g. hidden_units, optimizer, etc. inside the model_fn and then pass the model_fn to the parent class here. This makes it difficult for reporting or parameter tuning purposes.
I saw params is an exposed property for Estimator, however, it's mostly empty for canned estimators since it's not used. Is this on purpose?
Thanks!
