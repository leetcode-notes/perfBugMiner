Feature request: tf.info to show docstrings in jupyter notebook

When working with jupyter notebooks, it is really helpful to see the documentation within the notebook. Numpy has a function called np.info which takes a numpy function as argument and prints its docstring. For example, np.info(np.mean) prints the docstring for np.mean. It would be really helpful to have an equivalent tf.info for those of us who work with jupyter notebooks (and who doesn't?).
