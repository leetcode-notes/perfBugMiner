558: Markdown to html, titles

Hi,
Most of projects I have worked on were based on Jekyll, pigments of markdown to webpages and used title/layout based on .yml/css/layouts file.In other python projects, providing title on the link itself works.Both variants done as example on Contributing.md to seek inputs.thanks.

title: Contributing to Spark

just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ "How To Contribute Using Github‚Äù)

However as this largely depends on project .js/.css files, from my quick look on this codebase, seems the tensorflow/python/framework/docs.py the .md content just gets transformed to body content, and likely library.title reflects the title of page.thanks.
