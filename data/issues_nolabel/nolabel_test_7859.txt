Error using TF in Python

I have Python 3.5.2 and Anaconda 4.1.1 (64bit) and when i tried installing TF i got the same error earlier today.
After following uninstall and then reinstall TF commands i was able to start Python app using TF; but now i am getting OpKernel error for unknown op: UpdateFertileSlots.

Any idea how to fix this?
N.B: i did searched online and could not find any answer in SO or any other resource to fix this issue to start using TF.
