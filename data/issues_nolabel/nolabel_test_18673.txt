gradient_override_map for tf.distributions.Bernoulli

I want to override gradient calculation for a series of ops that computes
v = tf.reduce_mean(tf.distributions.Bernoulli(prob=[x]*10).sample())
Here, shape of v is same as shape of x and I want dv/dx = input gradient at v
Now I know one can register gradients for a single op but how about a series of ops. If I try to register gradient for individual ops in the series I get error with shapes of input and gradient at one of the ops in the series.
Update 1:
I have written custom code for this purpose
OS Platform and Distribution I am using is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
TensorFlow installed from - pip
TensorFlow version - 1.5.0
Bazel version - NA
CUDA/cuDNN version - CuDNN9
GPU model and memory - GForce GTX 1060TI
Exact command to reproduce - NA
Is this possible in tensorflow?
Thanks in advance!!
