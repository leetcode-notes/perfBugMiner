Fix PATH error with non-system GCC (#7543).

I have been getting errors from gcc not finding as, due to my user-set PATH not being respected. See issue #7543.
For example, the following setting on Ubuntu 17.04 failed:
export PATH=$HOME/compilers/gcc540/install/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/compilers/gcc540/install/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure
    [...]
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

A fix seems to be rather simple. By just adding :$PATH to the respective command, TensorFlow now builds correctly. See diff.
However, I did not try to understand the full Python script, so I can't judge potential side effects.
