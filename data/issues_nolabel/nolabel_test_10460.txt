tf.import_graph_def() does not return list of tensors or operations

I read the documentation for tf.import_graph_def here.
As the documentation says:
Returns: A list of Operation and/or Tensor objects from the imported graph, corresponding to the names in return_elements.
I tried that with this sample code but the method returns None for me.
I had to run some tests using this feature. But stuck at this issue.
Sample code:
import tensorflow as tf
g = tf.Graph()
with g.as_default():
    c = tf.constant(30.0)
    b = tf.constant(20.0)
    a = tf.add(b, c)
gdef = g.as_graph_def()
print(tf.import_graph_def(gdef))```
