Estimator API and transfer learning/fine-tuning

I've been using the Estimator API with the model_fn and input_fn as shown in the official examples (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/resnet/cifar10_main.py for instance).
This all looks great and wonderful. However, I'm now facing an issue for going further with it. I'd like to use a model trained on a dataset and transfer it to another dataset. In practice, I would like to take the weights from the trained model up to the softmax layer and only initialize randomly this final layer. Then, I can do fine-tuning on the new dataset, which has different labels for instance.
I haven't found a way to do what I want. Is it something missing in the interface? Can we have something  like a variable list to restore from a checkpoint and some other not? Ideally, it would be also good to specify variables to be frozen. Does that all make sense?
