Fix error handling for when swig isn't found.

Currently, if swig is not found, then the configure script fails but
does not print an error because we are redirecting the stderr of type -p swig
to /dev/null, which results in this command failing the configure script
immediately and silently before the subsequent error handling code can be
executed.
This script adds a || true clause so that if swig isn't found, we will
use the error handling code below to print an error message.
Fixes #4928
