ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I installed Cuda 7.5 and cudnn v4. after making the symlinks for cudnn and changing the path variables, when I import tensorflow I get the error : ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. ?
Any advice on how to proceed?
