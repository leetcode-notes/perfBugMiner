[XLA] Replace GCC vector extension with portable Intel SIMD

MSVC does not support GCC vector extension, so replace it with Intel SIMD library. Eigen also uses Intel SIMD library to implement vector functions.
MSVC does not have __SSE4_1__ macro, although it does define __AVX__ when building with /arch:AVX. Since Eigen enables SSE4.1 when __AVX__ is defined (Eigen/Core), we just follow Eigen.
