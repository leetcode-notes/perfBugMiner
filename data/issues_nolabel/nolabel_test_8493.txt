Implementation of LSTMCell inconsistent with the refered paper.

This is an extended issue of the existing issue #8469 .
In the comments, it said that the LSTMCell is implemented based on this paper.
In this paper, the several gates are computed like sum_i(args[i] * W[i]). Here, the args are list of input and m_state. More details can be found in the mentioned paper.
However, in the code the gates are computed as:
      # i = input_gate, j = new_input, f = forget_gate, o = output_gate
      lstm_matrix = _linear([inputs, m_prev], 4 * self._num_units, bias=True)
      i, j, f, o = array_ops.split(
          value=lstm_matrix, num_or_size_splits=4, axis=1)

Diving into the _linear function, showing that:
      res = math_ops.matmul(array_ops.concat(args, 1), weights)

The argsare firstly concatenated, and then matmulwith the weights. In this implementation, the parameter number of the weights is much larger than what said in the paper. This is totally different from what said in the paper.
