Feature request: tf.pad to pad an image with different values correspond to different channels respectively

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1
Python version: 2.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080, 8G

Describe the problem
tf.pad has a parameter constant_values to control the padding values. However, the value need to be a single scalar and it is used to pad all the channels equally.
Then if we want to pad the imagenet mean values [123.68, 116.779, 103.939] to 3 channels of a RGB image tensor respectively, we cannot achieve it by tf.pad.
So is it possible to extend tf.pad to be able to pad 3 channels with different values respectively?
