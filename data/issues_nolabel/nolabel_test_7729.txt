How to delete existed tensorflow variable?

Hello, I am using windows GPU tensorflow 1.0.
I use ipython notebook to build training model because I can reuse script easily. Sometimes I just want to modify one tensorflow variable, such as W1(shape=[3,3],name="W1") from a existed model. So I just modify the variable and run the model building script again. However, tensorflow add W1(shape=[5,5],name="W1_1")  variable to replace old variable W1. It makes some bugs when I continue the next work with W1. Could you tell me how to delete old variable "W1" and add new different variable named "W1"?
