Workaround 'too perfect forwarding' issue in variant_op_registry

In variant_op_registry.h
std::unordered_map<std::tuple<VariantXOp, StringPiece, StringPiece>, 
                     VariantXOpFn, TupleHash>

seems to be falling victim to 'too perfect forwarding' issue ( SO link, Andrzej's blog) with gcc-6.4, gcc-7.2 and clang-4 in ubuntu-17.10 (and possibly others). This PR works around the issue by replacing std::tuple with a simple struct.
