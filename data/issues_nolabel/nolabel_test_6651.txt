change tensorboard html data request path to relative

Tensorboard use a  absolute path  for data request like /data/runs, /data/graph, /data/logdir.
If someone want to deploy tensorboard with a path http://host/tensorboard/, the data xmlhttprequest would be  http://host/data/runs,  thus give not found 404 errors and tensorboard doesn't work properly.
To make the data request with http://host/tensorboard/data/runs, a relative  xmlhttprequest url for data request should be used.  The default dataDir = '/data'; will change to dataDir = 'data';
The default  dataDir to dataDir = 'data' will always work whenever tf-tensorboard.html is placed or any context path is set.
