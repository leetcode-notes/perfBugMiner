ptb_rnn_lm.py error: InvalidArgumentError: logits and labels must have the same first dimension, got logits shape [400,10000] and labels shape [420]

I am having the same issue that can be found here:
#6469
That issue was closed however. It seems like a bunch of people are still having the problem with the LSTM Penn Tree Bank dataset tutorial online here
Has anyone found a fix? The exact error I am getting is:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): logits and labels must have the same first dimension, got logits shape [400,10000] and labels shape [420]
	 [[Node: Train/Model/sequence_loss_by_example/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits = SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits[T=DT_FLOAT, Tlabels=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](Train/Model/add, Train/Model/sequence_loss_by_example/Reshape)]]

I have made all of the changes to incorporate the model being a newer version. I have TensorFlow 12.1. Can anyone help?! Thank you all so much.
