Disable display “successfully opened CUDA library ****” when import tensorflow

Hello,
when import tensorflow it will output some info which is boring to me , how to disable this dispaly without compile again? set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES seems no work.
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf;
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so.7.5 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.5.1 locally
