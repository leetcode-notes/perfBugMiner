Support S3 Filesystem for Tensorflow

This is for S3 Filesystem support in Tensorflow.
It utilizes Tensorflow's FileSystem C++ interface, similar to currently available HDFS or GCS support. The code depends on AWS's C++ SDK (Apache License) https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp
The code is placed under the directory of tensorflow/contrib/s3
TODO List:

 Add the implementation of S3 file system
 Work out the BUILD configuration (currently build a .so, not sure the best way in bazel)
 Add tests similar to gcs_file_system_test.cc

This fix is related to #10616
