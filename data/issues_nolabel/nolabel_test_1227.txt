bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo missing dependency declarations

For bugs/issues, please fill in the following.  The more information you
provide, the more likely we can help you.
Environment info
Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10.5)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:  3b8f0df
Steps to reproduce

Build TensorFlow from source following these instructions for building with CUDA support on Mac
Tested TensorFlow installed correctly
Attempted to build Android demo following these instructions

What have you tried?

Tried adding the missing dependencies into this BUILD file between lines 14 and 15.  Added lines that looked like:
"tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h", "tensorflow/core/platform/macros.h",

My thought was that maybe adding the asked for dependencies might do the trick.
My thought when that didn't work was maybe I need to use the "deps" option instead of the "srcs" option, but since I have NO familiarity with Bazel that seems problematic. :-/
