Commit to enable true fully convolutional application of network

Hello,
I have created a pull request to tensorflow/models long time ago
and just want to point out that it will make using TF-Slim easier for
Image Segmentation:
tensorflow/models#684
Is there a chance someone can review it?
Thank you.
