Feature request: Want TFSlim to automatically download the pre-trained checkpoint

I want TFSlim to automatically download the pre-trained checkpoint like Keras:
https://keras.io/applications/
When I use Keras, the code below automatically download the pre-trained VGG 16 weights:
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input
import numpy as np

model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
On the other hands, TFSlim required to download the checkpoint manually.
Is there any plans to add the feature?
