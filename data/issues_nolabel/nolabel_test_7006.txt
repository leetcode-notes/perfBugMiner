can not plot embedded data points using tensorboard embedding chart

I tried to plot original input data points and embedded data points using tensorboard embedding function.
I did basically everything according to the official instruction.
There are three tensors in my graph, namely input, embedding, and embedded.
and embedded = tf.MatMul(input, embedding)
I failed to plot the embedded tensor, even thought I provide metadata file , tensorboard seems just ignore it.
However I did plot the input tensor, tensorboard has no problem locating metadata file, it shows all the points in 3D with labels I provided in the metadata file.
I also succeeded to plot the embedding tensor, So does anyone know how to solve this?
