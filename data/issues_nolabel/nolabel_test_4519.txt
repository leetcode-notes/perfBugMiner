raw_rnn

For @ebrevdo on his new raw_rnn implementation.
In your example
When you define next_input as the following:
elements_finished = (time >= sequence_length)
...
next_input = tf.cond(
    finished,
    lambda: tf.zeros([batch_size, input_depth], dtype=tf.float32),
    lambda: inputs_ta.read(time))
Why make it return an zero input? Will this not cause the last state to be computed incorrectly (with zeros as input)?
Alternatively the zero input can be removed, by rewriting it the following way
elements_finished = (time >= (sequence_length-1))
...
next_input = inputs_ta.read(time)
Thanks
