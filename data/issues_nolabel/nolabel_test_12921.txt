autoconf error when running build_all_ios.sh

When running the build_all_ios.sh script on iOS I am getting the following error:
+ autoreconf -f -i -Wall,no-obsolete configure.ac:30: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow. See the Autoconf documentation. autoreconf: /usr/local/Cellar/autoconf/2.69/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
