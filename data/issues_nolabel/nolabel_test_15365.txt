Automatic node placement (allocating graph nodes to multiple devices) feature  in distributed tensorflow

I read tensorflow white papaer and found node placement which allocates graph nodes to devices without manual configuration.

This post says this feature was removed because it did not perform well.
However, it was posted a year ago and I think you are still developing this feature.
Is it included in the current version of tensorflow?
If so, what code do i need to see?
If inot, do you plan to add this feature?
