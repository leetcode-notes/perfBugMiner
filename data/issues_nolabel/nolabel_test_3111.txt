word2vec_basic : Unique nodes clustering

Hi !
I am getting the output of word2vec_basic.py in the following format
Nearest to key1  : node1, node2, node3 ..
Nearest to key2 : node2, node4, node5 ..


This implies that node2 is comparatively closer to key2 over key1 (Please correct me if I am wrong, as I am newbie here)
It would be great if I get the output in the following format
Nearest to key1  : node1, node3 , node6..
Nearest to key2 : node2, node4, node5 ..


That is, consider only the closest neighbor for clustering. Suggestions are welcome!
Appreciate the hardwork behind tensorflow üëç
Thanks!
