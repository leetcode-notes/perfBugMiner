Feature tf.image : scale image and keep aspect/ratio

Hi, I'm working on a FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) and use Tensorflow for this work. I have a lot of images in input, and they have very different dimensions, like 2340x4160 or 512x512. So my input need to be dynamic. It's why I search a way to resize images for having the greater dimension to a specific value, with respect to the aspect/ratio.
Unfortunatly, Tensorflow doesn't provide this feature or, if I'm wrong, please just ignore this issue.
So I write my own code. (It's probably not the most beautiful way to write this, sorry if this code seems ugly!)
#!/usr/bin/env python
import tensorflow as tf

MAX_SIZE = 512

# Image (for example: 2340x4160)
image_path = "your_image.jpg"

# Open image
image_string = tf.read_file(image_path)
image        = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_string, channels=3)

# Take width/height
initial_width = tf.shape(image)[0]
initial_height = tf.shape(image)[1]

# Function for resizing 
def _resize(x, y):
  # Take the greater value, and use it for the ratio 
  max_ = tf.maximum(initial_width, initial_height)
  ratio = tf.to_float(max_) / tf.constant(MAX_SIZE, dtype=tf.float32)

  new_width = tf.to_float(initial_width) / ratio
  new_height = tf.to_float(initial_height) / ratio

  return tf.to_int32(new_width), tf.to_int32(new_height)

# Useless function for the next condition
def _useless(x, y):
  return x, y

new_w, new_h = tf.cond(tf.logical_or(
                         tf.greater(initial_width, tf.constant(MAX_SIZE)),
                         tf.greater(initial_height, tf.constant(MAX_SIZE))
                       ),
        lambda: _resize(initial_width, initial_height),
        lambda: _useless(initial_width, initial_height))

resized_image = tf.image.resize_images(image, [new_w, new_h])
image_int     = tf.cast(resized_image, tf.uint8)
image_enc     = tf.image.encode_jpeg(image_int)
fwrite        = tf.write_file("my_resized_image.jpeg", image_enc)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run([fwrite])
I think this feature could be very useful when working with image input to have a function (here: "tf.image.resize_image_keep_aspect") which allow us to do the operation more quickly (and I hope more efficiently!)
#!/usr/bin/env python
import tensorflow as tf

MAX_SIZE = 512

# Image (for example: 2340x4160)
image_path = "your_image.jpg"

# Open image
image_string  = tf.read_file(image_path)
image         = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_string, channels=3)
resized_image = tf.image.resize_image_keep_aspect(image, MAX_SIZE)
image_enc     = tf.image.encode_jpeg(resized_image)
fwrite        = tf.write_file("my_resized_image.jpeg", image_enc)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run([fwrite])

If the feature already exist, sorry but I search on git/stackoverflow/google and didn't find any viable solution.
If you have any question or if I'm not clear, ask to me.
Have a nice day :)
