Installation error "error: identifier "__shfl_down" is undefined"  (Trying with Compute Capability  2.0)

I'm trying to install tensor flow from source, as I would like to use GPU's
that have compute capability == 2.0. (And I suspect that problems lies here and might be not have a trivial solution)
Environment info
Operating System:
uname -or
3.16.0-4-amd64 GNU/Linux
bazel release 0.2.0
Commit hash
git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1

git log -1 --format="%H"

I use TF_UNOFFICIAL_SETTING=1 ./configure
and  choose Compute Capability  2.0
bazel build -c opt  --config=cuda  --spawn_strategy=standalone --verbose_failures  //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

What seems to be the key-error:
INFO: From Compiling tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_xent_op_gpu.cu.cc:
external/eigen_archive/eigen-eigen-017cff30cf74/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorReductionCuda.h(111): error: identifier "__shfl_down" is undefined
It seems "__shfl_down" was added in Kepler (compute capability == 3.x )
https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/faster-parallel-reductions-kepler/
and as my cards are pre-Kepler, this seems to be the culprit. Can anybody confirm this ? or might there be a solution ?
