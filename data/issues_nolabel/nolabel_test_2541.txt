Add meshgrid function

I needed to use something similar to np.meshgrid in tensorflow and decided to write my own version.
This can be implemented in pure Python by making use of tf.reshape and tf.tile.
I've placed the function in array_ops.py and added a simple test that compares the output to the numpy version.
One thing that's still missing is testing whether the inputs all have rank 1.
Seems like I might have to use tf.rank to check this at runtime.
Would Assert ops be the right tool for that?
