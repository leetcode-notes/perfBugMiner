tensorflow logging glog redefined warning

I just integrated a tensorflow module to my existing c++ project. I was already using glog for logging in my existing project, logging to files.
Now when I build the new project it throws warnings like:
/usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h:254:0: warning: "CHECK_GT" redefined #define CHECK_GT(val1, val2) CHECK_OP(Check_GT, >, val1, val2) /usr/local/include/glog/logging.h:793:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition #define CHECK_GT(val1, val2) CHECK_OP(_GT, > , val1, val2)
Is this behavior safe? I am not concerned that much with the logs that tensorflow generates, I need my existing modules to continue logging to files.
If this behavior is unsafe, this could be a good feature request to have glog logging not affected by tensorflow logging.
