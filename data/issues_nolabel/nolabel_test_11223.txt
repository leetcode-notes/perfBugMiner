tf.gather axis argument

It'd be nice to have an axis argument to tf.gather. This would bring it closer to the numpy equivalent, np.take.
This would also pave the way to supporting Numpy array indexing, e.g. t[:, [0, 2, 3], ::2].
Based on discussion in #9236 and all the remedies provided on this StackOverflow thread, there would be a lot of use for it.
The most common workaround of tf.transpose(tf.gather(tf.transpose(...), ...), ...) is super inefficient.
