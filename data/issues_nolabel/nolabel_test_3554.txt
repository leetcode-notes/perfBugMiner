Different outputs using tensorflow.contrib.learn.Estimator.predict()

I trained a tensorflow model using skflow, but when I tried to predict some new value of my data, things didn't work. This is what is happening.
I have X, the matrix containing the observations.
When I run
y_predicted = classifier.predict(X, batch_size=128)
I'm interested in the output of indexes 855, 15035, 49536, 856, 857
so
y_predicted['class'][(855, 15035, 49536, 856, 857), ]
the results are exactly what I have expected
array([0, 0, 0, 3, 3])
Everything is fine up to here, but if I pass to predict function just the indexes of interest, the results are different. Here is an example:
y_predicted = classifier.predict(X[(855, 15035, 49536, 856, 857), :], batch_size=128)
Then, the output is wrong
`y_predicted['class']``
gives
array([0, 0, 0, 2, 0])
I tried several ways to do this, and I always get the wrong results.
Thank you.
