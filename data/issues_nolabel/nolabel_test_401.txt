Tutorial TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning, path error

In the following tutorial about visualizing TensorBoard is an error: http://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html
The tutorial says the code to run the visualization of the mnist data is:
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/mnist_data

However in the code you provide, you put:
writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter("/tmp/mnist_logs", sess.graph_def)

mnist_data =/= mnist_logs. The right code is:
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/mnist_logs


Additionally would it be possible to explain how TensorBoard takes it current path?
For example, if I change --logdir=/tmp/mnist_logs to --logdir=mnist_logs (to put it in the current directory I'm working in), it correctly makes a new folder mnist_logs. However if I run the following code in the current directory:
 tensorboard --logdir=mnist_logs

TensorBoard cannot find the log file. How would I run tensorboard from the current directory?

On the subject of path clarity, could you add an output which states where TensorBoard looks for the log file? Currently:
Starting TensorBoard on port 6006
(You can navigate to http://localhost:6006)

Could you add:
TensorBoard looks for the log files in: /path/to/folder/
and found a file / didn't find a file
