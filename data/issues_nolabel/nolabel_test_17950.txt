Describe the problem
I used networks in tf.keras.applications and tf.keras.model_to_estimator. I noticed that training loss gets low but validation loss doesn't when I don't use pretrained model and train from scratch. I doubted overfitting so I tried evalutating on training dataset. And get large validation loss althogh traing loss gets low inspite of same dataset. I think parameters of BatchNormalization are not updated when use model_to_estimator. Isn't it a bug?
