fix failed copy for op without outputs but with control outputs

This PR fixed copying op without outputs but with control outputs. This kind of op (which is common, e.g. Assert) is not copied at all before this PR.
btw, I'd like to add tests for my changes but I cannot find how to run bazel tests. There seems to be no guidance for contributions to Tensorflow.
