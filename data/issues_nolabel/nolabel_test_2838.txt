Get placeholder for initial state of nested RNN

For RNN cells, we get the initial state using cell.zero_state() and the last state after processing a sequence using rnn.dynamic_rnn(). However, to use the last state as the initial state for the next run, one must create a tf.placeholder(). As far as I know, currently there is no way to create and fill such  a placeholder (or nested tuple of placeholders) automatically. Such a feature would be very useful so that we don't have to adjust the placeholder manually when changing the RNN cell.
