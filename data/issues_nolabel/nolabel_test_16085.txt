Add unspecified dimensions (-1) support for noise_shape with tf.nn.dropout

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #16034 where it was not possible to have unspecified dimensions for noise_shape with tf.nn.dropout.
This fix adds the support so that it is possible to specify noise_shape = [-1, 1, 1, -1] instead of noise_shape = [k, 1, 1, n].
This fix fixes #16034.
