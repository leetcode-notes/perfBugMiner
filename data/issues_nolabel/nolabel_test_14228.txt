Feature request: an op that returns timestamp

This is useful for stats tracking in distributed TensorFlow (ie, measuring TF communication latency between workers and plotting it in TensorBoard). Perhaps it could be called CurrentTimestamp, tf.current_timestamp()
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"
static EnvTime* env_time = tensorflow::EnvTime::Default();
uint64 now_micros = env_time->NowMicros();
