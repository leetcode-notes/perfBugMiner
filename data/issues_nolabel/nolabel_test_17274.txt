Unable to get FLOPs on model with tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian/Sid
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary, tensorflow-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.0/CuDNN v7
GPU model and memory: GTX1080, 8GB

Running the model under benchmark_model, I'm unable to get any FLOPs value, and there are several strange pieces in the output:
