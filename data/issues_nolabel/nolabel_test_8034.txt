SparseTensor constructor change not noted as a breaking change in 1.0

The shape keyword argument of the SparseTensor constructor changes its name to dense_shape between Tensorflow 0.12 (relevant API document) and Tensorflow 1.0 (relevant API document).  However, this is neither documented on the migration page nor handled by the migration script.
