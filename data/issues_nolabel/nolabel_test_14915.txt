Very different CPU usage/allocation behavior when using slightly different CPUs

I am running the same exact model on two largely similar systems, let's call them system A and B. However, TF's behavior is very different. On system A, CPU utilization is around 60% (on a 12-core system), while on system B CPU utilization is only around 8%. Moreover, on system A the same model runs about 10x slower than system B, even though it's using far fewer CPU resources.
The systems are similar in that they're both running:
Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow 1.4.0 (compiled from source)
Python 2.7
gcc 4.8.4
What's different:
System A:
Bazel 0.6.0
2x E5-2643 v3
System B:
Bazel 0.7.0
2x E5-2643 v4
Why would they behave so differently?
