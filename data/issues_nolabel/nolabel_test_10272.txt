Fixed fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler docs

Implementation of tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler (https://github.com/waleedka/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/range_sampler.cc#L273) seems that the range of reserved ids is [0, num_reserved_ids).
Fixed the docstring about num_reserved_ids.
