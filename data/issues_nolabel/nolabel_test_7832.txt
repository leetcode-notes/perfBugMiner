Android Improvements

This branch adds minor improvements to TensorFlow on Android.


e02edef lowers API support to level 14 — which is confirmed to work, rather than level 21 as indicated right now. This setting is commented out by default, but could be a useful guideline to most users. It might be more interesting to update the CI server to naturally produce nightly builds at that level, but it doesn’t seem like I can send a PR for that (unless I missed it).


5971f69 introduces the use of GC sections when compiling libtensorflow_inference.so, which has the effect of reducing final binary size.
At the time of this PR, the following improvements were observed:
