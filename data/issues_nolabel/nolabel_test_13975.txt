begin_shift_axis not defined in tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm

The live version of tensorflow's api docs here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/layer_norm
Refer to begin_shift_axis, which isn't defined.  I assume this is a typo and is meant to be begin_params_axis
Apologies if documentation bugs are supposed to be tracked elsewhere, it's not clear how those should be reported.
