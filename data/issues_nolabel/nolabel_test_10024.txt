Text summary: Error encountered when serializing __tensorboard_plugin_asset__tensorboard_text.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux CentOS 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.1.0-rc2-1185-ge4f5123' 1.2.0-rc0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 5.1.10
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf

logdir = "/output_dir"
text = "A text summary"
text_tensor = tf.constant(text)
text_summary = tf.summary.text("Summary", text_tensor)
merged = tf.summary.merge([text_summary])
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(logdir, tf.get_default_graph())
s = tf.Session()
s.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
summary = s.run(merged)
writer.add_summary(summary)

Describe the problem
Tensorflow  gives the following error when I try to create a summary writer when the graph has a text summary:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing __tensorboard_plugin_asset__tensorboard_text.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
'TextSummaryPluginAsset' object has no attribute 'name'

On my larger project I was able to output some text to the summary page on tensorboard, but the Markdown I put in there wasn't being parsed at all. I don't know if these problems are related but I feel like they probably are.
