Docker Build Error

I am building tf dockerimages for both cuda 8.0 and 7.5 from source. But both cames error at bazel build procedure with message:

The command '/bin/sh -c tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/configured GPU     bazel build -c opt --config=cuda tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package &&     bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/pip &&     pip --no-cache-dir install --upgrade /tmp/pip/tensorflow-*.whl &&     rm -rf /tmp/pip &&     rm -rf /root/.cache' returned a non-zero code: 2

some times there would be an additional message like:

ERROR: Evaluation of query "deps(((//tensorflow/... - //tensorflow/contrib/nccl/...) - //tensorflow/examples/android/...))" failed: errors were encountered while computing transitive closure

I cloned r1.1 branch and mainly followed the scripts in original dockerfile(devel-gpu version), with only python and cuda env modified. Also I found that original dockerfile would also meet same issue.
I guess it might be caused by some download error when getting dependencies from bazel-mirror on googleapis.
Is that possible to manually download those packages or try some alternative way like disable some function? Any hint?
