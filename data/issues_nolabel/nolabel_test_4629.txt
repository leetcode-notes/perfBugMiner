C++ ShapeInference / ShapeRefiner use without PlaceHolder/ConstantOp support

The ShapeInference for C++ engine doesn't support the PlaceholderOp.  Is this because it isn't finished, or am I missing something?
It seems to be that you can't add a node to the shape inference engine without having added its dependencies.  Since ConsantOp and PlaceholderOp do not have a shape inference functions, I don't understand how the ShapeRefiner can have any nodes added to it.
