tf.contrib.rnn module object is not callable.

I am trying to run a tutorial (http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html) and have some issue with modules that have moved.
I researched a bit and found that some classes have moved and fixed:
tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicRNNCell(state_size)
to
tf.contrib.rnn.BasicRNNCell(state_size)
This works now.
However, I have this function I can't seem to fix:
rnn_outputs, final_state = tf.nn.rnn(cell, rnn_inputs, initial_state=init_state)
--> as expected, says: module 'tensorflow.python.ops.nn' has no attribute 'rnn'
So I tried:
rnn_outputs, final_state = tf.contrib.rnn(cell, rnn_inputs, initial_state=init_state)
But that says: 'module' object is not callable
I am using python3 (tried 2 as well), with a fresh installed TensorFlow 1.0.0 through pip3.
I tried looking at the API, but it's not making much sense to me, as I am still going through the tutorial to try to understand what is happening. I would think maybe the arguments have changed, or maybe this is in a sub-function now? https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/rnn
