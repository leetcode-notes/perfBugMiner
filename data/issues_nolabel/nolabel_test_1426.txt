Is CentOS 6.5 supported?

I have try each method in installation guide to install GPU-tensorflow in my centos 6.5 server?
However, the error below is still exists.
ImportError: /lib64/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.14 not found (required by /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so)
Is there anyone who've successfully installed tensor flow in centos 6.5?
