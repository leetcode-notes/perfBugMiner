Script for Jenkins parameterized matrix build

The script takes a few environment variables as input and invoke
ci_build.sh in the same directory in the proper way. It takes
information about the build type (cpu | gpu | android), Python version,
whether "-c opt" is used and whether PIP install-test is to be
performed. It automatically examines the parameters to determine the
correct build script to call and the argument flags to use with it. It
also examines whether Docker is available on the system to determine
whether the build will be done inside Docker or not. If GPU Docker build
is detectd, it'll map the CUDA devices and libraries automatically.
In addition, it looks at some optional environment variables to set
additional command flags for Docker and the build command.
