"When a function is called to perform an overlapped operation, the operation might be completed before the function returns. When this happens, the results are handled as if the operation had been performed synchronously. If the operation was not completed, however, the function's return value is FALSE, and the GetLastError function returns ERROR_IO_PENDING."
