Unable to install tensorflow-gpu==0.11.0

I am having issues with installing the v0.11.0 version of tensorflow-gpu. My code works on tensorflow==0.11.0 but really slow. I had a tensorflow-gpu==0.11.0 but i had lost it due to an upgrade. The pip repository doesn't have a v0.11 anymore and starts with v0.12 only. I got the v0.11 wheel from the TF_BINARY_URLs for v0.11. I am able to install tensorflow==0.11.0 using the wheel at export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
but I am unable to install the GPU version of tensorflow-gpu==0.11.0 using the corresponding link at export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
The link looks same to me with just the folder different from gpu/ and cpu/. Upon using the link for GPU, it installs tensorflow==0.11.0 and not tensorflow-gpu=0.11.0. Where can I find a tensorflow-gpu==0.11.0 wheel?
