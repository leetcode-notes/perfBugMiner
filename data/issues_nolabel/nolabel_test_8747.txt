Fix broken link in Android example README

Issue  #8742 identified that the link to os_setup.html does not work for the master version.
os_setup.html is still available for old versions ( https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup#prepare_environment_for_linux ), but it makes more sense to link directly to the Bazel installation instructions.
