histogram_summary does not respect name_scope

I am getting a Duplicate tag error when I try to write out histogram summaries for a multi-layer network that I generate procedurally. The problem is that the name given to a histogram_summary (and I assume all summaries) does not respect name_scope. As a consequence, the names are not unique. This seems like a bug.
For example, in:
with tf.name_scope(some_unique_name):
  ...
  _ = tf.histogram_summary('weights', kernel_weights)

I'd assume that 'weights' would be scoped to some_unique_name but I'm suspecting that it is not. I added code to make the names unique and the Duplicate tag problem goes away.
