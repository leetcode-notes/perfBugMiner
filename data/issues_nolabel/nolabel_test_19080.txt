Make canned estimators compute PR-AUC with right method.

As we are sure about the error produced by computing PR-AUC with trapezoidal rule according to this commit.
And also i found there is no proper workaround to make a canned estimator(Let's say DNNClassifier) to compute PR-AUC with the right method careful_interpolation.
Then, i did a simple change to this embarrassed situation: #19079
Does anyone can confirm this for me?
Update template content:

Have I written custom code: No, i just use a canned estimator DNNClassifier.
