label_image example does not work with Mobilenetv1 (224)

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No.


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mac OS X 10.12.5


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source


TensorFlow version (use command below):
Github tag 1.2 release


Python version:
2.7 (Mac OS X System install)


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Homebrew 0.4.5


CUDA/cuDNN version:
NA


GPU model and memory:
NA


Exact command to reproduce:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image --image=/Path/to/image.jpg --input_layer=input --output_layer=MobilenetV1/Predictions/Reshape_1 --graph=/Path/To/my/trained/mobilenet.pb --labels=/Path/To/My/labels.txt --input_mean=0 --input_std=255


Describe the problem
Ive retrained MobileNetV1 (224) via the TF Slim readme.md and have produced a graph.pb trained against a data set with 5 labels to classify. I am attempting to validate my training by running the exported graph on some validation and training data myself, and have build label_image and specified the above flags  to run.
Its unclear if label image is expected  able to run MobileNet , but it does not: it errors with:
