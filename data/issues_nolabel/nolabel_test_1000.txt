tensorboard script fails due to failing import

It seems commit 8a59748 has done this move:  tensorflow/tensorboard/{ â†’ backend}/tensorboard.py but the import in the tensorboard script that gets installed by pip uses the old location (I think that's defined by https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L46 ). Thus, invoking tensorboard fails with a failing import, but if you insert "backend." into the script at the appropriate location it works again.
