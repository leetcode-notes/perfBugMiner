Build is failing on Linux GPU

Hi,
I'm trying with no luck to build TF for OpenCL from source. I configured a new installed machine as is described in your guide but the build is failing.
I'm launching the build through this command:
bazel build -c opt --config=sycl //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
And below you can find all the requested informations from my OS. In attach you'll find the Errors the compiler shows me.
I've tryed also to build with clang against GCC/G++ with no luck.
Errors TF.txt
Thank you
