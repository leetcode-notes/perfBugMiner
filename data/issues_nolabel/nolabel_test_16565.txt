Feature Request: Separated Name Spaces of RNN Cells for hidden weights and recurrent states

This feature request is based on the following question of StackOverflow, if it's not appropriate I will close this issue.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48506422/indices-and-slicing-of-tensorflows-global-variables-of-kernels-for-hidden-weigh
placeholders = {"inputs":tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, 1000])}
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(80)
outs, states = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=cell, inputs=placeholders["inputs"], dtype=tf.float32)

This graph building gives us tf.global_variables() list as follows:
[<tf.Variable 'rnn/basic_lstm_cell/kernel:0' shape=(1080, 320) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'rnn/basic_lstm_cell/bias:0' shape=(320,) dtype=float32_ref>]

The proposed new feature separates two name spaces of "kernel": hidden weights and recurrent states
The expected tf.gloabal_variables() list with new feature is as follows:
 [<tf.Variable 'rnn/basic_lstm_cell/kernel/hidden_weights:0' shape=(1000, 320) dtype=float32_ref>,<tf.Variable 'rnn/basic_lstm_cell/kernel/recurrent_state:0' shape=(80, 320) dtype=float32_ref>,<tf.Variable 'rnn/basic_lstm_cell/bias:0' shape=(320,) dtype=float32_ref>]

In the new feature, a kernel name space has two sub spaces.
rnn/basic_lstm_cell/kernel/hidden_weights
rnn/basic_lstm_cell/kernel/recurrent_state
