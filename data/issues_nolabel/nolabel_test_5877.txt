GraphKeys.VARIABLES deprecated early

GraphKeys.VARIABLES was intended to be deprecated next march according to the code.
But here it is set as a property. Therefore back-compatibility of GraphKeys.VARIABLES is already broken now because one has to use GraphKeys().VARIABLES instead.
It should something like a classproperty instead.
