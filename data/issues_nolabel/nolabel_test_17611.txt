Describe the problem
TypeError: __new__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'output_alternatives' is thrown on line 611 in _scale_tower_loss function in tensorflow/contrib/estimator/python/estimator/replicate_model_fn.py
It can be resolved by adding del estimator_spec['output_alternatives']:
  """Produce an EstimatorSpec with approproriately scaled loss."""
  if tower_spec.loss is None:
    return tower_spec

  estimator_spec = _asdict(tower_spec)
  estimator_spec['loss'] = _scale_loss(tower_spec.loss, loss_reduction,
                                       number_of_towers)
  del estimator_spec['output_alternatives'] # RESOLVES THE ISSUE
  return model_fn_lib.EstimatorSpec(**estimator_spec)

After running grep command, I have noticed that output_alternatives variable is mostly used in tensorflow/contrib/learn. My guess is that output_alternatives  was forgotten to be removed from the new  tf.estimator.Estimator as it is only used by the old tf.contrib.learn.Estimator.
