I am unable to extract the hidden layer values from Seq2Seq model in Tensorflow for NMt

Has anyone tried to extract the hidden layer values since the code explicitly doesn't specify the hidden layer  in translate.py or in seq2seq_model.py. ?
tensorflow version: 1.0
OS : CentOS
Python: 2.7
Is there any other program i need to look into for printing the hidden layer values?
