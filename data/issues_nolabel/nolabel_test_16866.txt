Support for Android Gradle Plugin 2.3.3

Hello folks,
Trying to use Tensorflow lite (compiled manually) with android gradle plugin 2.3.3,  I get the following error:

Error:Error converting bytecode to dex:
Cause: Dex cannot parse version 52 byte code.
This is caused by library dependencies that have been compiled using Java 8 or above.
If you are using the 'java' gradle plugin in a library submodule add
targetCompatibility = '1.7'
sourceCompatibility = '1.7'
to that submodule's build.gradle file.

I do understand that there's the 3.0.1 version and it work, but it has many breaking changes and it is not trivial to bump the plugin version. It there any workaround or is there support for 2.3.3 on the road map?
Thanks!
