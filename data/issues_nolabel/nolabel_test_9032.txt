Describe the problem clearly
This is a feature request to add documentation.
As recommended by the GCP Cloud ML Engine documentation (specifically the code used by this tutorial), I am attempting to use tf.contrib.learn's learn_runner interface for training. However, I cannot figure out how to configure the checkpoint saving behaviour. Normally, I would just post a Stackoverflow question, but I feel that this interface would benefit greatly from some official documentation, especially as it is being recommended by GCP.
The closest I could get to documentation on this specific issue is a cryptic comment.
