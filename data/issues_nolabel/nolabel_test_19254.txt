Add additional shape validation to `compute_accidental_hits`

In compute_accidental_hits, the sampled_candidates must
be a vector, as is shown in the kernel implementation in
tensorflow/core/kernels/candidate_sampler_ops.cc.
This fix adds shape validation of sampled_candidates
in the shape function whenever possible.
