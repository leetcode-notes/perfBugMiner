Fix symbol duplication for iOS on Xcode/clang

I tried to use Tensorflow on iPhone.
I successfully created library files for iOS (libtensorflow-core-*.a)
using tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh.
But when I tried to use the library, following linker error happened on Xcode:
duplicate symbol __Z14tf_git_versionv in:
    /Users/admin/tmp/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/simple/../../makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a(version_info.o)
duplicate symbol __Z19tf_compiler_versionv in:
    /Users/admin/tmp/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/simple/../../makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a(version_info.o)
ld: 2 duplicate symbols for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

These functions are defined in tensorflow/core/util/version_info.cc.
It seems the object file is added twice in Makefile:
($(wildcard tensorflow/core/util/*.cc) and tensorflow/core/util/version_info.cc)
The source file version_info.cc is generated from a script
and not included in the repository,
so adding the source file to CORE_CC_ALL_SRCS manually on line 431 is necessary.
But once it is generated, it is listed on $(wildcard tensorflow/core/util/*.cc) too, and added twice.
Using $(sort ...) function removes this duplication and solves the problem.
