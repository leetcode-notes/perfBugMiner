(skflow) issue in batch normalization after restore

Hi,
I'm using Tensorflow last succeed build #85
I succeed to train a classifier with batch normalization and saving it with classifier.save(logdir) and restoring the classifier with
classifier = tf.contrib.skflow.TensorFlowEstimator.restore(logdir)
the classifier is restored but when using prediction classifier.predict(X_test) it seems that the batch normalization is applied as is in Training mode.
Looking to the code of batch normalization (batch_norm_ops.py)
is_training = array_ops_.squeeze(ops.get_collection("IS_TRAINING")) mean, variance = control_flow_ops.cond(is_training, update_mean_var, lambda: (ema_mean, ema_var))
I suppose as the graph is loaded in restore step, the "IS_TRAINING" is defined at the state of True at the saved step. and the cond function used will be update_mean_var at predict step , however the "IS_TRAINING" is changed at _predict step.
you can detect the problem when classifying 2 class problem and adding a batch normalization before the softmax the mean of the softmax of any tested data will be 0.
Maybe a solution will be to use a placeholder in place of the variable is_training
Or I'm missing something ?
