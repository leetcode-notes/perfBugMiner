Tensorboard: missing variable name/label

When I run the MNIST example with tensorboard (v0.6.0) and look at the graph, the bias variable is unnamed (just Variable).  If I switch the order that the variables are defined, I can make it so that the weights variable is unnamed.
It looks like perhaps the name of the last variable defined isn't captured in the graph_def?  Or perhaps tensorboard isn't picking up the name of the last variable defined?
