can't use all the CPU cores

I'm running the ptb example on my 48-core Intel Skylake CPUs (two sockets).
However, I found only 10 of the 48 cores are being used (I used the 'top' command). I want to use all the cores.
I tried the following setting, but it did not work
config_proto = tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=soft_placement, inter_op_parallelism_threads=4, intra_op_parallelism_threads=12)
