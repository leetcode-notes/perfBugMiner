mu to learning_rate

New var mu defined as Learning rate:
mu = 0.002
but later in the same code cell var learning_rate is used instead:
update_weights = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate).minimize(loss)
, which was defined in previous cell:
Suggest to rename because cell uses var which is not defined in it, but
defines var which is not used.
Suggest to rename mu to learning_rate (not learning_rate to mu later in
code) because this code cell is supposed to be like previous but with
comments. And in previous cell the name learning_rate was used.
Commit also change var name in comment to reflect changes in var
definition.
