improved and fix bug of getting next batch in mnist

The original codes do not consider the situation that when the batch_size > num_examples (even though it is not a common event, if happens, no new data will be input at all).
Actually, a fully epoch means that all examples have been applied once, however, the original codes do not show it. If the batch_size sets just a little bit larger than half of the example number, nearly half of the examples cannot be used in one epoch.
Also, I set the shuffle to be a input variable.
