Cuda 3.0 not working

When installing from pip tensorflow GPU version (Linux), minimum cuda version is 3.5.
Install instructions have been changed to:
"TensorFlow GPU support requires having a GPU card with NVidia Compute Capability >= 3.0"
However, gpu_device.cc is still requiring cuda 3.5:
// "configure" uses the specific name to substitute the following string.
// If you change it, make sure you modify "configure" as well.
std::vector<CudaVersion> supported_cuda_compute_capabilities = {
    CudaVersion("3.5"), CudaVersion("5.2")};

}  // namespace
