missing line of code in get_started tutorial on website

as mentioned by an issue closed 19 days ago #11042 there is a line missing in the tutorial code at https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started#a_custom_model.
this earlier issue was closed, but on the current version of the site that i see, the issue still persists.
the missing line is:
eval_input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x": x_eval}, y_eval,4, num_epochs=1000)
which should appear after:
input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x": x_train}, y_train, 4, num_epochs=1000)
please note that these same lines appear in the code above the mentioned block in the "basic usage" section.
also, i hope opening a new issue is the correct action in this case. if i should have done something else, please let me know
