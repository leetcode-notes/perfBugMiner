Something wrong while using C++ Session.Run api.

I use tensorflow C++ api to run my model. I flower this reference: label_image.
In my model, the outputs' shape is 2d,  I run model like this:
std::vector<Tensor> outputs;
status = session->Run(m_feed_dict, {"model/wav_outputs"},{}, &outputs);
However, I get this:
tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:44] Check failed: NDIMS == dims() (1 vs. 2)Asking for tensor of 1 dimensions from a tensor of 2 dimensions
Could anybody tell me how to fix this?
