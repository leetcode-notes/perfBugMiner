Steps to reproduce

./configure with GPU support in /usr/local/cuda
build tests with --config=cuda option


What have you tried?

building tests without --config=cuda has no problem
made sure libcudart.so.7.5 exists in /usr/local/cuda/lib64 (as a soft link to libcudart.so.7.5.18)
./configure with /usr/local/cuda/lib64 (says file not found)
