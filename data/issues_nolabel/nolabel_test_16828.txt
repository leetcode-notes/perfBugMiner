Code size with XLA AOT

I currently research about xla using AOT compilation and use Cifar10 as benchmark
After using AOT compilation, I got a binary file that size is 5.3MB, but the original tensorflow graph's size is about 4.2MB. Does it means a using AOT compilation can't promise always reduce code size efficiently?
