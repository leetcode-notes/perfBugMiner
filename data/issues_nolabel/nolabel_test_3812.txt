Tensorflow distributed training question: Do we have to manually copy ckpt files from worker 0  to ps servers?

Operating System:
Linux XNLPEXP2 4.4.0-24-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 8 19:27:37 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Azure VM 8 cores, 56GB memory
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
pip 8.1.2 from /home/xubixiong/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
0.10.0rc0
When I am trying to restore training from latest checkpoint, I found that I have to copy checkpoint files to ps servers, from worker 0.
Is it the right and recommended way? Or I did something wrong? ?
