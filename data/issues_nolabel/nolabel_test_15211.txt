Deep MNIST - exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): I have copied all the code lines from the tutorial Deep MNIST for Experts manually into a python file.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux, kernel: 4.13.12-1-ARCH
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-rc1-11-g130a514 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: accuracy.eval(feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels, keep_prob: 1.0})

Describe the problem
I am trying to run the example code from the tutorial Deep MNIST for Experts by copying every line from the tutorial into a python file and running it. The first part of the script with the model with a single linear layer runs fine, but the second part with a multilayer convolutional network fails to run. When the last line of the script executes: print('test accuracy %g' % accuracy.eval(feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels, keep_prob: 1.0})) I get the following error: Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV).
I tried to evaluate the accuracy with a batch of size 50 from the testing data instead of supplying mnist.test.images and mnist.test.labels and that worked fine.
I was directed here from Stackoverflow because this was believed to be a bug (Stackoverflow question).
Source code / logs
I am unfamiliar with gdb so if I have missed to provide any relevant debugging output I'll try to add it if you can tell me how to get it.
