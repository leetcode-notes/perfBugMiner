Setting lower gcc version for cuda

gcc 4.10 and up are not supported for the required cuda toolkit.  How can I specify a different version of gcc to bazel?  I tried setting a new version with --compiler, but it reported that no toolchain was found.  Do I need to provide a CROSSTOOL file or is there an easier way?
