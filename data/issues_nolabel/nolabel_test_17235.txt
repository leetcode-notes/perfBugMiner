Clean up output formatting of saved_model_cli.py

The output of saved_model_cli.py was a bit hard to read, so I added some indentation to make the variable/graph information easier to take in at a glance.
Before:
MetaGraphDef with tag-set: 'serve' contains the following SignatureDefs:

signature_def['classify_x2_to_y3']:
The given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following input(s):
inputs['inputs'] tensor_info:
    dtype: DT_FLOAT
    shape: (-1, 1)
    name: x2:0
The given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following output(s):
outputs['scores'] tensor_info:
    dtype: DT_FLOAT
    shape: (-1, 1)
    name: y3:0
Method name is: tensorflow/serving/classify

After:
MetaGraphDef with tag-set: 'serve' contains the following SignatureDefs:

signature_def['classify_x2_to_y3']:
  The given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following input(s):
    inputs['inputs'] tensor_info:
        dtype: DT_FLOAT
        shape: (-1, 1)
        name: x2:0
  The given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following output(s):
    outputs['scores'] tensor_info:
        dtype: DT_FLOAT
        shape: (-1, 1)
        name: y3:0
  Method name is: tensorflow/serving/classify

I updated the documentation and unit tests accordingly.
I also fixed the formatting of some of the "usage" messages in saved_model_cli.py.
