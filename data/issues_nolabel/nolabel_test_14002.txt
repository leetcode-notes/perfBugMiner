Bazel build for CUDA failed on Ubuntu w/ lastest tip + CUDNN 6.0 + CUDA 8.0

Hi,
I am trying to build latest TF with CUDNN 6.0 + CUDA 8.0 on Ubuntu 14 but it failed with the following error message. I found some similar issue (#469) reported in the past, not sure if the latest tip has fixed it?
Any suggestion would be appreciated.
Thanks
Build Command


build command for CUDA that failed
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package


build for CPU works well
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package


System Info

bazel version : Build label: 0.5.4
CUDA: 8.0
CUDNN 6.0
