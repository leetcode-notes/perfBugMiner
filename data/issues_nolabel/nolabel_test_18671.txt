[feature request] should tf.name_scope be deprecated in favor tf.variable_scope

Hi everyone.
Describe the problem
From my understanding, I believe that the main difference between tf.name_scope vs tf.variable_scope is that tf.name_scope only records ops while tf.variable_scope records both ops and variables in the graph.
Then here's the question that I'm raising, why is it still necessary to have both. IMHO it seems like a redundancy and unnecessarily cluttering the style of the code when you write since you can achieve the same and more with tf.variable_scope.
Should tf.name_scope be removed in a future release?
