Describe the problem
I have put together a script to build a distribution of TensorFlow for C++ development. Part of this script invokes tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh. However, this fails with the following output(truncated, error is the same for each subsequent download):

It appears that maybe the download URL's are out of date. If this is indeed a bug, it should be reproducible on Linux with the attached script(which should be sufficiently commented.).
