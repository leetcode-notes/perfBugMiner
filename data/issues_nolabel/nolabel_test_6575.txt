does not work on my dataset

Linux Unbuntu
Python 2.7
I did run word2vec_basic.py example successfully but as i change dataset from text8.zip to mydata.zip, i get following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "../../statistics/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py", line 218, in 
close_word = reverse_dictionary[nearest[k]]
KeyError: 21049
i have checked, my data is loading successfully in data array
