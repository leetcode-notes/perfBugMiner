The output_type of NodeDef should support DT_INT64

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OSX
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): None
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce: None

Describe the problem
Now we try to export the model to be load in Android and iOS devices. The exported operators includes tf.argmax which has the output_type of long(tf.DT_INT64). Once the model is used for inference it throws these error.
2018-02-09 10:45:15.690271: E /Users/tobe/code/tensorflow_template_application/ios_client/RunModelViewController.mm:194] Running model failed: Invalid argument: NodeDef mentions attr 'output_type' not in Op<name=ArgMax; signature=input:T, dimension:Tidx -> output:int64; attr=T:type,allowed=[DT_FLOAT, DT_INT32, DT_QINT8, DT_QUINT8, DT_QINT32]; 

The source code about this operator is in https://github.com/tobegit3hub/tensorflow_template_application/blob/master/dense_classifier.py#L422 .
I'm not really digging into the code why it supports float and int only. It would be great if it can support more output_types so that the models don't less modification for deployment.
