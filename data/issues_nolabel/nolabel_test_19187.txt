Use "```" (backtick) for code blocks in adding_an_op.md

In adding_an_op.md, most of the code blocks uses "```" (3 backticks)
and annotations are added automatically. Though there was one
place where the code block are done with manual html code. This
is really error-prune and hard to change if there is an update
in the future.
This fix converts to "```c++" (backticks) so that it is easy to maintain in the future.
