Feature Request: Erosion2d and Dilation2d implemented on GPU

Hi everybody!
Erosion2d and Dilation2d can be used for various reason. e.g. Ronneberg et al. compute a weight map using morphological operations for their cost function. This can be done using morphological Erosions and Dilations but those operations are quite slow on CPU. It seems Tensorflow do not use the GPU for those operation. Would it be possible to have those two operations implemented on GPU?
