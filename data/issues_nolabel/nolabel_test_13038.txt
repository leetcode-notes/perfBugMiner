Describe the problem
I encounter the following error while building the tensorflow project for image recognition (tf_label_image_example.vcxproj). The error occurs when this image recognition project builds tf_core_gpu_kernels.vcxproj.
error : argument list for template "cub::BlockReduce<T, BLOCK_DIM_X, ALGORITHM, BLOCK_DIM_Y, BLOCK_DIM_Z, PTX_ARCH>::Reduce [with T=std::iterator_tra its::value_type, BLOCK_DIM_X=num_threads, ALGORITHM=cub::BLOCK_REDUCE_WARP_REDUCTIONS, BLOCK_DIM_Y=1, BLOCK_DIM_Z=1, PTX_ARCH=0]" is missing.
