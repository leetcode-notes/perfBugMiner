the learning_rate became nan in seq2seq model

I use the seq2seq provided by tensorflow, a very curious problem is that the learning_rate will become nan only when the length of the bucket is more than 40 with 4 layers.
The learning_rate should be decaied and more and more smaller, why it will became nan?
The init learning_rate is 0.01 and the learning_rate_decay_factor is 0.5
The training data is nist
The training is in a centos with four K40 together.
