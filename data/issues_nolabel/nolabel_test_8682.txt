Retrained inception v3 model from retrain.py takes 8-10 seconds to classify an image vs 1-2 seconds taken by sample TFClassify application

Hi,
I am using tensorflow image classification in my project.
Initially i built and installed Camera Demo from GitHub link : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android
Case 1: On running this example application (TFClassify) it is taking 1 or 2 seconds to do classification and shows result.
(On the other hand)
Case 2: If I use my retrained inception V3 model (which I have retrained using retrain.py) in same example application by placing the retrained model and labels fie in assets package it is taking 8- 10 seconds to classify per image.
Example application is using inception 5h model i guess and retrain.py is using inception V3 - I am not sure that the difference in classification time is because of this difference in models used, if so I could not find a way to use inception 5h model in retrain.py, it is giving an error :
_ValueError: Requested return_element 'pool_3/reshape:0' not found in graph_def.
Is there a way to reduce the image classification time for the retrained inception V3 model?
Thanks
