Loading TF 1.1 model in TF 1.4

There is a model which has been trained in TF 1.1 (it's a seq2seq model with bahdanau attention). It uses DynamicAttentionWrapper (which has been renamed to AttentionWrapper). After updating TF to version 1.4 and switching to renamed AttentionWrapper the model can't be loaded. I get multiple errors like the following:

Setting name to dynamic_attention_wrapper in AttentionWrapper constructor parameters does not resolve the issue. Am I missing something? Taking into account that production models take a lot of resources to be trained it would be good for them to be compatible between TF versions.  Thank you.
