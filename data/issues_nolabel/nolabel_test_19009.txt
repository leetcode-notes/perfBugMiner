Incorrect results if set "-c 100" in TFLite label_image example

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
**OS Platform and Distribution: Android:
**TensorFlow installed from binary:
**TensorFlow version: 1.6:
**Python version 2.7:
**Bazel version: 0.11.1:
**CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
**GPU model and memory: N/A

Exact command to reproduce:
label_image -b 128 -s 128 -i example.bmp -l labels_mobilenet_quant_v1_224.txt -m mobilenet_quant_v1_224.tflite -c 100

Describe the problem
Incorrect results if set "-c 100" in TFLite label_image example. If only loop once, the result is correct, but if loop more than once, then the results somehow are all incorrect.
