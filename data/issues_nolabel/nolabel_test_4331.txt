Problem with using tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou

I am trying to use tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou in my network and I am getting following Error.
W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:940] Failed precondition: Attempting to use uninitialized value mean_iou/total_confusion_matrix

It seems to me that there might be some bug in the tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iousince all the variables are already initialised.
I am using it as follows:
accuracy_increment, iou_increment = self.session.run(
                [self.accuracy, self.mean_iou], feed_dict={
                self.X: eval_patches[
                        q * self.microbatch_size:
                        q * self.microbatch_size +
                        self.microbatch_size],
                self.Y: eval_labels[
                        q * self.microbatch_size:
                        q * self.microbatch_size +
                        self.microbatch_size],
                self.p_keep_conv: 1})

And the mean iou is computed in the object as:
self.mean_iou, _ = tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou(
            self.predictions, tf.argmax(self.Y, dimension=3), num_classes=2)

I am using from source build tensorflow (branch r10.0) and it's happening to me on both CPU and GPU.
I am not 100% sure that I am using the tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou correctly, but I have played with that a lot, but there is quite lack of the documentation, so I am currently stuck assuming that there is either some bug in the tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou or not enough documentation for me to make it work.
I thank in advance anyone for any comments.
