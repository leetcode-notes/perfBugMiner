Graph transform : fold_constant issue since tf v 1.5

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux centos 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): with pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0 (vs 1.4.1)
Python version: 2.7.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): No
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): No
CUDA/cuDNN version: No
GPU model and memory: No
Exact command to reproduce:

Clone the tensorflow/models repo.
then
cd models/research/slim/
python export_inference_graph.py \
  --model_name=inception_v1 \
  --image_size=224 \
  --output_file=/tmp/inception_v1.pb

Then freeze the graph :
cd tensorflow/tensorflow/python/tools/
python freeze_graph.py \
--input_graph /tmp/inception_v1.pb \
--input_checkpoint /tmp/inception_v1.ckpt \
--output_graph /tmp/inception_v1_frozen.pb \
--input_binary True \
--output_node_names "InceptionV1/Logits/Predictions/Reshape_1"

Then in python do :
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.core.framework import graph_pb2
from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile
import tensorflow.tools.graph_transforms as graph_transforms
graph = graph_pb2.GraphDef()
with open("/tmp/inception_v1_frozen.pb", 'rb') as f:
    s = f.read()
    graph.ParseFromString(s)
graph = graph_transforms.TransformGraph(graph,
            ["input"], # inputs nodes
            ["InceptionV1/Logits/Predictions/Reshape_1"], # outputs nodes
            ['fold_constants()'])
with gfile.FastGFile("/tmp/inception_v1_frozen"+"_optimized.pbtxt", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(graph))

Describe the problem
I am using the graph_transform to fold constants in by graph saved as .pb.
When I use the fold_constants() transformation, some inputs of some nodes are renamed but not the corresponding nodes in the whole graph. So the graph is no longer valid...
I have an "input" placeholder in the graph.
And the node connected to this placeholder as an input name "input:0" instead of "input".
With the version 1.4.1 of tensorflow, I didn't have this issue.
To reproduce, follow the instructions below, and take a look to the /tmp/inception_v1_frozen_optimized.pbtxt graph. And search le node named "input" it is the input placeholder. Then search node which has an input named "input:0". This name ("input:0") is node a node of the graph.
