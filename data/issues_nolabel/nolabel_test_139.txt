unable to use nn.moments when the dimension of the axis is None

calling nn.moments with an axis of dimension None produces this error:
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/nn.py", line 536, in moments
    divisor *= x.get_shape()[d].value
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'float' and 'NoneType'

is it possible for the nn.moments implementation to use the inferred dimension in it's calculation?
