Test the TensorFlow installation location using inspect

While testing an installation I executed python -c 'import site; print("\n".join(site.getsitepackages()))' from within a virtualenv environment. This raised the same error mentioned in #392.
According to pypa/virtualenv#355 this is an issue with their custom site implementation and may not be updated soon.
I updated the command in the documentation to output the directory where TensorFlow is installed using inspect.
import os
import inspect
import tensorflow

print(os.path.dirname(inspect.getfile(tensorflow)))
I hope this is useful.
