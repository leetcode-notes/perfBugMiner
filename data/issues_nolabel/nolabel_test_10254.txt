custom Android op configuration

Why does Android lack support for so many ops (especially quantized/quantization)?
Although some of them get added after a while, this really gets into the way...
I know that the background is to lower the binary size...
But wouldn't it be possible to compile specifically for a given graph definition?
This could be offered in parallel to the current solution and provide even more fine-grained control.
