How to update the variable list for which the optimizer need to train in tensorflow?

How to update the list of variables for the optimizer to train in tensorflow? In other words, if we have the following optimizer:
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate).minimize(cost_scalar, var_list=my_var_list)
I need to update my_var_list for example while fine tuning the network. That is, I am going to remove the variable which I no longer need to train and keep the others. Example, fine tuning the dense layer in a convolutional neural network.
Any help is much appreciated!!
