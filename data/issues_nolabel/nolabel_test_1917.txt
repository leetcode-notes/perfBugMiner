Run time error raised from image.random_contrast

Environment info
Operating System: SUSE 64bit
Tensorflow version: 0.6.0
Steps to reproduce
I am following the CNN tutorial, and encounter the problem:
E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:264] Executor failed to create kernel. Unimplemented: Op AdjustContrast is not available in GraphDef version 5. It has been removed in version 2. Use AdjustContrastv2 instead.
[[Node: adjust_contrast = AdjustContrast[T=DT_FLOAT, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](RandomCrop, random_uniform, adjust_contrast/min_value, adjust_contrast/max_value)]]
And something like this:
UnimplementedError: Op AdjustContrast is not available in GraphDef version 5. It has been removed in version 2. Use AdjustContrastv2 instead.
Thank you in advance.
