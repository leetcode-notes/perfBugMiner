Why remove tolerate_dup_recv from LocaRendezvous.

I did not find a PR for this patch. Maybe this discussion belongs to that particular commit page. If so, I will move it there.
Can somebody explain the rationale behind this patch? Current contrib/verbs uses exactly this flag to transfer tensors. Note it is set true here. Removing it totally breaks verbs. I am asking if this patch is absolutely needed since there is no simple workaround for contrib/verbs without this flag.
