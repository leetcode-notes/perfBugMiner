Add missing TF_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK for MSVC

TF_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK is used in //tensorflow/compiler/xla, but not defined for MSVC.
Other stuff:

Define TF_ATTRIBUTE_ALWAYS_INLINE as __forceinline for MSVC.
Change two instances of COMPILER_MSVC to _MSC_VER and _WIN32 respectively as the first applies to MSVC only while the second one (dllimport/dllexport) applies to all Windows compilers.
