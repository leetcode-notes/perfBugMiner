How to create an op like conv_ops in tensorflow?

Notice that I'm not looking for a tutorial like this.
What I'm trying to do
I'm new to C++ and bazel and I want to make some change on the convolution operation in tensorflow, so I decide that my first step is to create an ops just like it.
What I have done
I copied conv_ops.cc from //tensorflow/core/kernels and change the name of the ops registrated in my new_conv_ops.cc. I also changed some name of the functions in the file to avoid duplication. And here is my BUILD file.

As you can see, I copy the deps attributes of conv_ops from //tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD. Then I use "bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/core/user_ops:new_conv_ops.so" to build the new op.
What my problem is
Then I got this error.

I tried to delete bounds_check and got same error for the next deps. Then I realize that there is some problem for including h files in //tensorflow/core/kernels from //tensorflow/core/user_ops. So how can I perfectely create a new op excatcly like conv_ops?
