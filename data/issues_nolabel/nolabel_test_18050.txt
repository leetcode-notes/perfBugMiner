what is the correct format of python command?

Hi guys,
i am running tensorflow-gpu in windows environment of anaconda. the backslash \ doesnt work in anaconda prompt eg:
python train_model.py \ --training_data=rnn_tutorial_data/training.tfrecord-?????-of-????? \ --eval_data=rnn_tutorial_data/eval.tfrecord-?????-of-????? \ --classes_file=rnn_tutorial_data/training.tfrecord.classes
it works in my ubuntu terminal. i dont want to mess with ubuntu cuz the cuda is 9.1 which doesnt support tensorflow1.6 yet.  what is the correct format command in windows of \ backslash?
Hope to hear your suggestions.
