Update Docker Image

Hey All,
There are a variety of issues I'm running into with the docker image, just basic stuff.

sudo apt-get update
Python3 support
Nano is not installed (vim is the worst)
3a.  I want this so I can easily edit the notebook config for setting passwords.
The jupyter notebook needs to be updated to the latest
Pip updates
Maybe ship with Anaconda as well.

Its just a variety of things that aren't working quite well.  I'm trying to put together a Jupyter Notebook our machine learning meetup group can use and share, and its just a pain in the neck.
I tried to do just a fresh setup from a fresh linux vm, but I was having issues getting Jupyter to actually recognize the TensorFlow install; so now I'm trying the docker image again.  The biggest issue with the docker image in its current state is that after a while the auto-save starts breaking, json formats for posting to save break and then it messes up the encoding of the notebook, which then becomes more or less un-recoverable (without extensive effort).
I beleive (not sure) that updating everything in the supported image would fix at least some of these issues.
