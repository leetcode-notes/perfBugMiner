Make TensorFlow build with wrapper-free MSVC CROSSTOOL

With the latest Bazel release (0.5.2), we can now build C++ code on Windows without the python wrapper scripts! This gives faster and more reliable build, but gcc flags in BUILD file won't be translated.
This change removes gcc flags(mostly warning flags) that will cause an error if passed to cl.exe.
The protobuf change is to get google/protobuf@0b059a3, not sure if there is a requirement to use release version of protobuf.
