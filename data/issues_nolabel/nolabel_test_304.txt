Reduction / Term Rewriting / Optimisation / etc.

Can you add an optimisation layer which will do a global optimisation based on a pre defined set of rules  to ensure that the resulting DAG is the absolute minimised form (based on the set of rewiring rules) to transform the inputs to the the outputs or effects. Based on the domain or know ledge of the input data you can register new rules and also when adding new operation you should be able to add new rules.
Perhaps this can be part of the DSL (#70)
