Windows 64-bit GPU Build Failing

The nightly windows 64-bit GPU build has been failing for over 3 days.
I could reproduce the error on different machines:
https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-win/M=windows-gpu,PY=36/245/consoleText
Maybe the health monitor on the main site could include this build as well? Otherwise breaking errors might not be noticed for some longer time.
