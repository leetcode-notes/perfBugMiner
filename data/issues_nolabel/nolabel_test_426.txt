problem about session.run

Hi guys, I am very new to tensorflow. Now I am implementing a pairwise cnn model. While I got the error:
File "Train.py", line 72, in 
train()
File "Train.py", line 48, in train
feature1,feature2,train_loss,_=sess.run([model.feature1,model.feature2,model.cost,model.train_op],feed)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 345, in run
results = self._do_run(target_list, unique_fetch_targets, feed_dict_string)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 404, in _do_run
target_list)
tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow.StatusNotOK: Not found: FeedInputs: unable to find feed output Placeholder:0
Here in the sess.run function, feed is a dictionary containing input data and corresponding labels. feature1 and feature2 are the output of the same neural networks and finally I would like to compare feature1 and feature2.
Any help are more than welcome. Thanks!
