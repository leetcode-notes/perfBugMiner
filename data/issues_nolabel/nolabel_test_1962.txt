Relevant code:
Unfortunately I can't upload everything, but the code is based on your CIFAR-10 example. Here is the structure of my network:

After running for some time, I save a checkpoint:
saver.save(sess, checkpoint_path, global_step=step)
Which sometimes allocates all memory on my system and gets killed. I have 8gb RAM and 8gb swap. For the first few checkpoints it seems fine, it allocates 2gb RAM (equal to checkpoint file size), but after some time it locks up my entire system and gets killed automatically.
Didn't have any issues in 0.7.
