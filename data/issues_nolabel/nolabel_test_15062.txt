Bus Error when running a session

System information

Running on an ODROID-XU4
Have I written custom code: No
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu Mate 16.04
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version: 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version: 0.8.0
GCC Version: 5.4.0
Exact command to reproduce:
python3.5
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow')
sess - tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))

Describe the problem
I have built and installed TensorFlow as a pip package onboard an ODROID-XU4 (32-bit ARM), following the steps in this guide: https://hackernoon.com/running-yolo-on-odroid-yolodroid-5a89481ec141
Everything went smoothly, and I was able to install TensorFlow after a lengthy build time. However, when I try to run any session (such as in the basic example above), the program fails with a Bus Error. Running pip3 list shows that Tensorflow is indeed installed, and no errors are thrown when I merely import TensorFlow.
Source code / logs
I traced the bus error by looking into the /var/log/syslog file and found the following lines associated with the error: Dec 2 21:24:21 odroid kernel: [ 3658.433306] Alignment trap: python3.5 (10189) PC=0xac0bac42 Instr=0xf9068a1f Address=0xbe8a7da4 FSR 0x811 Dec 2 21:24:21 odroid kernel: [ 3658.433313] Alignment trap: not handling instruction f9068a1f at [<ac0bac42>] Dec 2 21:24:21 odroid kernel: [ 3658.439021] Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x811) at 0xbe8a7da4
So, it appears to be an alignment issue. I tried to force the kernel to attempt to fix the error instead of simply failing by using the following command: echo 3 > /proc/cpu/alignment
The three is meant to tell the kernel to fix these alignment issues. However, this strategy has not changed anything about the Bus Error when attempting to run a session.
Perhaps this is related to the 32-bit architecture I am attempting to run on?
