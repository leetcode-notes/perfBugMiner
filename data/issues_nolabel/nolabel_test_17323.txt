Describe the problem
I followed this tutorial from the source code of TF: model/tutorials/image/cifar10/, in the tutorial, you used tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() to log the checkpoint or tensor for future usage with TensorBoard, my question is to display the activation maps of my convnet during training process. But inside the:
while not mon_sess.should_stop(): mon_sess.run(train_op)
I can not add new tensor because the Graph is finalized. So I want to ask you how to add something like tf.summary.image: Pass one example image to a specific convnet  after relu, and save it as png for all the filters???
I think I can easily implement this in a normal tf.Session(), but I am still interested if we can do it in tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession().
I think that would be great for the newbie to understand what happened for our CNN.
Thanks in advance
