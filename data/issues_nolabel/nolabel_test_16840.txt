Point Tensorflow To My Local Protobuf Installation

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): sorta
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1
Python version: 2.7 and 3.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8 and 6
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080
Exact command to reproduce: make
-PROTOBUF VERSION: 3.4.1

Folks, I am using tensorflow C++, and I added it's path to my CMakeLists.txt.
Everything was working fine, but I had to change the protobuf installation to a different path because CAFFE needs a different version of protobuf other than 3.4.1
Now, Tensorflow libraries are complaining they cannot find common.h from protobuf:
/usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.pb.h:9:42: fatal error: google/protobuf/stubs/common.h: No such file or directory
I installed protobuf 3.4.1 here:
/usr/local/include/google
How do I make Tensorflow realize that protobuf is installed in a different path path?
