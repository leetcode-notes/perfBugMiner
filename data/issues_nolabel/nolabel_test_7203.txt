Noticable lag with different Inception model

Running the demo app on Android works absolutelly great. Then I tried retraining the inception5h model (as used by the app) with no success. I retrained Inception v3 model but then image recognition would lag. I tried quantizating the model but it lagged even more. So what I'm asking is for a direction or help on the issue or a retrainable Inception5h model with some instructions.
