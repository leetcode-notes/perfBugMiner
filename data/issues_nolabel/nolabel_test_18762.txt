-x "${GEN_LIBS_DIR}" \
-s "${TF_ROOT_DIR}/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/sub_makefiles/hexagon_graph_execution/Makefile.in" \
-t hexagon_graph_execution

I am working to create tensorflow using DSP hexagon .
I integrated into my  android application after success compilation libtensorflow-core.a library.
But on TF_NewGraph() I have crash:
output logcat:
**graph.cc:283 Non-OK-status: status status: Not found: Op type not registered 'NoOp' in binary running on localhost. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process**.
Please advise how to resolve it
