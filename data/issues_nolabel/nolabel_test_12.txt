Remote worker configuration

Does this release support remote workers out of the box?  I couldn't find details in the tutorials, but the whitepaper and tensorflow/core/common_runtime/device.h talked about adding remote devices through RPC.  Is a parameter server or alternative already implemented in here somewhere?  If remote workers are supported out of the box, what is the execution model?  Is there a daemon or do you have to configure a session in a certain way to act as one?
