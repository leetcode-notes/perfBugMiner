Parallelize bottleneck creation in retraining script

Hi
It might be possible to parallelize the creation of the bottleneck files in the Inception retraining script. Currently it can only do a few images per second and if you have 100s of thousands of images, it takes forever. I could do it myself also and create a pull request, if that's fine.
Thanks
