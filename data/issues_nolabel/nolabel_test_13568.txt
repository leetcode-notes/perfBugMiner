batch_flatten gives unpredictable results when batch_size is 1

Problem
When I attempt to use tf.contrib.keras.backend.batch_flatten or more readily keras.backend.batch_flatten on a Tensor of shape (1, a, b) it produces a Tensor with shape (None, None).
MCVE
Note, I'll use keras tensorflow backend because that is how I noticed it.
t = K.zeros((1,2,2))
print(K.int_shape(K.reshape(t,(-1,2*2))))
print(K.int_shape(K.batch_flatten(t)))

prints out (1,4) and (None, None).
If you replace the first dimension to 2 or more it works as expected.
