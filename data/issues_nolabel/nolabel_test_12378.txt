ssd_mobilenets model faild using in android demo

I am glad to see android demo is updated to be available for ssd_mobilenets models. I tried the demo on my phone, and it works well. But when I tried my own model, the app can not work normally.
1.I used  export_inference_graph.py in object_detection to convert .ckpt to .pb files
2.I replaced the original model by my .pb file
3. Also, I changed the label_list.txt.
After doing this, I generate the app, but the app crushed. Is there anything wrong with my handle?
