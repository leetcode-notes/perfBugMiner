Thread limits are not respected in latest tf-nightly build.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes. My minimal example is as follows:

import tensorflow as tf

config = tf.ConfigProto(
    inter_op_parallelism_threads=1,
    intra_op_parallelism_threads=1,
)

with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
  a = tf.random_uniform((25000, 25000))

  a_sq = tf.matmul(a, a)
  a_sq.eval()


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Goobuntu desktop.
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
tf-nightly (see below)
Python version:
3.5.3

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
When I run the minimal example provided above with tf-nightly==1.8.0.dev20180404, everything works correctly. It saturates one CPU core and leaves the rest unused. However, when run with tf-nightly==1.8.0.dev20180405 TensorFlow consumes all 8 cores.
