Feature request: tf.layers.Layer.{trainable_variables,updates,...} should return values from all sublayers

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.12.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.1
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Titan Xp (12 GB)

Describe the problem
The properties trainable_variables, updates, and so on of tf.layers.Layer currently only returns the corresponding objects from the layer itself. This is different from Keras where it adds the corresponding objects from all child layers.
Please consider to make the behaviour of tf.layers.Layer the same as Keras. In it's current form, these properties are not really helpful.
