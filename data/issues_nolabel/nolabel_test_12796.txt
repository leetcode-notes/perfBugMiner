About Cyclic Graph?

Here is the code that confuses me:
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.Variable(0)
update_a = tf.assign(a, a * 2 + 1)
update_b = tf.assign(a, a * 3 + 3)

s = tf.Session()
s.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

_, _, x = s.run([update_b, update_a, a])
print(x)

It outputs different results (1, 3, 6 and 7, 7 is the most) at different runs.
I think it is caused by the cyclic graph. I don't know if tf has the constriction that the above graph is not allowed. But I have another more common example:
a = convnet_with_bn(img_a)
b = convnet_with_bn(img_b)
when the convnet is share, the bn' moving average operations is like the above code.
Can anybody tells me how I can deal with the above problem?
