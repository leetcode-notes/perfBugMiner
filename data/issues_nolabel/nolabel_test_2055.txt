libpthread.so was not created => can't build Android example

I don't know if it is a tensorflow bug, a bazel bug or a misconfiguration on my side (maybe with SDK/NDK) but could you guys just have a short look at my stackoverflow issue: http://stackoverflow.com/q/36731061/828184
Here the errors (also can be seen on stackoverflow):

ERROR: /home/administrator/TensorFlow_Git/tensorflow/examples/android/BUILD:41:1: output 'tensorflow/examples/android/libpthread.so' was not created.
ERROR: /home/administrator/TensorFlow_Git/tensorflow/examples/android/BUILD:41:1: not all outputs were created.

Sorry for cross-posting but I waited a while, would really need this and don't even know if stackoverflow is the right address at this point.
