Potential Contribution: Ansible roles & playbooks

I've been running tensorflow on ec2 spot instances rather than buying a GPU, and I've written a few ansible playbooks to make this easier given spot instances go down, etc.
I split the base software out into two separate Ansible roles, one for CUDA/cuDNN: (For those unfamiliar with Ansible, the meat is in blob/master/tasks/main.yml)
https://github.com/kuza55/ansible-cudnn
And one for Bazel/TensorFlow:
https://github.com/kuza55/ansible-tensorflow
I've also got a playbook for baking an ec2 AMI from these, and for setting up more AWS-specific things, which I'll open source after I figure out how they should be structured that isn't super specific to all of my ec2 settings.
One thing I haven't done, but may be of interest, is to put together a playbook for setting up a tensorflow cluster and then doing some distributed training.
Let me know if there is any interest in accepting these and linking to them from somewhere (it takes people a while to realize there's a lot of good stuff in the contrib directory).
I'll probably try and submit these to Ansible Galaxy in the hopes people can find it more easily in either case.
