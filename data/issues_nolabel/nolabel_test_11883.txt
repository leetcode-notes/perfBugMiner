Error while building android project from tensorflow/examples

Error:/Users/sagarsuri/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:194:1 Failed to get cached inputs: Could not determine containing package for external/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.h.
I am getting the above error while building Android project which is provided in the examples folder.
I executed this command to pull tensorflow project to my mac:
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git --depth 1
