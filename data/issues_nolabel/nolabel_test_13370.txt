Describe the problem
I am attempting to vary my labels for the summary conditional on some tf.bool data type.  I get an error when I attempt to use the tf.cond.
Per: tensorflow/tensor2tensor#159,
this problem should have been fixed in version 1.1.0
"lukaszkaiser:
This was due to summaries not working with tf.conds right. Should be corrected in 1.1.0, please take a look and reopen if you see this again!"
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
text2 = tf.cast('blah', tf.string)
text_summary = tf.summary.text("NULL", text2) #works fine without conditional
rightness = tf.cast(True, tf.bool)
text_summary = tf.cond( rightness, lambda: tf.summary.text("TRUE", text2), lambda: tf.summary.text("FALSE", text2) ) #breaks with error below
