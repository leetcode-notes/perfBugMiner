eigen_spatial_convolutions.h: reading of uninitialized variable 'k'

It appears that k is not initialized before being read below. From eigen_spatial_convolutions.h:848:
       for (Index k; k < depth; k++) {
          block[0] = dm0.loadCoeffStandard(k);
          block[1] = dm1.loadCoeffStandard(k);
          block[2] = dm2.loadCoeffStandard(k);
          block[3] = dm3.loadCoeffStandard(k);
          block += 4;
        }
      } else {
        for (Index k; k < depth; k++) {
          block[0] = dm0(k);
...

Am I missing something here?
