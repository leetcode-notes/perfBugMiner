Including batch_norm as the normalizer function by default, as mentioned in function description

Changed the description error that includes batch_norm_params, which no longer exists, to normalizer_fn. normalizer_fn = None is changed to normalizer_fn = batch_norm by default, following what the original description says the function will do.
