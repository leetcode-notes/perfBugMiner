Keyword Extraction from a text followed by a key value using tensorflow

Hi
I have a pdf file that contains information. I would like to extract few key terms/phrase along with a value for example (current balance : CHF (swiss francs) 1,000)
I can convert pdf file to text using pdfminer . But how i can extract the above keyword using tensorflow text classification or other methods. I don't want to use rake, TF-IDF.
Can anyone suggest how i can start with it? I haven't came across a single example with tensorflow. There is a question on stack overflow. but this doesn't help me much as I am a beginner.
