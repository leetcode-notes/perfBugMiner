Missing @grpc//third_party/address_sorting

I think a regression was introduced recently when doing a new cpu build:
failed; build aborted: no such package '@grpc//third_party/address_sorting': java.io.IOException: Error downloading [https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/grpc/grpc/archive/bd6bdf93279a39a8cd92978fd7c9d14eccd98fc2.tar.gz, https://github.com/grpc/grpc/archive/bd6bdf93279a39a8cd92978fd7c9d14eccd98fc2.tar.gz]
Reverting this commit allowed the build to continue.
Update:  building origin/master
