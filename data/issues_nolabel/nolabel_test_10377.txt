tf.contrib.data.Dataset fails to batch elements that are tuples

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-rc0-312-g0b72359', '1.2.0-rc0')
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0

Issue
With the new tf.contrib.data.Dataset API, it seems not possible to batch the outputs of a Dataset instance whose elements are tuples.  Code demonstrating problem:
ds = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.range(100).map(lambda x: (x, 2*x))
batched_ds = ds.batch(4)
batched_iter = batched_ds.make_one_shot_iterator()
nxt = batched_iter.get_next()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    val = sess.run(nxt)
    print(type(val))  # => <type 'tuple'>
    print(len(val))  # => 2

It seems that sess.run(nxt) should provide an object having 4 elements.
