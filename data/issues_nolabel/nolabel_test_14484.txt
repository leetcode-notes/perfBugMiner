My trained checkpoint doesn't work.

$ python3 tests/test_snapshot.py lsp out/lsp_alexnet_imagenet_small/checkpoint-370000.data-00000-of-00001

But it shows this error
Data loss: not an sstable (bad magic number): perhaps your file is in a different file format and you need to use a different restore operator? Traceback (most recent call last):
DataLossError (see above for traceback): Unable to open table file out/lsp_alexnet_imagenet_small/checkpoint-370000.data-00000-of-00001: Data loss: not an sstable (bad magic number): perhaps your file is in a different file format and you need to use a different restore operator?
