Starting on a tf.contrib.learn notebook

I'd like to add an IPython notebook using tf.contrib.learn.
I've started on this one. Content is similar to the MNIST For ML Beginners tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html
Can continue fleshing it out down the road, and open to suggestions on how to improve.
