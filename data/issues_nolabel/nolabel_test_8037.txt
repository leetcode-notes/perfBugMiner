How to compile tensorflow using SSE4.1, SSE4.2, and AVX.

Just got tensorflow running. Now running into this error.
Currently using Mac Yosemite, downloaded tensorflow using pip3 through anaconda, using python 3.5.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
So since anaconda has a special set of commands, how do you get tensorflow to run on SSE4.1, SSE4.2, and AVX via the anaconda command system ?  I am really confused how to go about this.
