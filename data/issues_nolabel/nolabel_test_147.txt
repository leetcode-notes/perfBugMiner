add multiple-machine support

Many projects require more resources than are available in a single machine. Does the current opensource release of Tensorflow support processing that spans multiple-machines?
I ask because the main webpage (says single machine) seems to conflict[1] with the Tensorflow whitepaper pdf (says multiple machines).
If the current opensource tensorflow does not support multiple-machine execution but the closed-sourced version does. Is there any plan to release an opensource version that supports multiple machines? Is there an approximate timeframe?

The tensorflow.org main webpage says "This open source release supports single machines". Also the Resources/FAQ says "single computer".
But then when you read the Tensorflow whitepaper, the whitepaper indicates in many places that Tensorflow can run across multiple machines. See these quotes from the whitepaper:

"large-scale  distributed  systems  of  hundreds of machines" and "using
many  hundreds  of  machines"
" extends  it with  support  for  an environment where the client, the master, and the workers can all be in different processes on different machines"
"use remote communication mechanisms such as TCP or RDMA to move data across machine boundaries"
