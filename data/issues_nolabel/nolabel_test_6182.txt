SummaryWriter.add_summary() gives error AttributeError: 'FileWriter' object has no attribute 'add_sumary'

I literally copied and pasted an example from the tensor board training site and it doesn't run.
summary, _ = sess.run([merged, train_step], feed_dict=feed_dict(True)) train_writer.add_summary(summary, i)
Both these lines give an error.
apparently sess.run returns a None type.
