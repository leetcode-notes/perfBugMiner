Tensorflow r0.8 doesn't work with scikit-learn and scikit-Image

I tried two installation method. Without scikit-Learn and scikit-Image, tensorflow works fine and I can run the deepdream ipynb.

cuda 7.5 + cudnn v5 with source code compiled
cuda 7.5 + cudnn v4 pip GPU install

All according to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html
After I installed scikit-learn, the segmentation fault (core dumped) following the Tensorflow loading message even though I import numpy before tesorflow. I will post more info here later.
