Feature request: Docker image build (parameterized_docker_build.sh) lacks option for AVX2 optimization

As far as I can understand there is no way to tell the script parameterized_docker_build.sh  to build an AVX2 optimized docker image.
I see a note about Python 2 and 3 but nothing about AVX2:
# TODO(cais): Add support for TF_DOCKER_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION (PYTHON2/PYTHON3)
