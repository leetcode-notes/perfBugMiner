New feature: Total Variation (image_ops)

This is a pull-request for the new feature discussed in #6397
I have made a short Python Notebook for testing this:

I can add a unit-test when the API / semantics have been agreed upon. I suppose I have to build TensorFlow locally in order to run a unit-test? Have you made a guide for doing this? I have some horrible experiences trying to build other open-source projects in the past.

PS: You may want to have your legal department go over the CLA agreement. It is legalistic gibberish and I had to read parts of it several times to sort-of understand it. Example: "For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity."
