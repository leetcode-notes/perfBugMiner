1.8r Cherrypick request-cherrypicks_30740: Fix for dropped metrics in evaluate function for Keras models.

This CL should be cherrypicked since it fixes the following:

Fixes metric name to metric value dictionary creation with the right 1:1 mapping.
The evaluate function dropped metrics since metric names were not set in compile or during evaluate.
