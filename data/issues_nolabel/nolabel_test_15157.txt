Feature: GANEstimator allow passing of namedtuples

In the current GANEstimator implementation in train.py gan_model(..) both real_data as well as generator_inputs is converted to tensors with either _convert_tensor_or_l_or_d or ops.convert_to_tensor. This prevents the user from using own data structures like namedtuples to pass information between the generator and discriminator.
In the current implementation when passing a namedtuple the result will be a list with all name information being lost.
I propose to either extend the tensor conversion to exclude namedtuples from them or to remove them entirely.
@joel-shor Do you think that is a good idea? I am currently passing logits as well as sample_id from a dynamic_decoding around and I would like to keep the meaning of these across loss_fn and discriminator_fn.

I could remove the conversions entirely. This would introduce breaking changes.
I could exclude namedtuples from the conversion.
Idk yet??

I would create a PR for any of them if we find a suitable solution.
