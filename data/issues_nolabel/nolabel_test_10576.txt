Describe the problem
While running training on a six layer CNN on 2 GPUs, the training starts fine, but after about 450 iterations, the OOM error comes up. During the whole time, the input size remains the same [2, 221, 221, 3] . I am unable to find any anomaly in the tensorboard or in my data.  Complete output and error log below
