batch_matmul doesn't work on GPUs

It seems not possible to register the batch_matmul operation to a GPU device. For example this fails:
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    a = tf.constant(npr.rand(10, 5, 5).astype('float32'))
    b = tf.constant(npr.rand(10, 5, 5).astype('float32'))
    c = tf.batch_matmul(a, b)

sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=False))
sess.run(c)

This is a fundamental operation and so GPU support is rather important. I'm getting the error on Ubuntu 14.04 with CUDA 7.0.
