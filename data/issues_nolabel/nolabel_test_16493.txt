Keras "Output missing from loss dictionary"

I think that this warning can be rephrased:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/engine/training.py#L640-L641
Some outputs could be consumed as TB summary and not involved in any loss.
Especially when you use an estimator converted from a tf.keras model  you have not the explicit control of the model_fn for placing summaries.
So I suppose that one of the entry point for connecting summaries to the graph is the tf.train.SessionRunHook.
I.e. you can produce the output from the Dataset api, consume it as TB summary in the SessionRunHook without using it in any loss.
