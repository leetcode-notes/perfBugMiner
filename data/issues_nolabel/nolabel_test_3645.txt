TensorShape dimensions size should be of type uint64, not int64

According to core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:171:
void TensorShape::AddDim(int64 size) {
    CHECK_GE(size, 0);
TensorShape dimensions size can only be greater or equal to 0. Thus, its type should be uint64_t.
I even wonder if size_t would not be more appropriate.
