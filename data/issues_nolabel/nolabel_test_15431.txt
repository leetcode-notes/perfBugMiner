Add shape function SingleImageRandomDotStereograms

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #15429 where there is no shape function for SingleImageRandomDotStereograms.
This fix adds the shape function for SingleImageRandomDotStereograms.
NOTE: SingleImageRandomDotStereograms takes an attribute of output_image_shape which is in the format of [X, Y, C] ([ImageX, ImageY, Channel]. However, the actual
data output is in the format of [ImageY, ImageX, Channel] ([h, w, c]). So by default the output_image_shape has the value of [1024, 768, 1] but the output data will be [768, 1024, 1].
And if [1200, 800, 1] is used explicitly then the output data shape will be [800, 1200, 1].
This fix does not change the behavior for now.
This fix fixes #15429.
