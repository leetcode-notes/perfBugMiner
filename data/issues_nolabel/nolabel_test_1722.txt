The nightly gpu builds for python 3 are failing consistently

The nightly gpu builds for python 3 are failing some tests consistently.
In the most recent console output log, the following 4 tests seem to fail: (each item links to the relevant test output log)

(66 / 224) Python test-on-install FAILED (): tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/bias_op_test.py
(75 / 224) Python test-on-install FAILED (): tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/conv_ops_test.py
(93 / 224) Python test-on-install FAILED (): tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/fft_ops_test.py
(120 / 224) Python test-on-install FAILED (): tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/pooling_ops_test.py

(Also: The link in the readme file to the nightly gpu builds for python 3 seems to pointing to some old build that hasn't been updated for a week?)
