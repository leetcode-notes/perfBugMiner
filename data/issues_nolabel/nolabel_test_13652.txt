No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Assign' running nightlypi stable build on raspberry pi 3

I am running the tensorflow backend to keras on a raspberry pi 3 with the lastest Stretch
The tensorflow 1.3 build is http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-pi/lastStableBuild/
When running the Adam optimizer I'm seeing the following error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Assign' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
device='CPU'; T in [DT_FLOAT]
device='CPU'; T in [DT_INT32]
     [[Node: Adam_2/iterations/Assign = Assign[T=DT_INT64, _class=["loc:@Adam_2/iterations"], use_locking=true, validate_shape=true](Adam_2/iterations, Adam_2/iterations/initial_value)]]

What can I do to solve this?
