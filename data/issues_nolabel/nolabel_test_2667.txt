How to save and restore tensorflow graph and it's state in C++?

I'm training my model using tensorflow in C++ (I have a lot of stuff in c++ for my model). Python is used only for constructing the graph. So is there way to save and restore graph and its state purely in C++? I know about python tf.train.Saver but as I've understood it is not exists in C++.
Is it possible to get GraphDef from already running session?
