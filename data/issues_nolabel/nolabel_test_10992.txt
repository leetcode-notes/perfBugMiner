Feature request: RNN BeamSearchDecoder with Mixture Density Networks For Continuous Truth Values

For continuous data, there are 3 options to run a beam search when decoding:

This is a workaround. Quantize continuous truth values into into either one-hot vector or embedding, effectively transforming the regression into a classification problem.
Use a mixture density model with N Gaussian mixtures. When decoding, sample top beam_width mixtures.
Use the SOTA method described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01474.pdf

Of course, the preferred method is number 3.
With a graph similar to #10736, how can such a decoder be implemented?
My suggestion is to create a separate decoder subclass that specifically handle this situtation to avoid confusion.
