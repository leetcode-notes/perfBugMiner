Error when trying to run tensorboard --logdir=some_path

Hi,
I am using python 2.7 on Mac 10.11.4.
I get errors when I am trying to run tensorboard --logdir=path
where path is some path I have specified, i.e. 'visualizations'
It correctly creates the directory visualizations in my current working directory, but
if I run: tensorboard --logdir=path, I get:
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
If I try: tensorboard --logdir=visualizations, I get:
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
If I try: tensorboard --logdir=/visualizations/, I get:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Please help me! And I would really appreciate an explanation for this, as I am relatively new to all this.
Thanks a lot in advance!
