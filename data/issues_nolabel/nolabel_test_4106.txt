Feature request: ability to sample from seq2seq decoder given input

Given some particular encoder input, it would be great to be able to sample sequences from the embedding_tied_rnn_seq2seq decoder. To my understanding, at present, this is possible with the tied_rnn_seqw2seq decoder, by passing in a custom loop_function, but it isn't possible in the embedding version. It appears that only argmax is supported with the feed_previous parameter. This would be useful in dialog/conversation applications, and perhaps others.
