Getting sparse tensors from graph by name

Standard (dense) tensors can be easily retrieved by name from a graph using:
graph.get_tensor_by_name("tensor_name:tensor_index")
Comparable functionality is provided for operations, but it's not clear to me how to retrieve a sparse tensor in a similar way.
Is such functionality provided at the moment? Having to pass the object around makes the code more involved than it should be.
