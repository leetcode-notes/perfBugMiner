An easy problem about tensorflow tf.reduce_mean op

I know... there might not be a suitable palce to ask this question, but I really hope someone cloud help me.
i want to use the "tf.reduce_mean" to obtain the mean of an array (ignore the zeros element)
eg:
data = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[0,0,0]]
i want to obtain mean= [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
but  tf.reduce_mean op gets the mean=[1.6, 2.3, 3]
Thank you very much!
