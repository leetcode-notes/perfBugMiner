Add int8 support to div operations

I ran into issues when performing division operations using tf.int8 datatypes, getting errors like:
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'FloorDiv' with these attrs.
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'TruncateDiv' with these attrs.
This PR registers int8 as a datatype for these division ops.
