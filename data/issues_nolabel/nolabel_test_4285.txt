Force clean+fetch when re-running configure with different settings.

Run bazel clean and bazel fetch in the configure script even when building
without GPU support to force clean+fetch if the user re-runs ./configure
with a different setting.
Print a more actionable error messsage if the user attempts to build with
--config=cuda but did not configure TensorFlow to build with GPU support.
Update the BUILD file in @local_config_cuda to use repository-local labels.

Fixes #4105
