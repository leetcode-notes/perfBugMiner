No module named tensorboard in the last pull and build 0.7

I just pulled the repo and build it from source and when calling tensorboard in the terminal I get following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/tensorflow/bin/tensorboard", line 7, in <module>
    from tensorflow.tensorboard.backend.tensorboard import main
ImportError: No module named tensorboard
Env is Mac OS X El Capitan.
