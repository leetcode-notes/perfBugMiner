make "smart_cond" api public and reusable

Fix #13903
Move the implementation of "smart_cond" and "constant_value" from tensorflow/python/layers/utils to tensorflow/python/ops/control_flow_ops and add corresponding test and expose smart_cond to tensorflow/python/ops/standard_ops.
@martinwicke should I implement the API in this way or not? As I think ops should be lower level API than layers and smart_cond should be a kind of ops. It's my first time to contribute to TensorFlow. Please feel free to correct me if there's any problem with the design and codes.
Tips, I closed the former PR #13938 and create a new since there's some signature/info problem with that PR.
