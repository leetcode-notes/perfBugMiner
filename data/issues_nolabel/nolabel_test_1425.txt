Add complex128 dtype

I've started implementing support for complex128 in order to fix #1420.
This commit contains all changes necessary to create and run complex128 variables.
If this is okay so far, I'll add tests, change the documentation and enable complex128 for all ops that are already using complex64 (and add the corresponding tests).
The only change I wasn't sure about is whether it was okay to rename the TF_COMPLEX enum entry to TF_COMPLEX64 at 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/public/tensor_c_api.h
    
    
         Line 81
      in
      97f585d
    
    
    
    

        
          
           TF_COMPLEX = 8,  // Single-precision complex 
        
    
  

, as this is not backwards-compatible with external source code that uses the C API.
Should I change the entry back to TF_COMPLEX?
