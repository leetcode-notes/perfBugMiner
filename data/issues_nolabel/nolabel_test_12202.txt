Using keras built-in models

Version
v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d
Problem
The Keras built-in models in tf.contrib.keras.applications.* cannot be used as a subgraph in TF.
Example

Cause
Calling keras.applications.InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')(input_tensor) is supposed to load pre-trained weights only for related variables, but it initializes the entire TF graph.
