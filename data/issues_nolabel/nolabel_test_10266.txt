QuantizedConv2D (inference) on iOS

Hello,
I had some question and it would be nice to get quick help/reply.
I know, that accelerate framework (cblass_sgemm) is used for Conv operation (gemm_functors.h) incase of iOS platform. However, that is for float datatype.

What happens incase of quantized op of inception5h graph. For example, which library is used for QuantizedConv2D operation incase of iOS mobile platform?
Is Accelerate framework is used also for QuantizedConv2D operation? If so, then is the comptuation actually happens for float datatype and not 8bit mult and 32bit accumulation?

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
