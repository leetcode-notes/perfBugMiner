Fix out of memory issue on Tegra devices

TF used to allocate (available memory - 300MB) or (available memory - 225MB)
for TF to use. This is fine for graphic cards, but will cause out of memory
issue on Tegra.
Modify to allocate (available memory - 1GB) for Tegra.
1GB should be enough for OS and other apps
(available memory - 1GB) should be 0.8-1.5GB which is enough for most graph for TF.
