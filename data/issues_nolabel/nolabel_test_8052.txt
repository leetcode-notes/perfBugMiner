install_linux.md: add missing closing <tt> tag

There is a simple formatting error in install_linux.md which leads to the lower section of https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#run_a_short_tensorflow_program  being rendered entirely in monospaced font. Add a closing <tt> tag to correct formatting.
