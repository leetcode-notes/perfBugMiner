Add int64 input tensor support for `tf.invert_permutation`

This fix tries to add int64 input tensor support for tf.invert_permutation.
In the docs of the TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/invert_permutation), it was specified that the input tensor x could be either int32 or int64:
x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 1-D.

However, int64 was actually not supported.
This fix adds the int64 support by adding template to the class InvertPermutationOp so that both int64 and int32 could be processed.
This fix also adds additional test cases so that changes could be covered.
