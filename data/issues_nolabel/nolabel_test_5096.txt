Cannot run  "bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain"

Hi,
I've been having issues in building the image retraining example. When I run bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain I get the following error:
ERROR: $TF_HOME/tensorflow/core/BUILD:991:1: Executing genrule //tensorflow/core:version_info_gen failed: bash failed: error executing command /bin/bash -c 'source external/bazel_tools/tools/genrule/genrule-setup.sh; tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py --generate  "bazel-out/host/genfiles/tensorflow/core/util/version_info.cc"': com.google.devtools.build.lib.shell.BadExitStatusException: Process exited with status 1.
Traceback (most recent call last):

The file gen_git_source.py exists but the file "bazel-out/host/genfiles/tensorflow/core/util/version_info.cc" does not seem to exist.
Could this be happening because the generate() method inside gen_git_source expects multiple arguments which are not being provided?
Environment info
Debian 4.6.4-1
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
If I comment out the line 991 in core/BUILD, that doesn't help either. It gives an array of other errors.
I found another related error: #4701
