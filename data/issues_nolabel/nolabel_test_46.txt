Missing "pip install --upgrade pip" in instructions leads to bogus error "No such file or directory ... setup.py"

I set up a virtualenv and ran ./bin/activate then tried the install command:
(tensorflow) $ ./bin/pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl
Downloading/unpacking https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl

(tensorflow) $

As shown in the session, there is no /var/folders/gQ/gQ784XlzFBu-AAhgOvz4Ek+++TI/-Tmp-/pip-emt5Bl-build/setup.py, but there is a /var/folders/gQ/gQ784XlzFBu-AAhgOvz4Ek+++TI/-Tmp-/pip-emt5Bl-build/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py
So I suspect pip is failing to interpolate the subdirectory tensorflow/tools/pip_package into the path when trying to launch setup.py.
Here is another report of the same problem on Linux (the question asker is trying to install tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl  , and a comment was added by a user who has Ubuntu 12.04)
