Fix a minor tuple plus operation

This PR is to fix a minor bracket format for tuple plus operation.
As we can see _conv definition, the input arg "filter_size" is an int tuple.

#Now the computation.
kernel = vs.get_variable(
"kernel", filter_size + (total_arg_size_depth, num_features), dtype=dtype)

Thus this PR is to fix above "[]" with "()" since plus operation should be on same data type tuple instead of list.
