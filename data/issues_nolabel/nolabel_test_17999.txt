Problem installing demo app on Android Studio because of Bazel

Hi I am trying to build the demo project on my linux pc and am getting this error. I opened the project after from the examples folder from the tensor flow library.
ERROR: /home/riya/.cache/bazel/_bazel_riya/e4d251743a4c03f32e2f3f7357bd97d7/external/bazel_tools/tools/android/BUILD:288:1: Executing genrule @bazel_tools//tools/android:no_android_sdk_repository_error failed (Exit 1)

In my Android project I am getting the same error as this :
Error:Execution failed for task ':buildNativeBazel'.
