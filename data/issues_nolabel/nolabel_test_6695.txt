Cherry Pick bundle_shim to 0.12.x branch

bundle_shim.py was added to "allows a system to load both legacy session bundle and SavedModel bundle." however this is only on master. This leads to issues saving and then loading back models, for example see: #6336.
I suggest cherry picking it to current release branch.
