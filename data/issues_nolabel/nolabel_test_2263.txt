Add complex128 support

Added the complex128 support, based on the guidance from @girving and others in PR #2244. All tests (in CPU) including backwards_compatibility_test are passed! I couldn't test the GPU version.
The complex128 support is not added for FFT ops with input: complex64 and output: complex64.
