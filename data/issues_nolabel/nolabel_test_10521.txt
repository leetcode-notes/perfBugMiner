Windows: conv_grad_ops_3d.cc and conv_ops_3d.cc take a long time to compile

From http://ci.tensorflow.org/job/tf-master-win-bzl/1073/console, I see:
00:54:33 [3,344 / 3,367] Compiling tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_ops_3d.cc; 906s standalone ... (2 actions running)
00:58:07 [3,344 / 3,367] Compiling tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_ops_3d.cc; 1121s standalone ... (2 actions running)

01:12:26 [3,345 / 3,367] Compiling tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops_3d.cc; 1978s standalone

As you can see, it takes about half an hour to compile these two files.
This has been a bottleneck of the TF Windows Bazel build time for a while.
I guess it's because we are compiling with /O2 option, so compiler was spending too much time on optimizing. But is there anything we can do to optimize the build time?
