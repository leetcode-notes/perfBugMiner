Fix absl flag initialization in cloud_tpu_profiler

This fixes a regression caused by 2652704 where the command would not run. See also: tensorflow/tensorboard#716
This is caused by the PIP generated program wrapper not invoking the tf.app.run that normally goes in the if __main__ clause of a script. That runner basically initializes flags. But as far as I can tell, this is the only pip console script in TensorFlow that still uses flags. The other two appear to have migrated to argparse. So this change should be sufficient.
