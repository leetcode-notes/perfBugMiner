make safe_embedding_lookup_sparse method public and clean duplicate codes

In #17417, I found that same safe_embedding_lookup_sparse code exists in both embedding_ops.py and feature_column.py.
To resolve circular dependency, I create an embedding_ops_py target. The method looks not so good, any suggestion would be appreciated.
