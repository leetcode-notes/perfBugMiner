Tensorflow broken on importing tensorflow.contrib.tensorboard module

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Archlinux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0.61
GPU model and memory: GTX 1070 7.92GiB
Exact command to reproduce:

from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
when I import input_data module from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist, python throws the following errors.And I cannot find the files related to tensorboard under tensorflow/contrib directory.
I dont know if the issue is a tensorboard issue.

And I have installed the tensorboard package.But the problem remains.
Could anyone help me?
