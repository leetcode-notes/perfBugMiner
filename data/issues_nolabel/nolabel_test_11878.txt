SVD-operation on the GPU

This merge request implements the SVD on the GPU using cuSolver.
We are building a sparse Gaussian Mixture Model using Tensorflow and for that we need the SVD and determinant computation (see another merge request). Since these operations were not implemented on the GPU yet and the communication resulted in a large overhead, I implemented them on the GPU.
The SVD is implemented using cuSolver.
cuSolver, however, has the downside of only supporting matrices with m>=n. The CPU-Version of SVD supports also matrices with m<n. So this kernel throws an error when matrices with m<n are passed and notifies the user to explicitly switch to the CPU kernel.
