Unable to find a suitable algorithm for doing forward convolution

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Graphics card: GeForce GTX 750 Ti/PCIe/SSE2
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 7.5, cuNN v5
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*): see cudalib.txt
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
I installed from source -> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
Pulled it today: 04/29/2016
Steps to reproduce

From the tutorial section I copied the partial differential equations example exactly
I started a tensorflow environment: "source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate"
I ran example from the command line: "python pde_example.py"
I get this segmentation fault when I run it on a system using GPUs (details of this are in pde_error.txt) in the loop at:  step.run({eps: 0.03, damping: 0.04})
NOTE: I've run this example on a system not using GPUs and it works splendidly.  Also, I've run other scripts just fine using using the GPUs, it's just this one that doesn't seem to be working.

What have you tried?

I've tried running ./configure with the system default values and putting in them myself, then rebuilding.
Running other scripts using the GPU work fine.
Running this script using a CPU on other machines works fine.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
