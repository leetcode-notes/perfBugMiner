Context in use?

Running the following with GPU support :
python convolutional.py
throws the error:
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:383] Check failed: CUDA_SUCCESS == dynload::cuCtxSetCurrent(context) (0 vs. 216)
Aborted
It seems like 216 when calling cuCtxSetCurrent (which I'm assuming assigns the context to the calling CPU thread) corresponds to CUDA_ERROR_CONTEXT_ALREADY_IN_USE.
What may be causing this error? It seems like the script successfully transfers data to the GPU and fails when initialize_all_variables() is called.
