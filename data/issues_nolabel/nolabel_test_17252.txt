Retrain.py script failing with nan-error at random without any code changes

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Working on a notebook with MacOS High Sierra v10.13.1 in a Docker container using Ubuntu 16.04.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: Using CPU
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

python -m scripts.retrain \
  --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks \
  --summaries_dir=tf_files/training_summaries/ \
  --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
  --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
  --image_dir=/ml/data/images

Describe the problem
My set up is based on the tensorflow-for-poets tutorial. To test if everything is working I use the contained flower dataset. I tried to train the default inceptionV3 as well as the mobilenet architectures. However, training fails at some random point with the below listed error. This error does not seem to appear (or at least not as regular) if I train 500 or less training steps.
Based on what I read here the thrown error is indicating model instability. Since I changed neither code nor data this seems a bit strange. I think it might be a bug but you can probably help me figuring out if this is the case.
