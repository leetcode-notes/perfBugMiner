Add bounds to tf.contrib.opt.ScipyOptimizerInterface

For style transfer it is common the use L-BFGS-B, and the ScipyOptimizerInterface greatly simplifies its application in TF. However, to increase the quality of the synthesised images one typically restricts the range of the values to standard int8 [0, 255] by providing box constraints.
Hence my feature request: Please add the bounds keyword to the interface of ScipyOptimizerInterface.
