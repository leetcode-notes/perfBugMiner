Add bool type supports for GPU kernels

This PR adds bool type supports for GPU kernels (reshape, concat, and stack). The problem is originally described in #11676. Following is a minimum code snippet, which runs on CPU but not on GPU:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
a = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[2, 2])
b = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[2, 2])
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    try:
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            result = tf.reshape(a, [1, 4])
            sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    except Exception as e:
        print('---reshape---\n' + str(e))
    try:
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            result = tf.concat([a, b], 0)
            sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    except Exception as e:
        print('---concat---\n' + str(e))
    try:
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            result = tf.stack([a, b], 1)
            sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    except Exception as e:
        print('---stack---\n' + str(e))
As far as I know, there is no reason not to have boolean supports for these operations. Thus I propose the boolean supports.
