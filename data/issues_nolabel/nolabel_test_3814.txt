Add a build target for a shared library that contains the c api symbols

Since r0.10, the library created by build target tensorflow:libtensorflow.so does not contain the c api symbols anymore (whereas this was the case in previous releases). I imagine that this was caused by the c api moving from tensorflow/core to tensorflow/c. This is a little inconvenient for our ocaml tensorflow bindings as they rely on these symbols.
Would it be possible to add back this dependency ? Something as simple as adding "//tensorflow/c:c_api" to the deps list worked for me.
If this dependency has been avoided on purpose for tensorflow:libtensorflow.so, could we add a different build target, e.g. libtensorflow_c.so, that would include it ?
I'm happy to write a pull request for either of these if this helps.
