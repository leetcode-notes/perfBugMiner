Support to convert CudnnLSTM params to normal Weights and Bias

My environment is Tensorflow r0.11, Linux 16.04, CUDA8.0, cuDNN5.1
I am using the CudnnLSTM class  from tensorflow.contrib.cudnn_rnn , the training speed is really fast with about 5~6x speedup. However after training I need to move the model to an embeded system which is not CUDA based. So how can I convert the CudnnLSTM params to normal weights and bias.
Is this feature still in plan or already have other solutions to this issue ?
