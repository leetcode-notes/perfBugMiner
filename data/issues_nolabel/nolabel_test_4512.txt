If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I'm trying to select the last N-1 element of a 1D tensor with N elements, for the array [0,1,2,3,4] I'm trying to extract [1,2,3,4]
x = tf.convert_to_tensor([0,1,2,3,4])
b = x[:tf.shape(x)[0]-1]
