Can I install TensorFlow on the Pi zero

Hi,
Can I install TensorFlow on the Pi zero.
I tried "sudo pip2 install tensorflow-0.9.0-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl"
but it returned
tensorflow-0.9.0-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Storing debug log for failure in /root/.pip/pip.log
I haven't try from Docker image yet. is it possible ?
or Can I install the C++  code ?
thank you and regards,
Khoa
