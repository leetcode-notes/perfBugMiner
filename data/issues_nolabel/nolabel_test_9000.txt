Allow the output of `tf.argmax` as index type

This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #8951 where the following will raise a TypeError:
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.argmax(a)
tf.Session().run(a[b])

TypeError: Input 'strides' of 'StridedSlice' Op has type int32 that does not match type int64 of argument 'begin'.

The reason for the erorr is that, strides is added  as append(1) without type while begin is appended with type. (See commit diff).
The mismatch of strides and begin causes the error.
This fix fixes the issue by cast the stride with the same type as begin when needed.
This issue was raised in #8951. It was also raised earlier in #206 (comment)
