Some Sampling Ops

issue: #565
This git pull request will give support to doing the sampling trick presented by Bengio et al., 2015 "Scheduled Sampling for Sequence Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks". Originally I was thinking of doing the entire "softmax sampling" in one step (i.e., 1 kernel), but I decided to seperate it. I might submit a "monolithic" op for that later, but i highly doubt theres any major perf diff...
