Adding connectivity check, compilation fix and some code refactoring to verbs

Connectivity check - checking the correctness of the RDMA configuration parameters by pinging on each channel.
Compilation with verbs and without CUDA fix (contrib/verbs only works on GPU #13466)
Code refactoring:
Call done in case of not OK status fix
Replace hardcoded 100 with RDMA_QP_QUEUE_DEPTH
