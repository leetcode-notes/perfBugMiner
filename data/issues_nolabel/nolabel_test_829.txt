GradientDescentOptimizer requires explicit variable listing after being called once in a different session

When I run
debugger.txt, I get a TypeError because the operation gradstep yields an empty list. However, when I comment out the first attempt to gather a gradient, or add the argument var_list=[W,b] to the second attempt, this error does not occur. It seems like somehow there's an issue with identifying the var_list implicitly, after having run (and closed) the previous session.
