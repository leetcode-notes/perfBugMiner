TF Slim - allow soft placement for devices with train_image_classifier

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.12.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below): git tag 1.2
Python version: 2.7 system install
Bazel version (if compiling from source): home-brew 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory:  NA
Exact command to reproduce:

train Mobilenet_v1 on CPU like so:
python train_image_classifier.py     --train_dir=${TRAIN_DIR}     --dataset_dir=${DATASET_DIR}     --dataset_name=Framing     --dataset_split_name=train     --model_name=mobilenet_v1     --checkpoint_path=${CHECKPOINT_PATH}     --checkpoint_exclude_scopes=MobilenetV1/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/biases,MobilenetV1/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/weights
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Tensorflow 1.2 has no GPU support for macOS. Thus training/retraining can only happen on CPU.
TF Slim doesnt appear to have an out of the box way to specify soft placement of nodes - therefore I can't appear to train a mobile net checkpoint?
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
