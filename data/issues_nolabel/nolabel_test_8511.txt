Documentation for serving canned estimators

Hey,
the documentation on how to serve canned estimators with tensorflow serving is somewhat confusing. The docstring for export_savedmodel says to provide a function returning an InputFnOps which isn't documented anywhere. In the source it says it moved to estimator/export.py and InputFnOps was renamed to ServingInputReceiver. However, this does not exist at all. [I might have been confused by multiple checked out versions here, I suppose]
Digging around in the tests for estimator it all is becoming a bit clearer but it would be great if there were more documentation on this topic (also from the serving side as I now have my model exported but cannot get any predictions out of it :( )
Thanks!
Christian
