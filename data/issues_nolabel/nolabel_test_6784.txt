Enhance cuda kernel helper.

Changes on functionality:

Use native atomicAdd for double if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600.
Add max wrappers for float, double and Eigen::half.
Add SetConstant and ReplaceValue kernels. They are useful for example, when doing element-wise max: SetConstant to MIN, do max(), then ReplaceValue MIN with some friendly values, like zeros.

Changes on readability:

SetZero(const int nthreads, T* bottom_diff) to SetZero(const int nthreads, T* data), bottom_diff maybe is from Caffe ;-), and is irrelevant here.
Reorder Add and Max wrappers, to make them better grouped together.
