Feature request: batch image input for exported model (image retraining)

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.1
Python version: 3.6.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.5/6
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
Feature request:
I want to use the image retraining on my own image classes and then use the exported model as part of my data pipeline. But I noticed that the exported model only accepts input tensors of size (1, 299, 299, 3). It would be really great if it could accept batch images for example (32, 299, 299, 3) tensors. If you could advise me on how best to modify the code to do this that would be great too.
Source code / logs
How I trained my model:
python3 tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py --image_dir $DATA_DIR

Here I tried feeding (2, 299, 299, 3) tensor as input to the model
