Better docs of returned tensor in ctc_ops.py

'Logits' aren't a meaningful word for what the ctc_cost function returns. Browsing the implementation (tensorflow/tensorflow/core/util/ctc/) I saw that the cost function is returning the negative log probabilities of the target labelling, so, this new comment erases any doubt. Thanks!
