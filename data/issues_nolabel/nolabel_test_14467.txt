Fix Python auto configure build support

7ccfbdf caused our Python autoconf to no longer be auto. This was likely due to the helper function _get_env_var() which has now been removed. I also used this change as an opportunity to apply DRY and remove some legacy documentation.
This change blocks tensorflow/tensorboard#719
