Bug: tf.estimator.Estimator.export_savedmodel does not work with pathlib.Path in py36

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary

Describe the problem
The function tf.estimator.Estimator.export_savedmodel does not accept a pathlib.Path object, because
tensorflow.python.util.compat.as_bytes used in tensorflow.python.estimator.export.get_timestamped_export_dir can not convert pathlib.Path to bytes.
Here the code snippet from tensorflow.python.estimator.export.get_timestamped_export_dir:
    export_dir = os.path.join(
        compat.as_bytes(export_dir_base),
        compat.as_bytes(str(export_timestamp)))
I would write a PR, but I am not sure how to solve this problem in Python2. The following works in Python3.6 (If I remember correctly it was py36, where os.path start to accept pathlib.Path):
    export_dir = compat.as_bytes(os.path.join(
        export_dir_base,
        str(export_timestamp)))
Since the name tensorflow.python.util.compat.as_bytes does not imply that the input is a path, I am not sure if that would be a better place to solve the problem.
Source code / logs
Here some pseudo code (I hope with this example the tensoflowers are able to reproduce this bug in py36):
from pathlib import Path
tf.estimator.Estimator(...).export_savedmodel(
            Path('path/to/save'),
            export_input_fn,
            as_text=True,
        )
