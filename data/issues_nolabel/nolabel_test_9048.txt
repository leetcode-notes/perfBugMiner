Add documentation about extra update ops to tf.layers.batch_normalization

tf.layers.batch_normalization uses extra ops for updating its moving_mean and moving_variance variables, but these are added to the graph in such a way that they will not be a dependency of the main training op. Instead, they must be run separately, accessed through the tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS collection. This was explained in the documentation for tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm, but this information seems not to have survived the transition to tf.layers.batch_normalization.
Long term, if possible, it would be really nice if we didn't have to do anything extra to get these update operations to work. But in the meantime, here's a patch for the documentation which explains how to make sure the extra ops do get run.
