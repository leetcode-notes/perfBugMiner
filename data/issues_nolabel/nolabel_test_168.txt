tensor flow does not support operator.__truediv__

tensorflow type does not support operation.truediv as in the basic example in https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py
In line 153,  ' normalized_embeddings = embeddings / norm'  will cause the attribute error as followed
"AttributeError: type object 'Tensor' has no attribute 'truediv"
To solve the problem, we can replace this line as 'normalized_embeddings = tf.div(embeddings, norm)'
