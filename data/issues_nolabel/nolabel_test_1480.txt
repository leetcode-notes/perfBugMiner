Renaming of input arguments for clarity

Sorry in advance for being a bit pedantic... I bring this up because of lack of clarity when it comes to gather.
Right now there are many names for a generic input:

to_float and others use x instead of tensor
shape, size, rank, and others use input instead of tensor
reshape and others use tensor
gather uses params instead of tensor
dynamic_partition uses data instead of tensor
pack and unpack use values and value instead of tensor_list and tensor

params suggests that gather is special purpose, perhaps for efficiency or some other reason. Is it? If so, should we update the documentation? If not, can we change the name of params?
In addition, I think value(s) and input should be changed: a Tensor isn't a value and input is a Python built-in.
