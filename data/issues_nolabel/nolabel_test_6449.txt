Using OpenCL on macOS

Thank you very much for developing nice framework. I have a question about OpenCL support for macOS. Is there no way to run tensorflow with GPU on recent MacBookPro?  Tensorflow support OpenCL. But I think this is for Linux, not for macOS. Tensorflow + OpenCL need ComputeCpp. But ComputeCpp compiler do not support macOS(I couldn't find ComputeCpp binary for mac). Do you have a plot to support recent MacBook pro's GPU?
