error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/ops/gen_sparse_ops.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file

After I compiled the source code of TF0.10 (the latest version) using command "bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package", I tried to generate the .whl package using the following command:
"bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg"
However, errors occured:

/tmp/tmp.r1OX0vuucW ~/bxl/tf1.0

error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/ops/gen_sparse_ops.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file
Anyone knows how to solve this? Thx
