Update vulcanized output of TensorBoard to fix health pill errors.

The previous version of TensorBoard in release 1.2 had outputted console errors related to debugger health pills (a currently internal feature). This new vulcanized output fixes that bug in release 1.2 by adding guards.
My text editor also removed some blank characters.
