Makefile build fails on OSX: -lprotobuf not found

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No. Using the provided Makefile build system.


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mac OS X 10.12.6


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source - r 1.3


TensorFlow version (use command below):
r1.3


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Build label: 0.5.2-homebrew


Exact command to reproduce:
sh /tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_linux.sh


Describe the problem
I think there is a bug in the make files when building for OSX. Actually, the build finishes ok but the scripts give a linked error when compiling the provided benchmark program.
The error given is:
ld: library not found for -lprotobuf
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)


Source code / logs
This is the line where error occurs:
gcc --std=c++11 -DIS_SLIM_BUILD -fno-exceptions -DNDEBUG -O3 -march=native -I. -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/ -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/gemmlowp -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/proto/ -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/proto_text/ -Itf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf-host/include -I/usr/local/include \
	-o tf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark tf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/obj/tensorflow/core/util/reporter.o tf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/obj/tensorflow/tools/benchmark/benchmark_model.o tf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/obj/tensorflow/tools/benchmark/benchmark_model_main.o \
	 tf_build/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a -L/usr/local/lib -all_load -lstdc++ -lprotobuf -lz -lm

As you can see towards the end it links against -lprotobuf, however, it does not give the path to the library (It's missing -L/some-path/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf-host/lib). When I manually compile the program, instead of using the makefile, and pass the library path, it works fine.
It is easy to fix by modifying the lines 186 onwards in the Makefile from:
ifeq ($(TARGET),OSX)
	LDFLAGS += -all_load
endif

to
ifeq ($(TARGET),OSX)
	LDFLAGS += -all_load
ifeq ($(HAS_GEN_HOST_PROTOC),true)
	LIBFLAGS += -L$(MAKEFILE_DIR)/gen/protobuf-host/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(MAKEFILE_DIR)/gen/protobuf-host/lib
endif

Another related issue is that I get a whole bunch of warnings from ranlib about some of the built libraries having no symbol. Any comments on that will also be appreciated:
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/ranlib: file: /fullpath/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a(mkl_layout_pass.o) has no symbols

Thanks.
