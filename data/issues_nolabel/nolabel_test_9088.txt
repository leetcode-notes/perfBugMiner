'tensorboard' command not found (raspberry pi 3)

Bug in installation (tensorflow python code runs fine)
here are the step I used to install TensorFlow :
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
wget https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/releases/download/v1.0.1/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl
pip install --user tensorflow-1.0.1-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl
pip uninstall mock
pip install --user mock
sudo pip install --user git+https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn.git

the machine is a raspberrry pi v3 (raspbian v 8.0)
tensorflow v 1.0.1
problem :
I try to run tensorboard, I get a command not found
I tried locate, find, whereis, .... nothing, seems like it did not get installed with tensorflow
logs :
dont know if there are any install logs, if yes let me know where to find them
