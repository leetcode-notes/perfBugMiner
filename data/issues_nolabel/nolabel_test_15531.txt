Fix sample_distorted_bounding_box where min_object_covered could be None

This fix tried to address the issue raised in #15529 where not providing min_object_covered a value will result in a ValueError. In the docstring, however, min_object_covered has been described as default to 0.1.
The reason for the issue is that when sample_distorted_bounding_box switched to V2, min_object_covered has been changed form an attr to an input. As input could not have a default value, min_object_covered=None will result in an error.
This fix adds the check so that a default value 0.1 will be provided if min_object_covered=None.
This fix fixes #15529.
