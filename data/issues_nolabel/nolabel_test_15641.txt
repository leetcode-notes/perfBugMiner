Compile with selective register on meta file

I want to apply the selective registration feature on my model to decrease the lib size. However, I need to apply it on a meta file saved via saver rather than a frozen pb file as shown in many posts I have found. When I try to run
bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header --graphs=model_test.ckpt-390760.meta
it comes to the error
[libprotobuf ERROR external/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/wire_format_lite.cc:621] String field 'tensorflow.NodeDef.op' contains invalid UTF-8 data when parsing a protocol buffer. Use the 'bytes' type if you intend to send raw bytes.
I tried to add --proto_fileformat=textproto but another error comes up:
raise self.ParseError('Expected identifier or number.') google.protobuf.text_format.ParseError: 2:1 : Expected identifier or number.
Is it even possible to do this at all? The ultimate goal of compiling this lib is to restore a pretrained model and incrementally train it on Android.
