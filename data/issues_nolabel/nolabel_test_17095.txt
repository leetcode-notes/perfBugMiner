tensorflow_self_check.py needs updates for CUD 9.0 to look for cudnn64_7.dll

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Win 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip.exe install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below):  b'unknown' '1.5.0'
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660
Exact command to reproduce:tensorflow_self_check.py

Describe the problem
The current tensorflow_self_check.py script needs updates for CUDA 9.0 for use with tensorflow 1.5.0.
I followed the script error messages and suggestions and removed CUDA 9.0 and installed the older CUDA 8.0 and the requisite cudnn64_6.dll. The script told me that I had all the required .dll, but tensorflow was still not working and to go file a bug report.
When I manually did "import tensorflow" and followed the detailed error messages, I realized that tensorflow 1.5.0 really does support CUDA 9.0 and really does want cudnn64_7.dll, see below.
ImportError: Could not find 'cudnn64_7.dll'. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Note that installing cuDNN is a separate step from installing CUDA, and this DLL is often found in a different directory from the CUDA DLLs. You may install the necessary DLL by downloading cuDNN 7 from this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
With CUD 9.0 and cudnn64_7.dll installed, tensorflow 1.5.0 is working, GPU is enabled. The tensorflow_self_check.py needs an update to look for cudnn64_7.dll. Maybe also get rid of code that looks for older dll versions?
