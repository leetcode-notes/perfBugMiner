You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
On machines with AVX512 instruction set, multinomial_op_test fails on CPU device. Most likely this is an issue with Eigen's AVX512 log implementation.
Test passes if I disable the AVX512 plog implementation https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/src/3215c06819b99ce52d5a8d6939d072024e1e3fa0/Eigen/src/Core/arch/AVX512/MathFunctions.h?fileviewer=file-view-default#MathFunctions.h-36:125
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
