Is unpack of TensorFlow deprecated?

I noticed that when I run the following code in v1.0.0 which was working well in v0.11.0 and v0.12.0, it's failed and told me that
 new_shape = [batch_size, new_rows, new_cols, num_filters]
 tf_shape = tf.pack(new_shape)

error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'pack'

And I also can't find that in tf api docs. I  am wondering what API to replace it? I didn't see any deprecated hint in v0.12 api docs
