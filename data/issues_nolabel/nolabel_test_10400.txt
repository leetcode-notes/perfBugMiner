add metric op

This pull request is aimed to create a metric_op for TF-Slim learning to be able to show the streaming metrics(accuracy,...) for the training phase.
The op reset the total and count local variables defined by streaming_metric(if it is streaming_accuracy ,...) per each epoch of training so the accumulative accuracy per epoch can be represented.
