Shape information is not preserved through sampling

When I create a sample from a normal based on the shape of another tensor, that shape information is not retained.
Using Tensorflow 0.7.1:
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, 12))
>>> y = tf.random_normal(tf.shape(x))
>>> y.get_shape()
TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(None)])

I would have expected TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(12)]) instead.
