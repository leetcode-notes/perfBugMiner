Retrieve a graph or model without copying the graph construction code

Hi,
Let's say I have defined a graph and trained the weights in file "myTrain.py" and I saved the model using tf.train.saver() in a directory.
I want to have a tester file (let's name it "myTest.py") which doesn't contain the definition of the graph, but be able to load the saved graph and also the trained weights and I can use it as I was using in "myTrain.py". For example, pass a new batch with feed_dict and get the desired outputs.
I know there are many sources about how to save and restore the graph, but all of them are confusing or they have the definition of the graph as a piece of code written before loading the saved model which I believe shouldn't be needed.
I appreciate any help.
Thanks
