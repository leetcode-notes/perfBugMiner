Fix the doc of tf.contrib.lookup.MutableHashTable insert operation

This PR is to fix #17835.
Document on MutableHashTable is confusing, especially in this line:

table.insert(keys, values)

This code is unexecutable and misleading, it suggests insert is done inplace rather than an operation that need to be executed afterwards.

sess.run(table.insert(keys, values))
