Feature request - Check that QueueRunner enqueue ops use the correct queue

The documentation for tf.train.QueueRunner.__init__ states:
"The enqueue ops do not have to all be the same op, but it is expected that they all enqueue tensors in queue."
Would it be possible for tensorflow to check that the given ops do in fact enqueue tensors in the correct queue, and throw an error if they do not?  I encountered a problem recently where I mistakenly passed the wrong queue to my QueueRunner, and as a result, the clean shutdown behavior described here wasn't working as expected.  Changing to the correct queue solved the problem.  This was definitely user error on my part, but it was a bit tricky to track this problem down, and it seems like the kind of thing that would be possible to check automatically.
