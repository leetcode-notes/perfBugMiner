dtype of methods in tensorflow.contrib.distributions does not depend on self.dtype

In master (f4a0c2c) (and versions such as r1.0), the docstring in log_prob() claims to return a tensor which has the same dtype as the distributions' dtype. This is not true for the built-in distributions. For example:
>>> from tensorflow.contrib import distributions as ds
>>>>
>>> x = ds.Bernoulli(p=0.5)
>>> x.dtype
tf.int32
>>> x.log_prob(1)
<tf.Tensor 'Bernoulli_1/log_prob/Neg:0' shape=() dtype=float32>
This inconsistency also occurs for many methods beyond log_prob().
