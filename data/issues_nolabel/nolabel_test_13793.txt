Tensorflow not detecting GPU even when CUDA is installed

Hi there,
I am running the following on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and I have GPU 1070 and tensorflow version 1.0.1 (installed and checked through conda -list
I am trying to run a simple piece of code in tf
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
with tf.Session() as sess:
print (sess.run(c))
And I am getting the following error:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device to node 'MatMul_1': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no devices matching that specification are registered in this process; available devices: /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0
Regarding the CUDA installed, I have the following information obtained by running nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2016 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_Jan_10_13:22:03_CST_2017
Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61
Theano is able to detect and use GPU
Using gpu device 0: GeForce GTX 1070 (CNMeM is disabled, cuDNN 5110)
How to get TF to use the GPU. Or what CUDA version should I install to make it work with GPU.
I understand this is not the platform to ask questions related to CUDA but if someone can point me in the right direction then it will be helpful.
Thank You.
