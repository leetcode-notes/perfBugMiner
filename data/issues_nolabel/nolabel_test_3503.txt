Installing tensorflow on windows through Docker

Hi,
I've successfully installed docker toolbox and created a container but when I enter
docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
I get "Unable to find image 'docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow' loally"
I have read on other threads that this might be due to space allocation so this container already has 20gb.
What do I do? I've got a Windows 10 Pro.
Thanks a lot!
