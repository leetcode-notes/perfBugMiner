Ability to Save Checkpoints Every N Steps using Estimator

TensorFlow Version: r0.10.0rc0
For TensorFlow/SKFlow/tf,learn Estimators, there is no option for specifying when an Estimator saves checkpoints other than save_checkpoints_secs in a RunConfig, which isn't usable for a monitor such as ValidationMonitor. For example, if I want to do early stopping and check every 10 steps, it is definitely not guaranteed that new checkpoints were saved for the model, even if I specify save_checkpoints_secs to be 1 second.
Tried:
It is currently not possible to use a CheckpointMonitor with an Estimator (e.g. LinearClassifier) as far as I can tell. There is no saver nor Scaffold I can specify that captures the same variables it does normally.
When can we expect this capability, and are there workarounds currently?
