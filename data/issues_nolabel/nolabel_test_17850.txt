Describe the problem
There has been significant community effort to build Tensorflow from source for ARM (e.g. https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi and https://github.com/lhelontra/tensorflow-on-arm).  It would be great to get these as part of the official/nightly builds.  Python wheel/libtensorflow.so/libtensorflow_framework.so binaries.
