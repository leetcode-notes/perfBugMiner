Map Staging Area

I liked the idea of StagingArea but I wanted more functionality out of it. I've implemented an Associative StagingArea backed by C++ std::map and std::unordered_map.
Functionality:

Keys are int64, Values are just like StagingArea Tensors or list of Tensors.
put(key, value), get(key),  pop(key), popitem(), size(), clear() operations
Can choose ordered std::map (Get a basic priority queue with popitem()) or unordered std::unordered.
Can specify a capacity which inserts will wait on, if not, it will be unbounded.

Have tested that this works on CPU + GPU in a custom op library. I haven't tested the compile on my laptop due to #9634, but I've cut and pasted the relevant sections into the tensorflow code base for your perusal.
Let me know if you're keen to merge this and I can clean it up a bit further.
