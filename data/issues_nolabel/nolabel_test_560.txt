Syntax error when building with python3

i followed the instructions to install Tensorflow from sources. However, before finishing the installation of the wheel with pip3 a SyntaxError: invalid syntax comes up. The error doesn't abort the installation, but when i'm trying to import Tensorflow it shows this error:
 >>> import tensorflow as tf

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

with python 2.7 it shows no such error and it works fine... it seems that the sources are not compatible with python3.4.
i'm running on Ubuntu 14.04 with python 3.4.3 and GCC 4.8.4.
