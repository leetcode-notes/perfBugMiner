ImportError: No module named tools (missing __init__.py?)

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: none
If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD): fc91629
The output of bazel version:

Build label: 0.3.0
Build target: bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/BazelServer_deploy.jar
Build time: Fri Jun 10 11:38:23 2016 (1465558703)
Build timestamp: 1465558703
Build timestamp as int: 1465558703

Steps to reproduce

Create a new IPython Notebook
Run the following:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.tools import freeze_graph

What have you tried?
It seems that the tools directory is missing an __init__.py (though there is one in the python directory), and so tools isn't being recognized as a module. However, this is a bit baffling, because freeze_graph_test.py uses these exact same import statements. Just to be sure, I tried copying in all the import statements in freeze_graph_test.py:
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

import os

import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow.python.framework import test_util
from tensorflow.python.tools import freeze_graph

and sure enough, freeze_graph was the only one that gave an error.
__init__.py doesn't appear in the repository on GitHub as well. I noticed there's a Bazel BUILD file instead, but as far as I know, Bazel is only used to build the Android demo. Am I missing something?
