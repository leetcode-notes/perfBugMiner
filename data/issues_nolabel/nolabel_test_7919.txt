Warning during compilation on OS/X

... and maybe other systems too.
the warning is
./tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/backend.h:37:1: warning: class 'ThreadPoolDevice' was previously declared as a struct [-Wmismatched-tags]

It appears on almost every file in the XLA compiler directory, making the spotting of real problems harder.
