If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I am build a 4 layer network (1286464*32), input_unit feature size 20000000（sparse feature size）,  when train the model ,it errors that "Tensor slice is too large to serialize".
my training code is like this https://github.com/tobegit3hub/deep_recommend_system/blob/master/a8a_classifier.py
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
nothing , it's seems that a protobuf limitation , but I want to know how to solve this with changes in my training code
Logs or other output that would be helpful
