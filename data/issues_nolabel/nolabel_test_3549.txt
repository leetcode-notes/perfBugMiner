Android: NoOpKernel was registered to support Op 'TensorflowArray' DynamicRNN

I'm trying to load a graph I trained in python, which includes only using dynamicRNN, and the most basic RNN cell.
When I try execute the graph on the Android, I get the following error message:
Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'TensorArray' with these attrs
     [[Node: c96ce52cccd5408aad2fb356a8246023/RNN/TensorArray_1 = TensorArray[clear_after_read=true, dtype=DT_FLOAT, dynamic_size=false, tensor_array_name="c96ce52cccd5408aad2fb356a8246023/RNN/dynamic_rnn/input"](c96ce52cccd5408aad2fb356a8246023/RNN/unpack)]]

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu x64 14.04
Android 6.0
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
tag v0.9.0
The output of bazel version
0.3.0

Steps to reproduce

Create RNN model in python
Compile it with tensorflow_android_lib targeting armv7
Try run the model on android

What have you tried?
