Fix compiler error mentioned in #16960 introduced by commit 1baac78627

Addressing #16960.
The commit 1baac78 introduced member functions MklSubAllocator::AddAllocVisitor and MklSubAllocator::AddFreeVisitor which respectively use allocator_->AddAllocVisitor and allocator_->AddFreeVisitor but allocator_ is of type Allocator * which doesn't have these member functions.
I am guessing the intention was to change the type of allocator_ to BFCAllocator* to make this work.
