GPU_Base dockerfile image not found

I'm attempting to use the GPU dockerfile to build an image with gpu support, however it points at b.gcr.io/tensorflow-testing/tensorflow-full which doesn't appear to be accessible. The image at b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow-full doesn't have CUDA in it, is there a different image I need to point the script at?
