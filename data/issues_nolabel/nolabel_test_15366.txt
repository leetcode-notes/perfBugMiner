fix that remove_nodes drops input suffixes

The transform remove_nodes didn't take input suffixes into consideration, and might make mistakes if the removed node used not :0 but :1.
E.g.: For a node of /a/Identity (Identity): [/a/Switch_1:1], the old code will make the pb file generate completely unexpected outputs.
The clang-format checking and tests (//tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/...) have been passed.
