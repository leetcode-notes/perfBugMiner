Generate additional cudart linkopts in cuda_configure.

Currently, the target @local_config_cuda//cuda:cudart_static contains a
select() condition that references the @//tensorflow:darwin config
condition.
While this is fine when building out of the tensorflow workspace, this breaks
the build for serving and other projects that vendor TF since those workspaces
do not have a //tensorflow:darwin target (under serving, that label would be
//tensorflow/tensorflow:darwin under the current setup).
This change removes the select() and moves the logic for generating additional
platform-specific linkopts for cudart_static into cuda_configure, making the
@local_config_cuda workspace more self-contained.
