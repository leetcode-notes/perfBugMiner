Couldn't open CUDA library libcudnn.so. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: :/usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64

I have a system where I installed CUDA 7.5 for TensorFlow 0.10.0. The specs of my system is written in #4825 . However, I have a small problem when importing tensorflow in my Python 3.5.2
Screenshot of the problem.

Any help would be great!
