Tensorflow failed to compile

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source from branch r1.7, did not compile
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.12.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.3.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:  ./configure && bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
While compiling tensorflow build failed. I just pulled the latest commit(92e6c3e) from the r1.7 branch. I also updated bazel (from 0.11.1 to 0.12.0) and some other programs(should be irrelevant to tensorflow) beforehand.

UPDATE: The r1.8 branch compiles successfully. The 1.8 branch might have a fix? Or perhaps a dependency was updated and that fixed it?
