Modified README for docker

Please accept my PR! I'm trying to get a hacktoberfest tshirt and I'm new to opensource, just trying to get my feet wet with how PRs work on github.
I was skimming alot of information about docker and tensorflow online and when I came to the section of the readme I changed I had to stop and read carefully for a second to think about what was happening there, when I should have just skipped over it and kept going. Just added a comment that made it even more explicit that this code snipped is outdated and not recommended.
