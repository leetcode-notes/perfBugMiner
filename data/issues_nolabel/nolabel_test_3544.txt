Should *.pb.h files be generated in cross-compile cases?

A few days ago, I have tried to import the tensorflow project directly into Android Studio on Windows and use Gradle to build the project. Header files with suffix ".pb.h" are not generated. Google says bazel should be used to build the project. Now I use bazel on Linux to build it again with CPU=arm64-v8a using the following command
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_native_libs --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=$CPU --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain
as in the issue #3444 .
However header files with suffix ".pb.h" are still not generated. Android Studio cannot find the include file and hence the build procedure cannot be continued. Is there any method to use tensorflow C++ library in Android Studio?
