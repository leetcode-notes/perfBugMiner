Test CMake entries against filetree

There were some invalid entries in tensorflow/contrib/cmake/tf_python.cmake which are removed as of #10294 and which were discovered alongside #10264 @drpngx where I proposed extracting all file glob entries from all CMake files for better management as well as automated testing for their validity to keep things safe and sound.
