'No module named tensorflow'  error in jupyter notebook after installing tensorflow-gpu using pip in the same virtual environment. I am using python 2.7.12.

I am trying to use tensorflow-gpu on Ubuntu16.04. I installed tensorflow via pip inside virtual environment, and other required libraries. When I start jupyter notebook in the same environment and try to run a code that uses tensorflow, the line 'import tensorflow as tf' gives an error.
It says no module named tensorflow. I had a similar problem with skimage(I initially installed scikit-image instead of python-skimage and I was getting an error. But it got resolved after I installed the right library. However I can't make sense of why it can't find the tensorflow module.
