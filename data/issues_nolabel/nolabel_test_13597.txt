Describe the problem
Production machine not hooked up to Internet. Used pip3 to install tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl  It looks the profile code may be missing from the wheel.
When run tensorflow with the following code:
import tensorflow as tf
with tf.contrib.tfprof.ProfileContext(FLAGS.log_dir + '\\test', trace_steps=[], dump_steps=[]) as pctx:

get error:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.tfprof' has no attribute 'ProfileContext'

It appears that the examples in the https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/profiler Readme.md  may be obsolete.
