remove ":arm" to build tflite on ARM64 linux

When build TF Lite related stuff such as lable_image for tflite on ARMv64 non-Android environment (I am running Debian on an internal development board). I saw something like:
/home/freedom/work/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/internal/BUILD:264:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/internal:neon_tensor_utils' failed (Exit 1)
 gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-mfpu=neon'
 gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-mfloat-abi=softfp'

It seems ARM64 falls into the ":arm" category. After removing it, I can build my tflite-based command line programs without problems.
