gcc: error trying to exec 'as': execvp: No such file or directory

I think the problem is that as wasn't installed with gcc and thus gcc -print-prog-name=as just prints as. as is in my path, but not in the same location as gcc.
$ which gcc
/appl/gcc/4.9.2/bin/gcc
$ which as
/appl/binutils/2.25.1/bin/as

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
there are a couple:

Building TensorFlow with custom GCC requires hardcoded ld,nm and as bazelbuild/bazel#1713 â€“ I tried setting build --action_env=PATH, but that did change anything.

What other attempted solutions have you tried?

I've tried symlinking gcc and as into the same path, but then cc1 and the gcc header files can't be found.
I've tried searching for how bazel or tensorflow finds as but I can't find that code.
