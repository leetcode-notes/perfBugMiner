Dockerfile.devel-gpu: optimize the size of the generated image

Use nvidia/cuda:9.0-base-ubuntu16.04 as the base image to select
just the CUDA libraries we need.
Remove the installed static libraries.
Remove the dependency on openjdk-8 since Bazel ships with a local copy.
Perform a shallow clone of the repository.

The image is 2.94GB, down from 4.87GB.
