Make RNN cells add bias to the bias variable collection

Currently helper layers like fully_connected add their bias variables to the 'bias' collection, which is a useful convenience. The RNN cell code doesn't do that, and it would be nice if it did for consistency. Needless to say the same is true for the main weights and the 'weights' collection.
