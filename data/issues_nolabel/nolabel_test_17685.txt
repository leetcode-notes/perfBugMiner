Fix format issue in ffmpeg

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #17533 where some ouput generated by ffmpeg may not be parsed correctly.
There are two issues in the ffmpeg parser:

The size of the frame could be rgb24, 640x360 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], with extra [...] after 640x360.
The number of frames could be frame=12488 or frame= 166, with or without the sapce ( in between frame= and the number).

This fix fixes the parser issues in ffmpeg.
This fix fixes #17533.
