Checkpoints default values for RunConfig

With save_checkpoints_secs having a default value (of 600), the call to RunConfig fails if only save_checkpoints_steps is passed. To address this, the value is defaulted only if both the parameters are None. In this new way, the call to RunConfig will not fail if only save_checkpoints_steps is passed
