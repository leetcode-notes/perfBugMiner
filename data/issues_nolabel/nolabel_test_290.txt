Check code description in seq2seq.py - embedding_rnn_seq2seq

I'm checking the codes line by line to understand how TF works.
Please check following comments are correct or not.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/seq2seq.py#L198-L199
It seems that the encoder_inputs for embedding_rnn_seq2seq should have indexs of vocabularies.
 encoder_inputs: [batch_size] 
 decoder_inputs: [batch_size] 
If not, give some tips to understand it.
