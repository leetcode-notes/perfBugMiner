optional arguments should be optional

the input_op_fn appears to be optional (it has a default value), but the default value is trash and causes the function to crash with a less than useful argument.
I don't have the skill to fix the rnn.py function at the moment, but it seems to me that the null_input_op_fn should make some guess at how the data should be unwrapped rather than just return something that will cause a crash.
