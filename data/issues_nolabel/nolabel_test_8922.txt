Android tiny-yolo model

I was successfully able to run tiny-yolo-voc.pb on android. However, when I tried to run tiny-yolo.pb (which is for coco dataset) generated from https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow , the app crashes with java.nio.BufferOverflowException.
Could you please point out what needs to be changed in the code to be able to run tiny-yolo.
Thanks
