Feature request
The tf.Print op lets us print tensor values when it gets evaluated. However, it does not provide any way to access the raw data programmatically. AFAIK, there is no way to access this data during computation. Please correct me if I'm wrong
With Theano, I was able to provide a custom callback to the printing facility, to access the tensor values when tensor was evaluated. This is extremely useful for image tensors for instance to be able to plot them at evaluation time. With TF I cannot do that.
Basically, what I am proposing is adding a custom callback parameter to the op:
Print(
    input_,
    data,
    message=None,
    first_n=None,
    summarize=None,
    callback=None,
    name=None
)

If callback is undefined, tf.Print behavior remains identical. Otherwise, tf.Print will call the callback with `([values], message, name).
