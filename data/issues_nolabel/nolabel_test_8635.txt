Add check op for assert valid sample in Bernoulli for contrib.distributions

Title. The style for asserts seemed to vary across the distribution implementations. I followed Binomial's. It implements _maybe_assert_valid_sample and checks via utility functions such as embed_check_nonnegative_discrete in distributions_util.py.
Fixes #8583. Feedback appreciated. After merging, I can submit a PR adding similar asserts for other discrete distributions.
