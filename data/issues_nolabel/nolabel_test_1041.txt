Build pip package from source failed

I got the following error while building pip package from the master version
tensorflow/core/BUILD:75:1: Target '//google/protobuf:protobuf_python_genproto' is not visible from target '//tensorflow/core:protos_all_py_genproto'. Check the visibility declaration of the former target if you think the dependency is legitimate.
Bazel version 0.1.4 and 0.1.5
