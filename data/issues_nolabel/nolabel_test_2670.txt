Add a method to remove entries from registry.

I'm using this to remove incompatible shape functions from the registry to make "immediate" tensors work as a drop-in replacement for regular TensorFlow tensors.
Since "static shape inference" doesn't make sense for persistent tensors, I'm returning Dimension(None) for the shape for such tensors. But, there's at least one shape function which doesn't allow Dimension(None) -- (_ReverseShape(op):), so as a work-around, I'm using unregister followed byregister(None)`
