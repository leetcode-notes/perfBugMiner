TensorFlow with Cuda 7.5 on Ubuntu 15.4?

Hi,
I have not been able to install GPU TensorFlow on my Ubuntu 15.04 workstation because it seems to require Cuda 7.0, while I am running Cuda 7.5. As far as I can tell there are no Cuda 7.0 installs available for Ubuntu 15.04. Are there any patches/upgrades that will make it possible for me to use TensorFlow on my system? Or do I right now have to downgrade my Ubuntu in order to be able to work with it?
Thanks,
Bojan
