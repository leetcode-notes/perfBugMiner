use lib static tensorflow-core.a error when build

undefined reference to 'google::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string' ....
i think my program can't find lib protobuf to used. Even I have already lib protbuf.a and protobuf.so. Before i use lib tensorflow-core.a I have used lib dynamic: tensorflow_cc.so and lib tensorflow_framework.so i build with bazel, and lib protbuf.so include. I don't know ho to fix this error. Can anyone help me?
