ResidualWrapper and HighwayWrapper require rnn inputs' last dimension to be equal to num_units

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): -
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):  v1.4.0-rc1-11-g130a514 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce:

from tensorflow.contrib import rnn as rnn_cell
from tensorflow.python.ops import rnn
import tensorflow as tf

rnn_inputs = tf.random_uniform([10, 10, 10])
cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(128)
cell = rnn_cell.HighwayWrapper(cell) # rnn_cell.ResidualWrapper(cell)
_, _ = rnn.dynamic_rnn(cell, rnn_inputs, dtype=tf.float32)
Problem
rnn_cell.ResidualWrapper and rnn_cell.HighwayWrapper throw an exception when rnn inputs' last dimension is not equal to num_units. Without wrappers, the input tensor can be different from num_units.
What's the reason for the different behaviour? Is it intended?
