Fix tutorial docs

Dear TensorFlow maintainers,
I noticed a missing closing ) for the tf.constant function in r0.12 and r0.11 of tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/input_fn/index.md. This is a fix for the r0.12 docs.
Should I submit a separate PR for the r0.11 documentation too, or will this suffice?
Thanks
