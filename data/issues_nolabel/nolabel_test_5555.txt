This is a regression of issue #3826.
Environment info
Operating System: macOS Sierra Version 10.12.1 (16B2555)
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: cuda_8.0.47_mac, cudnn-8.0-osx-x64-v5.1 (I explain why I am using cuDNN v5.1 rather than cuDNN v5 below.)

If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed: export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/gpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-py2-none-any.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source: Not Applicable
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)


Set up TensorFlow according to the instructions at
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#prepare_environment_for_mac_os_x
In particular, the page says to install cuDNN v5 from the cuDNN Download page.


Test the installation by running:
 cuda-memcheck python -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional

You should see:

E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:368] Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 5005 (compatibility version 5000) but source was compiled with 5105 (compatibility version 5100).  If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime matches a compatible version specified during compile configuration.



What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Uninstalling cuDNN v5 and installing cuDNN v5.1 (labeled "cuDNN v5.1 (August 10, 2016), for CUDA 8.0" on the cuDNN Download page) fixes the issue.
As before in issue #3826, the installation instructions should be corrected to specify that cuDNN v5.1 needs to be installed.
