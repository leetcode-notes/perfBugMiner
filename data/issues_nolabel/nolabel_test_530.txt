Tensorboard from pip installation broken

Tensorboard tries to load a file here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py#L145
but tensorboard/TAG is missing from the pip installation, so it produces the following message:
WARNING:tensorflow:IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/TAG' on path /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/TAG
WARNING:tensorflow:Unable to read TensorBoard tag
Starting TensorBoard  on port 6006
(You can navigate to http://localhost:6006)

and does not render any logged events.
