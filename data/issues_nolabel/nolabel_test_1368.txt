svhn: tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:1027] 0x2076650 Compute status: Invalid argument: Indices are not valid (out of bounds).  Shape: dim { size: 128 } dim { size: 10 }

When I tried to train model by SVHN data I faced the above exception.
Stackoverflow link is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35756236/tensorflow-tried-svhn-by-editing-label-0-9-still-not-working
Did I did something wrong/ missed any logic or is it a bug?
Please help me. I have already attempted in several ways but could not figure out the reason.
Thanks
