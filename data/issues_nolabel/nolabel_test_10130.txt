tf.contrib.data: No op named OneShotIterator in defined operations

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (nightly build from May 23rd)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.2.0-rc0-172-g9e25de3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

python3 save.py
python3 load.py

Describe the problem
I'm playing around with the new tf.contrib.data stuff because it looks awesome and can make a lot of my code a lot simpler. However, I'm trying to save and restore a graph that contains these new ops. Saving works fine, but loading doesn't work. If I inspect the saved file, it seems to be serializing everything correctly, I recognize the structure of all the data set ops I added in the code so that seems fine. In the case of the below example, I'm getting an error No op named OneShotIterator in defined operations when trying to load the graph again.

save.py
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.range(10)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x + 2)
batched_dataset = dataset.batch(4)

iterator = batched_dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
next_element = iterator.get_next()

tf.add_to_collection('next', next_element)
tf.train.export_meta_graph(filename='graph', as_text=True)
load.py
import tensorflow as tf

tf.train.import_meta_graph('graph')
next_element = tf.get_collection('next')[0]

sess = tf.Session()

print(sess.run(next_element))
load.py output
