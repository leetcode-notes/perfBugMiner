Modified tests for gradients

While implementing gradients for some new functions, I forgot to propagate the grad argument in the definition of the derivative in tensorflow/python/ops/math_grad.py. The wrong implementation passed all the tests because the derivative of the function is evaluated in isolation.
Multiplying the TensorFlow operation by a constant a ensures that such errors are caught by the tests.  This PR implements the modified tests with a = 1.1.
