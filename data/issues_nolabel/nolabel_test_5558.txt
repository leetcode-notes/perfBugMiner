Add string tensor tags to new summary interface

Old/Deprecated summary ops can accept string tensors for tags. The new summary interface only allows strings for names (subsequently used as tags). This pull adds prefix option, which can be a string tensor.
This is important because sometimes we want to define the tags symbolically based on some conditions of input placeholders.
