Fix `go generate` error in case multiple directories in GOPATH exist

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #7136 where go generate will produce an error when multiple directories in GOPATH exists.
The issue is because, in case multiple directories exist in GOPATH, the following line in generate.sh will not work:
cd $(dirname $0)
TF_DIR=${GOPATH}/src/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
PROTOC="${TF_DIR}/bazel-out/host/bin/external/protobuf/protoc"

This fix address the issue by iterating througgh each directory in GOPATH so that protoc (${PROTOC}) could be correctly located:
for g in $(echo $GOPATH | sed "s/:/ /g"); do
    TF_DIR="${g}/src/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow"
    PROTOC="${TF_DIR}/bazel-out/host/bin/external/protobuf/protoc"
    if [ -x "${PROTOC}" ]; then
        break
    fi
done

This fix fixes #7136.
