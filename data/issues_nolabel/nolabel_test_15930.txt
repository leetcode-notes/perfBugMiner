Discontinuity at halfway point in graph output

I have written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
to reproduce the error:



convert HnH_gate.txt to HnH_gate.py


Edit mypath in out() method at end of file for your system.  Save


in python: run HnH_gate.py


run out() to create csv files for the good and bad output
i) out("101", new_probka_good)
ii) out("102", new_probka_bad)


Plot data from hh_101.csv and hh_102.csv and verify the discontinuity at half way point in hh_102.csv


Two additional tests can be run:
i) Edit parameter timepoints in main() to show error remaps to half way point.
ii) My temporary correction is to create 2x points and throw half away.  this is done in p_update() setting cut_in_half = True


This same error was found running the code in Tensorflow 1.4 on MacOS Sierra.  My system info is:

Describe the problem
I am running a RNN for a Hodgkin and Huxley type gating of an ion channel protein
called HnH_gate.py.
The program takes a placeholder vmem and produces a timeseries output of the size
timepoints.
At the halfway point in the timeseries there is a discontinuity in the results
This only appears with some arrays fed to my tf.placeholder.  Others produce normal
results.  I can correct for the problem by doubling the number of timepoints requested
and throwing half away.
The array:
vmem_list_good = [[-100.0, -90.0, -80.0, -70.0, -60.0, -50.0, -41.0, -30.0, -20.0, -10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0],
[-100.0, -90.0, -80.0, -70.0, -60.0, -50.0, -41.0, -30.0, -20.0, -10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0]]
appears to work perfectly
The array:
vmem_list_bad = [[80.0, 60.0, 40.0, 20.0, 00.0, -20.0, -41.0, -60.0, -80.0, -55.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0],
[70.0, 50.0, 30.0, 10.0, -10.0, -30.0, -50.0, -70.0, -90.0, -30.0, -10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]]
shows the error.
To see my temporary correction, edit the parameter in the HH.p_update() method
to: cut_in_half = True
I have written a short output routine to export the simulation to a csv file,
just edit the path and provide a string to make a unique filename:
out("101", new_probka_good)
out("102", new_probka_bad)
Source code / logs
program file is: HnH_gate.py (provided as HnH_gate.txt)
HnH_gate.txt  (convert to HnH_gate.py)
HnH_gate.txt
System and Error Description: HnH_gate_bug_report.txt
HnH_gate_bug_report.txt
Output example demonstrating problem: Artifact plotting new_probka_bad.py

Thanks for your help.
