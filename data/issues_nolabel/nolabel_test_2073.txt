solve compatibility issue for ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS has update default gcc to 5.3 and string.h as well, even we install a gcc-4.9,
we will get a bug like
usr/include/string.h: In function 'void* __mempcpy_inline(void*, const void*, size_t)':
/usr/include/string.h:652:42: error: 'memcpy' was not declared in this scope
     return (char *) memcpy (__dest, __src, __n) + __n;

this bus is described in #1346
and can be solved by
insert cxx_flag: "-D_FORCE_INLINES" into tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/CROSSTOOL
