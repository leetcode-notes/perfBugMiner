Enable validate_args for all distributions based on a global parameter

The probability distributions in Tensorflow have a validate_args argument that is initially set to False. This PR adds a feature that initializes the value of validate_args to the value of a global flag validate_args_default, which can be set from the user program
Rationale: Currently, when the user sets up the model incorrectly e.g. wrong parameter values are provided for the distributions, or data values don't match the support for the distribution, the program silently fails and produces nans in the output (or worse, wrong values). The user has no way to debug this easily because validate_args is False by default, and manually adding validate_args=True while initializing each distribution can be tedious for the user.
