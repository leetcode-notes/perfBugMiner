Wrong type in rnn function

I think the type of zero_output in line 135 in (rnn.py) should be dtype and not inputs[0].dtype as it is right now. If the cell output is a float, this will trigger an exception in the select statement in _rnn_step function in line (298) of the type
TypeError: Input 'e' of 'Select' Op has type float32 that does not match type int32 of argument 't'.
when the inputs of the cells are int. I don't have a short piece of code to reproduce this, but if needed I can produce one.
