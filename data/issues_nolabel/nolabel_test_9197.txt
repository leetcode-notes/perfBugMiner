HDF5 QueueOp

I wrote this internally and got the okay to release it. There are some changes I would need to make before it is ready for general use (naming, passing in a file name, etc.), but generally it works.
The way I made it work was to have HDF5 structure like file/group/queue_output0 so if there are many datasets, they get returned as different outputs of the queue. I can easily change this to make it more generic.
If there is interest, I can make the fixes and get it up to standard. One general concern that you might have is that I spawn std::threads inside the operation to facilitate access to the HDF5 file and I also have a FIFOQueue as a member variable so I can populate two different queues with the write and read requests.
Let me know what should be changed it you would like an HDF5 reader op
