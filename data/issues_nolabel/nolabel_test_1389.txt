Tensorflow tutorial "How to Retrain": error when saving the model

For bugs/issues, please fill in the following.  The more information you
provide, the more likely we can help you.
hello,
I am trying to run the tutorial 'How to Retrain Inception's Final Layer for New Categories'
available here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed: I use the following AWS community AMI:
Axel TensorFlow machine - ami-a41147ce   in Northern Virginia region.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)":

I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:101] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so.7.0 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:101] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.6.5 locally

0.5.0
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
Steps to reproduce
step 1. download and unpack images: curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
tar xzf flower_photos.tgz
step 2. run:    python retrain.py --image_dir ~/flower_photos
What have you tried?

nothing: I do not know what to do

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
the only difference with the tutorial is that I do not use Bazel, I just do:
python retrain.py --image_dir ~/flower_photos
Everything runs smoothly, until I get this error:
Final test accuracy = 91.6%
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "retrain.py", line 829, in

output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'convert_variables_to_constants'
The problematic portion of the code is:
Write out the trained graph and labels with the weights stored as constants.
output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
sess, graph.as_graph_def(), [FLAGS.final_tensor_name])
with gfile.FastGFile(FLAGS.output_graph, 'wb') as f:
f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())
with gfile.FastGFile(FLAGS.output_labels, 'w') as f:
f.write('\n'.join(image_lists.keys()) + '\n')
What should I do?
