Saver optimistic restore

Hello,
I have a feature request about Saver. Is it possible to add an option to stop it from complaining about absent variables in a checkpoint? Quite often when I experiment with different architectures, I change layers between runs, but want to reuse pretrained earlier checkpoints. An option "just restore whatever you can from this checkpoint without complaining" would be very useful. Now I play with var_list, but find it tiring and error-prone. Another idea is to retrieve variable names from a given checkpoint, but I couldn't find API for that.
