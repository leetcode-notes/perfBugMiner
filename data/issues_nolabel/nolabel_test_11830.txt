Fixes #11829: Faster to import tensorflow.contrib on Python 3

As described in #11829, a lot of time is spent doing inspect.stack() when importing import tensorflow.contrib with Python 3. (There does not seem to be any issue with Python 2.)
By replacing _inspect.stack() with only getting the current and previous frame and then getting the frame info for just the previous frame, this unnecessary overhead is removed.
The time to import tensorflow.contrib, as reported by time python2/3 -c "import tensorflow.contrib" before and after my commit:



When
Python 2.7.13
Python 3.6.2




before
3.2
7.5


after
3.1
3.3

There are unit tests that would catch if the decorator_name would be incorrect after my change, specifically these tests:

testSetsDecoratorNameToFunctionThatCallsMakeDecoratorIfAbsent
testUnwrapReturnsDecoratorListFromOutermostToInnermost
testUnwrapBoundMethods

All Python unit tests passed (in Docker). I didn't find any issues when linting the changed file.
