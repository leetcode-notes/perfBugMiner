Implement strided slice (stride > 2) in tf2xla

Before, strides are not acceptable in strided_slice where the stride > 1 (or < -1).
This uses a concatenation of normal slices to implement strided_slice.
For backends where all tensor slicing/padding/concating/striding are just index manipulation, this implementation is as efficient as any other.
