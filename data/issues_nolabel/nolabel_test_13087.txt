Deallocation messages broken

The only way to calculate peak memory in OSS TensorFlow is to make memory timeline by parsing allocation/deallocation messages (possibly using helpers like this)
Sometime between TF 1.0.1 and TF 1.1, the deallocation messages stopped including allocation id, so you can't track when each tensor got deallocated.
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = ''
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL'] = '1'
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = ''
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

sess = tf.Session()
a = tf.ones((1000,1000))
sess.run(a)

In TF 1.0.1 you see this
2017-09-16 13:24:28: I tensorflow/core/framework/log_memory.cc:35] __LOG_MEMORY__ MemoryLogTensorDeallocation { allocation_id: 1 allocator_name: "cpu" }
In latest TF you see this
2017-09-16 13:25:04.422108: I tensorflow/core/framework/log_memory.cc:35] __LOG_MEMORY__ MemoryLogTensorDeallocation { allocator_name: "cpu" }
Note that deallocation id is missing in later version
