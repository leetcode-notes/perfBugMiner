Documentation and error messages for tf.tile, tf.constant leave a lot to be desired

I noticed that a protocol buffer did the equivalent of
tf.tile( x, [] )
and wondered what that actually produced (the documentation was completely unhelpful).  So I tried
x = tf.Variable([1.,2.,3.,4.])
y = tf.tile(x,tf.constant(2))
to get started, and got the message "ValueError: Shape () must have rank 1".  So I tried
y = tf.tile(x,tf.constant([2]))
and got the same message(!).  tf.rank(tf.constant([2])) of course returned the value 1, so the message made no sense at all to me.
In my struggle to get an acceptable empty tensor, I tried
x = tf.constant(shape=[],dtype="int32")
This produced the memorable message "TypeError: constant() takes at least 1 argument (2 given)"
I eventually discovered that tf.tile returns 1 copy of its tensor when the input is an empty list.  It would have been so helpful if the documentation would have just stated this fact...
Searching for tf.tile bugs produced a number of references to the documentation and a lot of hits relating to roofs.
