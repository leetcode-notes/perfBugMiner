Cannot find cudnn, but cudnn (5005) works with my Theano install

I just installed tensorflow from source with no errors but upon running the example from the "get started" page...
$ cd tensorflow/models/image/mnist
$ python convolutional.py
I receive the error that cudnn cannot be found. Here is the full output:

I am not sure what to try because cudnn works with Theano on this machine, it also states that it finds the GPU.
