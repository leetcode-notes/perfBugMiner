TensorBoard logdir assignment issue

Dear all,
As instructed I type
$tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflowlogs --debug
but the debug message showing that the tensorboard logdir is still in my working dir.
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard path_to_run is: {'/home/USER_NAME/Documents/workspace/python_dir/tensor_test/=': None}
However after I deleted the "=" sign and replace it with a space
$tensorboard --logdir /tmp/tensorflowlogs --debug
the debug message show the right direcory
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard path_to_run is: {'/tmp/tensorflowlogs': None}
I don't know its a typo or something in the instruction.
So just FYI
