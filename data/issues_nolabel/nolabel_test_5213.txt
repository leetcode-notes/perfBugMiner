dyld: lazy symbol binding failed

I use OSX10.12, I try to use OpenCV in tensorflow, I use the first method which is mentioned here.
I build my code successfully but there are some questions as following when I execute it:
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: __ZN2cv6String8allocateEm Referenced from: /Users/philokey/Practice/github/tensorflow/./bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/test_cv/test_cv Expected in: flat namespace
The build file is as following:
cc_binary(
name = "test_cv",
srcs = [
    "test_cv.cc",
],
deps = [
    "@opencv//:opencv",
],
)

How can I sovle this problem?
By the way, the question is also asked in stackoverflow
