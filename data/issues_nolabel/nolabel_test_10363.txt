TensorBoard: Graph Visualization failed Runtime statistics

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Debian 8 (jessie)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): using virtualenv, pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 7.5, cuDNN 4.0
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX TITAN X 12GB
Exact command to reproduce: Run this https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py scripts.

Describe the problem
I am following the tutorials in https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz, downloading and running the mnist_with_summaries.py scripts.
All the Tensorboard visualization works, except the Runtime statistics. In the GRAPHS tab, the Session runs shows (0) items available. And it says 'None'.
