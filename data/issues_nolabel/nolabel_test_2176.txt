setting allocated memory of gpu

By using options like gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.333) , it gives  the process this fraction of free gpu's memory. it means when you want to give a process an exact value of memory you must change the fractions due to running sequence of processes. For example if you want to run 2 process simultaneously with half of the memory you have to run the first one with 0.5 fraction and the second one with 1.0 fraction.
Is there any way to allocate an exact  size for each process (for example 2gb)?
