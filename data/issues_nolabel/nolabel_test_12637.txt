Adding image captioning examples for iOS (Im2txt)

This is my first ever contribution, so please bear with me.
Recently I've worked to implement image captioning with TensorFlow on iOS. To get a sense of what this is like, you can check out my app. I've added an image captioning demo, along with links to the necessary graph and labels - I hope people find it helpful. On modern phones, inference should take a little more than a second.
Due to the constraints of the C++ API, you'll see that I often have to traverse tensors using a for-loop. Less than ideal, but it seems to do the job.
If you have any questions, concerns, or critique, l'm happy to answer them! (here or via email: liamnakagawa [at] hunterschools.org)
