Install from sources: Error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file

I recently tried to install Tensorflow on Ubuntu 14.10. I had cuda 7.0 and cudnn 3.0, so I had to install from sources following the instructions. I got "error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file" when building the pip package (with GPU support):
$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
So far, I have set the configuration for cuda and cudnn correctly. What should I do? Thanks.
