Misleading error message when using "empty" variables

The code below fails with "Attempting to use uninitialized value Variable". This came up here and makes debugging harder. Maybe instead it should fail during Variable creation or Shape inference with "Variable must have non-zero size"
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
empty = np.zeros(shape=(0, 0) )
a = tf.Variable(empty)
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
sess.run(tf.reduce_sum(a))
