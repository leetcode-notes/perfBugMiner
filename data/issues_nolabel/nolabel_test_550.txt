Translate.py - hard to detect convergence

In the Sequence to Sequence machine translation example - the training pipeline only outputs perplexity numbers which are hard to interpret. If it could also output some sample translations it would be much easier for people to measure convergence
Anecdotally perplexities of around ~5 result in horrible translations - has anyone gotten it to work, and if so, what perplexities did you need to reach before you started getting reasonable translations?
