realtime bounding box

i use tensorflow project for android
I trained my custom datsets by yolo and then i made pb file.
This detected bounding box where i used picture not realtime
But when i put yolo file  in the android project, this cannot detect.
So i screenshot the scene of android project and i trained this screenshot in pc by darkflow.
It detected well. I don't know why. I think option value is correct. plz help me T.T
