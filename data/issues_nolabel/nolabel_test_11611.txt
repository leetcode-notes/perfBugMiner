estimators/SVM_test.py included in test suite?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No custom code
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
VERSION="16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus)"
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Installed from source, master branch
TensorFlow version (use command below):




print(tensorflow.VERSION)
1.2.1
print(tensorflow.GIT_VERSION)
b'v1.2.0-2149-gf092326'




Python version:
Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
[bazel release 0.5.2]
CUDA/cuDNN version:
n/a
GPU model and memory:
n/a
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel test //tensorflow/python/... --test_verbose_timeout_warnings

Describe the problem
I am troubleshooting my usage of estimators/SVM (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45194171/tensorflow-svm-code-update-to-v1-2), and along the way it seems like svm_test.py isn't executed when running the bazel test command above. I'm a tensorflow newb, so it would be super helpful for me to understand what I'm missing here.
