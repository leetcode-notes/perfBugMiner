Beam Search 4 Translate.py

Hi,
I'm wondering which steps are necessary to move from the greedy decoder currently implemented to an actual beam search decoder. Is this enhancement already in someone's roadmap? If not, could anyone tell me which is the right point in the code where to add this functionality?
Thanks a lot!
Marcello
