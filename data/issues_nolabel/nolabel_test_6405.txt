tf.split_v() is removed in master?

A bit of history:

Until <= 0.12, tf.split() has the following signature:
tf.split(split_dim, num_split, value, name='split')
In commit f803bd7 (since 0.12), a new op split_v() is introduced:
tf.split_v(value, size_splits, split_dim=0, num=None, name="split_v")
In commit a46b6d2 (master), tf.split_v() is finally renamed to tf.split():
tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis=0, num=None, name="split")

Due to these changes, the signature of tf.split() has been changed. AFAIK TensorFlow will having some of breaking changes after 0.12 (after the end of 2016); is this backward-incompatible API change intended?
If so, my suggestion is that tf.split_v(), which has been introduced in 0.12, should not be removed in the newer versions as well. In the current master, tf.split_v is non-existent.
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'split_v'

I am reporthing this (minor) issue because I am frequently switching the tensorflow versions, from r0.12 (stable branch) to master (the breaking? future), and thus I need a way to write a code that is both compatible in those two versions. However, due to the change of tf.split(), it seems that I cannot achieve it at the moment.
Thanks,
