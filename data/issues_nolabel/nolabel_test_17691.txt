Describe the problem
I had a model trained (with multiple days) using tf1.4, and I want to load it in tf1.6.  and the error occurs as below:
File "/Users/iyukun/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2427, in set_shapes_for_outputs

raise ValueError(err.message)
ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 900 and 600 for 'dynamic_seq2seq/decoder/decoder/while/BeamSearchDecoderStep/multi_rnn_cell/cell_1/basic_lstm_cell/MatMul' (op: 'MatMul') with input shapes: [?,900], [600,1200].
Looks like the MatMul op is changed from float16 to float32 in tf 1.5+?  If so,  is there a way to load the model in tf1.5+?
