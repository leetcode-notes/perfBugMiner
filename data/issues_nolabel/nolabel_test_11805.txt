Cannot build Tensorflow: 'GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.1
Python version: 3.6.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.0
GPU model and memory: GTX1080, 8G
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --verbose_failures --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I cannot build Tensorflow from source. I have gcc libraries installed in "/opt/ohpc/pub/compiler/gcc/5.4.0/lib64". But the installer was not able to pick it up. It always tries to use the one in "/usr/lib64". I have set "LDFLAGS" "LD_LIBRARY_PATH", etc. Nothing works.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
$ bazel build --verbose_failures --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
