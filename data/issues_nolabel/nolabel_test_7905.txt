pi_examples: Building label_image shows missing graph.pb.h then graph.pb.h version error

When building the label_image example in pi_examples:
./tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h:12:2: error: #error This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is
./tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h:13:2: error: #error incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers. Please update
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
None, the mentions of graph.pb.h were all for that file simply being missing.
In my case, moving graph.pb.h to the location the compiler expects resulted in the version error message, above.
Also, the issue reports seemed to be pre- TF v.1.0.0, and likely not relevant.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Build tensorflow from source, exactly as at:
https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/blob/master/GUIDE.md
Attempt tp build label_image example, exactly as at:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/
Corrected error caused by missing graph.pb.h by copying graph.pb.h from:
/home/pi/tensorflow/bazel-tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h
to
/home/pi/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/node_def.pb.h
and ran the label_image make again. Error shown below.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
None, not very familiar w/Bazel and TF building yet... after all, the pi_examples are for newbies to get started with and learn TF, right?
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
