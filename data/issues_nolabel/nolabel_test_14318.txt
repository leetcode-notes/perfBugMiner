updated keras backend with missing methods

Hi,
The keras backend in the tensorflow repository is currently missing:
conv3d_transpose
cumprod
cumsum
depthwise_conv2d
identity
local_conv1d
local_conv2d
logsumexp
tile
from the init.py file.
They are present in the _impl.backend package but haven't been brought through via imports in the int.py file.
Regards,
Alex
