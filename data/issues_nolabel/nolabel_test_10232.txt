module 'tensorflow.contrib' has no attribute 'signal'

Previously, I got the signal package merged into contrib: #9236
But now that I recompiled it all after a while, I got this when trying to use it:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib' has no attribute 'signal'
Since all the tests went through, how can it be it can't even be found?
Could I have missed adding yet another reference to the package somewhere?
tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm does work
tf.contrib.signal.frames does not work
