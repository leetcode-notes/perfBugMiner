Wrong Bazel version check when building from source

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version: Python 2.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.10.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.8.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 7.0
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 970, 4GB VRAM
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I am trying to build TensorFLow 1.5 with Bazel 0.10.1 from the Google apt repo (http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt).
The build immediately fails with a misleading error message:
Current Bazel version is 0.10.1, expected at least 0.5.4
because the build script is comparing strings instead of integers of the version numbers.
Backtrace:
$ bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
