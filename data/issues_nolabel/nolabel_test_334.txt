Error: Executing cifar10_train.py on Ubuntu with Cuda

I just went through the cifar10 tensorflow tutorial on my mac. This tutorial aroused my enthusiasm for NN so I set a Ubuntu Server up in order to train in large scale.
However I cant run the cifar10_train.py on my server. I always run into this error:
Path of the tensorflow source code:
~/python/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/

Path of the tensorflow virtualenv installation:
~/tensorflow/

Cmd:
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate #activate virtualenv
python/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_train.py #the raw source code of tensorflow is in ~/python/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow

Error:

I installed tensorflow just like on my mac in a virtualenv and activated it correctly before executing the script.
As by many in other threads suggested I upgraded already six, however I still got the same error.
Update 1
After going the issue threads on github/tensorflow through I noticed this is a bug involving cuda. I added these to my path environment:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64"
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda

I still run into a error, however it has shortened down to the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "cifar10_train.py", line 28, in <module>
import tensorflow.python.platform
ImportError: No module named tensorflow.python.platform

Update 2 As someone suggested, I install protobuf via pip. The Error has once again change for some weird reason:
