Java/JNI , Object Detection: Not big Difference with GPU or CPU? (Insignificant difference) ~300ms with and without GPU

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

binary by instructions https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_java

Install on Linux
Take the following steps to install TensorFlow for Java on Linux or macOS:
1 Download libtensorflow.jar, which is the TensorFlow Java Archive (JAR).
2 Decide whether you will run TensorFlow for Java on CPU(s) only or with the help of GPU(s). To help you decide, read the section entitled "Determine which TensorFlow to install" in one of the following guides:

Installing TensorFlow on Linux

3 Download and extract the appropriate Java Native Interface (JNI) file for your operating system and processor support by running the following shell commands:
TF_TYPE="gpu"
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
mkdir -p ./jni
curl -L 
"https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow_jni-${TF_TYPE}-${OS}-x86_64-1.4.0.tar.gz" |
tar -xz -C ./jni
