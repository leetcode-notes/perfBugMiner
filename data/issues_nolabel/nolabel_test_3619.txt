Steps to reproduce

I compile tf for iOS with the makefile
I follow https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/quantization/index.html to quantize a model which run perfectly in iOS
Replace the frozen model file with the quantized one, iOS throw the Error

F /Users/yjmade/Documents/code/labs/tensorflow/tf_master1/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/camera_object_detect/CameraExampleViewController.mm:436] Couldn't load model: Not found: Op type not registered 'Dequantize'

I think it maybe is the same problem with #3543
