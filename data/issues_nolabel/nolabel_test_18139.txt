Error in restoring the tensorflow model and metagraph while using seq2seq and attention model.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.0.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):No
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8/7
GPU model and memory:GTX 1060X and 6GB
Exact command to reproduce:

I am using seq2seq model with attention mechanism for a chatbot as given in the link, I am able to train the model and save it but when I am trying to restore the model I am getting an error:
Code for loading the model:
with tf.Session() as sess:
        #try:
        saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('/media/saurabh/New Volume/nlp_ucf/project/model/model_0.ckpt.meta')
        saver.restore(sess, '/media/saurabh/New Volume/nlp_ucf/project/model/model_0.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001')

The error I am getting is
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:975] Creating TensorFlow device (/gpu:0) -> (device: 0, name: GeForce GTX 1060, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0)

ValueError: No op named attn_add_fun_f32f32f32 in defined operations.

I am even unable to understand the error. Does anyone have any clue about it? I was able to find one more person with a similar issue on StackOverflow but couldn't understand what exactly is the solution?
