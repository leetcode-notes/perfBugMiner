ImportError: No module named core.framework.graph_pb2

Compiled tensorflow from source, everything works including the eigen value computation example. However, when I try to run the mnist convolutional net example with the command 'python tensorflow/models/image/mnist/convolutional.py' I get the error: ImportError: No module named core.framework.graph_pb2.
