Add gradient tests for `tf.maximum` and `tf.minimum`

Was looking into adding gradient tests for tf.clip_by_value (#13998 (comment))
and then noticed that there is no gradient tests in math_grad_test.py
for tf.maximum and tf.minimum.
Think it makes sense to add a gradient test to cover tf.maximum and tf.minimum
