0.10.0rc0: tf.pack uses the wrong negative axis

When supplied a negative axis, tf.pack() actually operates on (axis - 1). For example, providing axis=-1 operates on the second-to-last axis, not the last axis.
This code illustrates the issue:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#10 tensors with shape 2, 3, 4, 5
x = [tf.convert_to_tensor(np.zeros((2, 3, 4, 5)))] * 10

# pack along last axis explicitly
tf.pack(x, 4).get_shape().as_list() # [2, 3, 4, 5, 10]

# pack along last axis with negative axis, doesn't work
tf.pack(x, -1).get_shape().as_list() # [2, 3, 4, 10, 5]

# this doesn't match the behavior of unpack(), so packing/unpacking 
# along the same negative axis fails
len(tf.unpack(tf.pack(x, axis=-1), axis=-1)) == 10 # False
