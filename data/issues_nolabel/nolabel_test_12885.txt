mmap file

I added a memory mapped file option for the model file.  Since the model files have to be copied out of the apk due to assets directory readonly status and inability to create the FileChannel directly, it is assumed that you have done so to internal storage with the same context that is passed into the overloaded constructor.  Internal storage eliminates problems of SD card not being present or M runtime permissions requests but is also in danger of being full etc.  Expansion files are the only other option, but this requires a download from the play store, which is an extra step.  I therefore did the most simple thing.
