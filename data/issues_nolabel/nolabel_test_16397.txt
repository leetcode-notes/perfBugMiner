Describe the problem
TensorFlow 1.4.X was working well with S3 in my environment. After upgrading to 1.5.0rc1, I found that S3 could not be accessed. "Curl returned error code 6" is reported.
I noticed that AWS SDK had been upgraded from 1.0.90 to 1.3.15 in r1.5 and master branches. Thus, I pulled the master (2e5ff39) and tried to change AWS SDK 1.3.15 into 1.0.90 in tensorflow/workspace.bzl. After this modification, it works well!
I tried with both AWS S3 (with http proxy) and Minio (localhost), and the results are the same. (AWS SDK 1.0.90 is Ok, but 1.3.15 reports error)
I guess there might be some incompatible changes after AWS SDK 1.3.15. Could you please take a look? Thanks! @yongtang
I noticed that AWS SDK required gcc 4.9, but I was using 4.8. Thus, this issue might be related to the old versions of gcc and glib on my server. I will try with some new systems as well.
