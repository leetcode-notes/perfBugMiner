TensorFlow upgrade to 1.0.0 breaking import

On the Mac OS X El Capitan V 10.11.6 using python 2.7.11 with anaconda
when I run this code:
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.9.0-py2-none-any.whl
I get a working version of tensorflow 0.9.0. import tensorflow in python throws no errors.
I type in the command:
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
I get a successful install

and I get a broken import statement in python (.. modify dir names)

Exception: Versioning for this project requires either an sdist tarball, or access to an upstream git repository. It's also possible that there is a mismatch between the package name in setup.cfg and the argument given to pbr.version.VersionInfo. Project name mock was given, but was not able to be found.

when I import again in the same interface, I get a different error which repeats if I do it anymore
