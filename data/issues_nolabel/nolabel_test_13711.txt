--config=mkl leads to libmklml_intel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I compiled passing --config=mkl to bazel, it compiles fine and i get the .whl file, i install it with pip correctly, but when i launch a python session and type : import tensorflow as tf i get:
ImportError: libmklml_intel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Any ideas?
