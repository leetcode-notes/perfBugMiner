Current Bazel version is 0.12.0, expected at least 0.4.2

Problem when building tensorflow from source. I have been following the guides from the tensorflow official website but apparently they are not in sync.
Tried to get the latest Bazel and build it myself , I found out the 0.12.0 was the latest on Bazel github.
Have I written custom code: NO
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version: 1.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: No
GPU model and memory: No
Exact command to reproduce: ./configure
