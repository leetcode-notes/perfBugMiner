why is the tensor value of the dimension resolved when reading tfrecord files is twice as much as is required to rescontruct the dimension？

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow1.4
Python version: Python 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): --
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): --
CUDA/cuDNN version: --
GPU model and memory:Tesla K80
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
