Remove compiler warnings on CHECK_* and DCHECK_* macros.

This removes lots of simple compiler warnings on 'signed' and 'unsigned'
comparisons on CHECK_* and DCHECK_* macros (reported in #128).
In most cases, static_cast<> is used to remove the warnings.
This does not fix 3rd-party(stream_executor/eigen/protobuf)-related warnings and
also does not change any function signatures.
