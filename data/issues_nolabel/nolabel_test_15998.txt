tensorflow input/output tensor reshape c++

currently , I am working on loading and testing a tensorflow model on android using c++, and the trained model is a full convolutional model, so the input need to be dynamically reshaped according to input image size.
I can make this done easily using python. but when turn to c++ , I can hardly find much examples and experience on this.
the trained model is converted to *.pb file , and the input and output tensor shape has been specified before conversion in python. and now I want to reshape the input and output in c++ before using the model.
