Batch + dynamic_pad + squeeze + one_hot + dynamic_rnn throws shape error

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.1.0-rc2-259-g34c738c
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Python version: 3.5.2
Exact command to reproduce: python ./bug.py

Describe the problem
A certain combination of ops causes tf.nn.dynamic_rnn to throw a ValueError: Input size (depth of inputs) must be accessible via shape inference, but saw value None. during compilation of the graph. I will attach the script to reproduce the issue and the required tfrecords file.
The problem seems to be a combination of batching with dynamic_pad enabled, and squeeze + one_hot. I use squeeze + one_hot because SequenceExample gives me a [examples x time_steps x 1] tensor, and one_hot adds another dimension, so I first need to get rid of the last dimension to get a [examples x time_steps x 3] one-hot encoded tensor.
A few observations:

When excluding availability_one_hot from the lstm_inputs concat, the script runs ok.
When commenting out the dynamic_rnn op and evaluating print(sess.run(tf.shape(lstm_inputs))) instead, the output is [2 8 4], which is the correct shape (1 normal feature + 3 from the one-hot encoding = 4 features)`.
I tried to recreate the batch with a tf.constant() literal, but using that the graph worked fine, so the batching with dynamic padding is needed to reproduce the issue.
