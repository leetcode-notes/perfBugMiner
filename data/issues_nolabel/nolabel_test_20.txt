CUDA 7.5 fails with pip install and docker (Ubuntu 14.04)

Installing via:
# For GPU-enabled version (only install this version if you have the CUDA sdk installed)
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Tried to run the alexnet_benchmark.py and it's looking for CUDA 7.0 specifically.
I have CUDA 7.5 on my machine.
Full stack:

ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Tried the docker install, but the docker image is configured for a particular NVIDIA driver version, and doesn't work with others. (this is a known issue: docker driver version and system driver version must exactly match)
