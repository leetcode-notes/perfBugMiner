Issue running compile_ios_tensorflow.sh?

On running compile_ios_tensorflow.sh, I am facing the below issue.
sh compile_ios_tensorflow.sh
sed: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen-latest/eigen/src/Core/arch/NEON/Complex.h: No such file or directory
sed: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen-latest/eigen/src/Core/arch/NEON/Complex.h: No such file or directory
sed: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen-latest/eigen/src/Core/arch/NEON/Complex.h: No such file or directory
make: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile'.  Stop.
make: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile'.  Stop.

armv7 compilation failed.
because of this I am unable to proceed with iOS example, cos of missing libtensorflow.a
ld: file not found: /Users/jsahil/projects/tensorflow/tensorflow-master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/camera/../../makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a

Please let me know, if I am missing something or this is an issue with the script. Thanks
