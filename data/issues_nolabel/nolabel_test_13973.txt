import error :cudnnConvolutionBiasActivationForward because tensorflow cpu and tensorflow gpu, both were installed

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

I installed tensorflow cpu and tensorflow gpu by mistake .I uninstalled both the versions after  realising my mistake .I then got afresh install with tensorflow gpu.Then i get an import error as below
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so: undefined symbol: cudnnConvolutionBiasActivationForward
I tried restarting and force reinstall.but both did not work.I also tried with a virtual environment and failed.
When i downgraded to tensorflow-gpu-1_2-1 it works.However i need 1.3
