Make sparse_to_dense differentiable by wrapping scatter_nd_add.

Make sparse_to_dense a wrapper of scatter_nd_add, as the two have very similar functionality and the latter is differentiable while the former is not. Ran into this because there apparently is no warning when trying to differentiate not differentiable ops.

If this has potential to be merged and further changes are required, I am happy to work on those.
edit: Misleading commit message, wrapping scatter_nd_add in order to allow a default value.
