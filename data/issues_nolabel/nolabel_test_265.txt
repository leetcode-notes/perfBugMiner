Trouble running a tutorial file

Hi,
I'm trying to run all tutorials, and I'm stuck with fully_connected_feed.py as it produced following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "fully_connected_feed.py", line 15, in 
import tensorflow.python.platform
File "/home/pilotwarela0/Development/tensorflow/tensorflow/init.py", line 4, in 
from tensorflow.python import *
File "/home/pilotwarela0/Development/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/init.py", line 15, in 
from tensorflow.core.framework.graph_pb2 import *
ImportError: No module named core.framework.graph_pb2
I managed to track down the location of module:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/core/framework/
So, added this path to PYTHONPATH with this:
PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/"
export PYTHONPATH
It didn't work. So, I tried this solution by adding the lines:
import sys
sys.path.append("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/")
in ~/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/platform/init.py
None of these solution worked out for me. What am I doing wrong here? Could you please suggest a correct way to solve this problem?
