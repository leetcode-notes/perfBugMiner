Documentation for Adding New Hardware

Adding documentation about the internals of TensorFlow.
The motivation is to instruct a user on how to add new hardware to TensorFlow. It is a work in progress as there is little documentation on the subject so I am doing everything by trial and error.
Feedback is appreciated as this is a work in progress.
My company is KnuEdge and they signed the CLA. The person who actually signed is named Dave Eames.
