Strange input image in android demo

I'm running android camera-based demo application. When I change SAVE_PREVIEW_BITMAP in TensorflowImageListener.java into true, I can save croppedBitmap. However, this saved image is all green with little detail of image.

When the camera is connected, YUV_420_888 format is used, Then plane #0 is always Y, plane #1 is always U (Cb), and plane #2 is always V (Cr).
imageReader =
            ImageReader.newInstance(
                largest.getWidth(), largest.getHeight(), ImageFormat.YUV_420_888, /*maxImages*/ 2);

However in TensorflowImageListener.java only 0, 2 planes are used.
final int[] planeOrder = {0, 2};
for (int i = 0; i < planeOrder.length; ++i) {
  final Plane plane = planes[planeOrder[i]];
  final ByteBuffer buffer = plane.getBuffer();
  buffer.rewind();
  final int readAmount = buffer.remaining();
  buffer.get(yuvBytes, position, readAmount);
  position += readAmount;
}

By the way I'm using LG G2 and Android version is 5.0.1
