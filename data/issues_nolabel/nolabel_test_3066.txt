Tensorboard webpage breaking on current build

Tensorboard GUI is breaking on the latest build after commit 861644c.
On Chrome, only a blue header with buttons appears.
On Firefox, large button icons appear (unclickable).
The nightly build from about a week ago works fine with the orange header and using same event files.
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 x64
