[Java] Bulk data transfer for Tensor class

Closes #6576
Introduces bulk data-access pattern to Tensor, with tests.

Tensor::create(DataType dt, long[] shape, Buffer data) method
Tensor::getDataByteSize() method
Tensor::readData(Buffer data) method

Details:

rename allocate to allocateNDArray since it is designed for the
NDarray scenario.
introduce a native allocate method that accepts the data size in
bytes, rather than computing the size with shape information (which
isnâ€™t always sufficient, e.g. TF_STRING).
introduce a private buffer accessor to access the TF data as a
direct ByteBuffer.
implement create and readData methods to read and write data
using a variety of Buffer variants.   Supports typed buffers and
direct buffers.
