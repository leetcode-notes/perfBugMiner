Estimators can't restore from their saved configuration

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A: no verbatim example from TensorFlow on restoring from and export_savedmodel().
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Window 10x64; Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

# Create and train some classifier ....
c = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(hidden_units = [10,10], feature_columns=my_feature_columns)
# ... do some training
# We'll assume here that I'm using Pandas, and just have floats
specDict = {}
for col in list(train_x.columns):
    specDict[col] = tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32)
psirf = tf.estimator.export.build_parsing_serving_input_receiver_fn(specDict, 100)
pathOut = c.export_savedmodel("./trainedModels/", psirf)
# I'll write pathOut to a file ...
In a new instance:
# We recreate my cols, and pull pathOut from the file it was written to
c = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(hidden_units = [10,10], feature_columns=my_feature_columns, model_dir = pathOut)
# Using the canned `eval_input_fn` from the iris_data.py example
# dataDict is the source data
predictions = c.predict(input_fn=eval_input_fn(dataDict, None))
for predDict in predictions:
    # raises "ValueError: Could not find trained model in model_dir: pathOut"
    print(predDict)

Describe the problem
The estimator only looks for the latest checkpoint, and ignores any exports that might have been created from its own export_savedmodel function
Because of https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py#L644-L652 , seems like tf.saved_model.loader.load should also be checked
