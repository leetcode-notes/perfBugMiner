Slim VGG losses increase gradually with default training configuration

Hi, when I try to train imagenet with slim vgg network with default configuration,
The loss increases gradually from ~0.1 to over 10000.
I am not even able to debug this issue because, all tensors losses are encapsulated inside slim.
Is there any way to debug this issue?
