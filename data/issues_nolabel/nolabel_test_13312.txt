Support TensorArray in BeamSearchDecoder state.

#13208 attempted to fix #13154 by representing the alignment_history field with a Tensor instead of a TensorArray. However, @ebrevdo pointed out that this approach led to a quadratic time and space overhead.
This PR fixes the issue by directly adding the support for TensorArray in the BeamSearchDecoder state as proposed by @ebrevdo.
@ebrevdo Let me know what you think of this implementation. Thanks!
