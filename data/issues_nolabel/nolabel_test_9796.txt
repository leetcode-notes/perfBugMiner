doing inference using batch normalization with only one example

I build my model using batch normalization with tf.layers.batch_normalization . But when i am doing inference using saved model, I have to set the parameter training=True  in tf.layers.batch_normalization to make it work. Does it should be training=False?  Moreover, I have to feed a batch of test examples to make it work. It fails when fed with only one example.
So what is the right way to use tf.layers.batch_normalization?
