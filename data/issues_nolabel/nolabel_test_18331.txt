Fix incorrect data type registration of reduce_min/reduce_max in math_ops.cc

The ops tf.reduce_min/reduce_max should only support real number types. However, numbertype was incorrect used in math_ops.cc. (The kernel parts in reduction_ops_min.cc and reduction_ops_max.cc use TF_CALL_REAL_NUMBER_TYPES correctly).
This fix fixes the issue by replacing numbertype to realnumbertype in math_ops.cc.
