Rust API

TensorFlow should have a Rust interface.
Original e-mail:
I'd like to write Rust bindings for TensorFlow, and I had a few questions.  First of all, is anyone already working on this, and if so, can I lend a hand?  If not, is this something the TensorFlow team would be interested in?  I assume that the TensorFlow team would not be willing to commit right now to supporting Rust, so I thought a separate open source project (with the option to fold into the main project later) would be the way to go.
