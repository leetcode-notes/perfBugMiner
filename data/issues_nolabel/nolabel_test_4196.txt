Error when running two simultaneous sessions

Can I run two simultaneous sessions?
I start with: "with tf.Graph().as_default(), tf.Session() as sess:"
When I run my script alone, the result is OK, but when I run 2 instances the result is completely wrong or throw some errors like:
Error max() arg is an empty sequence
I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:924] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_init.cc:102] Found device 0 with properties:

pciBusID 0000:01:00.0
Total memory: 1.95GiB
Free memory: 1.47GiB
(and also)
float division by zero
Can I do something in my code do avoid these errors?
Maybe check if TF is already running and hold it?
Than you very much.
