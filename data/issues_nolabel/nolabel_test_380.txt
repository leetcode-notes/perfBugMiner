wishlist: provide alternative build system

The memory consumption for bootstraping bazel is very huge, according to my observation.
And I really have trouble building bazel on my machine because lacking of enough memory.
So could you please provide an alternative (traditional) build system (e.g. make, cmake) or setup.py,
for users who insist on building software from source by themselves.
Thanks.
