tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError

I have run a tensorflow code, which always give following errors:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: The node 'div_1' has inputs from different frames. The input 'while/Mean_1' is in frame 'while/while/'. The input 'div_1/y' is in frame ''.
And I have searched for a long time, but find no proper solutions. I really wonder that anyone could give me some advice.
