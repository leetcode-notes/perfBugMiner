ImportError for graph_util from tensorflow.python.framework

Importing graph_util from tensorflow.python.framework fails with an ImportError.
I discovered this while I was trying to go through the TensorFlow for Poets Codelab, an the the re-training failed.
I can reproduce the same error in my Python shell. I am able to verify that TensorFlow is installed correctly by importing tensorflow, tensor_shape from tensorflow.python.framework, and gfile from tensorflow.python.platform (as in the retraining script); but trying to import graph_util results in the same ImportError:
>>> import tensorflow
# Success
>>> from tensorflow.python.framework import tensor_shape
# Success
>>> from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile
# Success
>>> from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name graph_util

I have also posted this as a question on Stack Overflow, and haven't received any answers so far. I am not sure if this is a bug or a configuration problem etc. Feels like a bug, since I can import tensor_shape from tensorflow.python.framework no problem.
Environment info
Operating System: OS X El Capitan (v10.11.5)
Python: v2.7.11 via Homebrew
TensorFlow 0.9.0 installed from binary pip package for Mac OS X, CPU only, Python 2.7 (TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.9.0-py2-none-any.whl).
Steps to reproduce
In Python shell:
>>> from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name graph_util

What have I tried?

Looked to see if the file graph_util is there inside tensorflow/python/framework. It is.
Looked to see if the current source code I am examining has undergone any changes since v0.9.0 that would fix this issue that appears in the release that I am using. It doesn't appear so to me.
