I can't run tensorflow at an atom.

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

I'm using window 10 and ANAconda.
I downloaded it using prompt.
I can use it at the cmd, however, I can't using it at the atom.
I also can't code complex program like linear regression.
I only can code easy thing hello tensorflow using prompt.
How can I solve this problem?
Please help me.
I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, however, it doesn't work.
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello,Tensorflow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))
