AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'TF_NewStatus

In the latest sources the issue: #3388 is fixed in the thensorflow/python/client/session.py, But I now receive the following error instead:
Exception ignored in: <bound method BaseSession.__del__ of <tensorflow.python.client.session.Session object at 0x7fb2e08cee48>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "$HOME/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 595, in __del__
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'TF_NewStatus'


I compiled the model manually using the latest version sources and using Bazel 0.4.5. The same seems to be true as with the issue 3388: The error is not always popping up and the run seems to have ended normally. However, now and then to above error message is displayed.
