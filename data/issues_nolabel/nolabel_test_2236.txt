Can't separate by sentences when running word2vec model?

In gensim word2vec, the input can be a list of sentences. However, in tensorflow word2vec, the input is a list of words (concatenate sentences together). Can you add the feature to separate by sentences to word2vec?
I am using the following code: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.8/tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec.py
