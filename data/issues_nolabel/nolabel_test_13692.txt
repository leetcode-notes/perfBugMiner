TensorFlow 1.3.0 GPU for Windows doesn't work for 2 NVIDIA P4s

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7 (factory production machine)


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow-gpu
tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl


TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0


Python version:  3.5


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version: Cuda release 8.0, V8.0.60.  cuDNN 6.


GPU model and memory:  2 NVIDIA Tesla P4s (same as specs)


Exact command to reproduce: https://github.com/tkuanlun350/Tensorflow-SegNet


Describe the problem
We're currently evaluating Tensorflow as a possible replacement for Caffe but we seem to have run into a problem with running multiple P4s on a production system.
Our production systems are offline so I had to install a Python wheel of the GPU version TF framework which works fine until I try to use 2 GPUs for training where I get the error message:
2017-10-05 13:53:42.989423: I C:\tf_jenkins\home\workspace\rel-win\M\windows-gpu\PY\35\tensorflow\core\common_runtime\gpu\gpu_device.cc:847] Peer access not supported between device ordinals 1 and 0
P4s are installed and working correctly.  I don't understand why peer-to-peer GPU access is required for using GPUs.  We can run multiple GPUs on our Caffe implementation.
