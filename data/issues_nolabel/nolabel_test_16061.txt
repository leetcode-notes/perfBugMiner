OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory on deep Q learning model

I was having fun with the Deep Q learning model, which came from https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/DQN. Then after 750 episodes this error popped up.







I was running this code on Ubuntu 14.04 with a 8G graphic card(GTX 1070). I have had libav-tools installed before I ran the code.
I will try to reduce the batch size to see whether similar error will pop up again.
Please help me solve this problem.
