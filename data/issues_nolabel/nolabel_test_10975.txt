The issue template has an incorrect link.

Ironically, I think the issue template is wrong. I presume that point 3 below is meant to point to the tensorboard repo issue tracker https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues but as you can see it just points back to the main repo issue tracker! Judging by the activity on that issue tracker perhaps this is on purpose but I doubt it!
3. It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues).

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go >>> here. <<<
