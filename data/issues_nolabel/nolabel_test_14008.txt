tf.python.keras can't import np_utils

Typically i'm able to replace any "from keras.X import Y" with "from tensorflow.python.keras.X import Y"
This works with most things, but it does not translates to keras.utils. I can run:
from keras.utils import np_utils
But the following fails:
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils import np_utils
The workaround is just to use:
from tensorflow.python.keras._impl.keras.utils import np_utils
Unsure if this is intended or not. I guess I'd consider this either a bug fix or a feature request.
