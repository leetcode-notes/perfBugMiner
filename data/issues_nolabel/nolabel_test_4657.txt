arg_scope overwrite fails for positional arguments

The code
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
with slim.arg_scope([slim.fully_connected], num_outputs=20):
    y = slim.fully_connected(x, 30)

raises
TypeError: fully_connected() got multiple values for argument 'num_outputs'

There is an easy workaround, namely changing 30 to num_outputs=30 seems to work fine.  I'm not sure if this is easy to fix or was even intended to work.
