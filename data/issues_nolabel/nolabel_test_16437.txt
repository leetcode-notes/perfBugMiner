Update README.md

-png, --sample_index options are not available in google-perftools (2.4-0ubuntu5.16.04.1).
Also, since Ubuntu 16.04 wrongly recommends to install pprof from 'tau' package

The program 'pprof' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install tau

the typical user command should probably be
google-pprof --pdf --nodecount=100 <filename>
