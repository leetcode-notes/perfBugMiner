Moving data from CPU to GPU is slow

I have noticed that when moving MNIST data from the CPU to the GPU, there is a significant time lag when using TensorFlow in comparison to Theano. Specifically, we have noticed this problem in the context of feed_dict, which moves information from the CPU to the GPU when running minibatches. I am using python 2.7. Our current solution to this problem is to move all of the data directly to the GPU at the beginning of the program, which is of course not sustainable unless one has a significant amount of space on their GPU.
When we time 25000 minibatches of size 100 each, TensorFlow is approximately four times as slow as Theano. I have attached both files, and the time difference is evident in the final output.
