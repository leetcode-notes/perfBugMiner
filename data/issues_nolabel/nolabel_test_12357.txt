tf.contrib.slim evaluation: outdated documentation

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d7fa7ae8ac15118393b6a549eb98ec9ca23497c0/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/evaluation.py
The documentation to this, in the first section (Evaluating metrics) uses this code to do the evaluation of the metrics directly (within an existing session, without having to reference a specific checkpoint):
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    metric_values = slim.evaluation(
        sess,
        num_evals=1,
        inital_op=initial_op,
        eval_op=names_to_updates.values(),
        final_op=name_to_values.values())

This code, however, does not work anymore, as the function slim.evaluation doesn't exist now.
what would now be the preferred way to do this?
