Fix CMake config if used as a subproject

With this fix we don't assume that the tensorflow project is the build
root. Instead CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR/CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR is used
instead of just CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/CMAKE_BINARY_DIR, which now builds
successfully, if it is built inside another, larger project.
