Raspberry example DecodeJpeg issue with Inception Retraining model

Environment info
Operating System: raspbian
Steps to reproduce

1.Follow the contrib/makefile/README to install the tensorflow raspbian core lib
2.Run the pi example, both successfully
3.Create inception model generally with the Tensorflow For Poets in Ubuntu 16.04
4.Retrain the model and get 'retrained_graph.pb' and 'retrained_labels.txt'
5.Run the pi example with those two files by

tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/label_image/gen/bin/label_image --image=xxx.jpg --graph=retrained_graph.pb --labels=retrained_labels.txt
and get error log

#2883 And I have also read your blog ‘tensorflow for mobile poets’ ... Is raspberry pi a mobile device? cuz when I run the command tensorflow/python/tools:optimize_for_inference in the file made by contrib/makefile/README , it suggested that no such file or dictionery..
Any comment on what I do wrong.
many thanks
