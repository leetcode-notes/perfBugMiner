tf.contrib.xprof not supported on Windows

opts = tf.contrib.tfprof.model_analyzer.TRAINABLE_VARS_PARAMS_STAT_OPTIONS
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.tfprof' has no attribute 'model_analyzer'
I have tensorflow version 1.2 and have made all the other transitioning changes and the above error was thrown later.
Has the contrib support been resolved for Windows? Please help
