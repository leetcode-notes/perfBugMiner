[skflow] Added verbosity support to Validation monitor

Aim of this diff is adding verbosity switch to Validation monitor class,
whcih previosly had none (It was automatically set to level 1).
I've tested locally on my machine, and works as expected:
skflow.monitors.ValidationMonitor
regressor = skflow.TensorFlowDNNRegressor(hidden_units=[10, 10],
    steps=5000, learning_rate=0.1, batch_size=1,
                                          verbose=0)

regressor.fit(X_t, Y_t, monitor=skflow.monitors.ValidationMonitor(X_cv, Y_cv, verbose=0))

Previous code is a bit edited example ones.
