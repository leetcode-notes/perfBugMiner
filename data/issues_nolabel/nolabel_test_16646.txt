can tf.estimator.Estimator's  parameters be modified by hand?

TF's  high level API  is very convenient to defined a new model.
However, many DNN Machine Learning task has to reuse some old model's parameter to fill a new model and then  fine-tune it in new tasks.
I have read the tf.estimator.Estimator'API  carefully, but cann't find any API to set It's parameters. Hope  TF developer  add this function to the high level API.
Thank very much!
