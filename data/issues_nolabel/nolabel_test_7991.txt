{Base,LocalCLI}DebugWrapperSession and SessionInterface don't have 'as_default'.

I tried to use tfdbg to hunt those Infs, and it complained LocalCLIDebugWrapperSession  was lacking as_default, which I use to set the default session for each thread. Neither its parent class BaseDebugWrapperSession or the interface SessionInterface it implements seem to have it. I thought it was supposed to be a drop-in replacement, is this part of the design?
