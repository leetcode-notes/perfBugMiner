Uninstall Bazel

Hi!
I ran into an error while running code very similar to the RNN tutorial.
I believe the issue was the exact problem that was apparently fixed now. So I wanted to uninstall my version of Tensorflow and install it from source code in order to get the latest updates.
But (!) after installing Bazel and downloading the tensorflow repo, I ran into an error while compiling. A file, "transpose_op_gpu.cu.d" was said to be missing and the compilation could not continue. Strange.
So then I wanted to install tensorflow again "normally" using pip. That seems to have worked, but when I try to import tensorflow in python it just says
Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.

So my question is: How do I uninstall Bazel!?
