Tensor board installing issue with docker

Hi I'm a new tensor flow installer~
I do not have any experienced with docker or tensor flow and i followed this web-cite
http://www.netinstructions.com/how-to-install-and-run-tensorflow-on-a-windows-pc/
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#requirements

[this screen stopped after showing this image]

[I do not know what they are doing in actual cmd line but it does not work]
Those are the stops I got stock.  can anyone help?
