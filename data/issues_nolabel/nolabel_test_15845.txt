Support RNNs and LSTMs

Feature Request for TF Lite - support for the following:
td_split
tf_pad (Padding is something that an RNN needs de-facto unless tensorflow RNNs accept lists of variously shaped tensors.)
tf_gather
tf_slice
LSTM Cells
Dynamic RNNs
Are there alternatives to the above in TF Lite?
