Steps to reproduce

Build TensorFlow without uncommenting the Android SDK and NDK parts successfully.
We can

import tensorflow 

in python environment after step 1 and following installation steps.
4. Download SDK and NDK from what https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/README.md suggested.
3. Uncomment the Android SDK and NDK repository in WORKSPACE and change the path.
4. Rebuild using
$ bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

the console returns the error,
ERROR: .../tensorflow/WORKSPACE:10:1: no such package '@androidndk//': Could not read RELEASE.TXT in Android NDK: /private/var/tmp/.../49fff0428.../external/androidndk/ndk/RELEASE.TXT (No such file or directory) and referenced by '//external:android/crosstool'.
What have you tried?

Commenting NDK repository and leave the SDK in TensorFlow WORKSPACE, build using

$ bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

passed and without error.
2.Finding that Downloaded NDK and NDK in /private/var/tmp/.../49fff0428.../external/androidndk/ndk are the same. And there are no RELEASE.TXT in in directory.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
ERROR: .../tensorflow/WORKSPACE:10:1: no such package '@androidndk//': Could not read RELEASE.TXT in Android NDK: /private/var/tmp/.../49fff0428.../external/androidndk/ndk/RELEASE.TXT (No such file or directory) and referenced by '//external:android/crosstool'.
Is this error due to the codes or my building processes?
