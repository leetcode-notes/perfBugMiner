`tf.zeros_like()` and `tf.ones_like()` do not preserve partial shape information

For example:
>>> p = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 4])
>>> z = tf.zeros_like(p)
>>> z.get_shape()
TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(None)])
This happens because ConstantValue(shape(p)) can't be evaluated completely. We should set the shape of the returned tensor.
