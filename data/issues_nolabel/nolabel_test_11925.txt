Update tf.nn.max_pool docs for ksize/strides == 4

Update tf.nn.max_pool docs for ksize/strides == 4, instead of '>= 4' in the existing docs.
As both max_pool and avg_pool are wrapped in the python code, this fix only changes the docstring in tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py.
This fix fixes #10729.
Note: I also tried using := syntax, as was suggested in #10729 (comment) However, it seems that the := only works with Input, not with Attr.
