Why my tensorflow-gpu runs only on cpu? Ubuntu

My tensorflow-gpu runs only on cpu, how to fix it?
I've already tried to set
CUDA_DEVICE_VISIBLE=all my gpus  But it didn't work.
Then I tried to use this code:
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
The output is following:
Device mapping: no known devices.
2017-08-18 16:44:44.654177: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc:300] Device mapping:
Then nothing. It doesn't output the map.
I've also tried to install it with virtualenv and run the program in virtualenv or reinstall, still not working.
Why is this happening? How can I fix it?
