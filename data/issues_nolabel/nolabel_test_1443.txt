Hard-coded gcc path

When compiling with GPU support, the compiler path is set in the file
//third_party/gpus/crosstool/crosstool_wrapper_is_not_gcc on line 47 to 50:
CPU_COMPILER = ('/usr/bin/gcc')
etc

which can result in using an old version on e.g. clusters where several compilers might be installed under a path such as
/appl/gcc/5.3.0/bin/gcc
It would be nice to be able to configure the compiler path.
Edit: This overlaps with the hard coded paths in other parts of Bazel, see for example bazelbuild/bazel#760
