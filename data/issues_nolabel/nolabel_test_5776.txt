Unknown events logged while profiling TensorFlow code using Timeline API

I am seeing Unknown events being logged in the Trace logs using APIs from Timeline.py module. Is this a known issue and any ideas on how this could be fixed? I could not find any references to this issue on GITHUB or StackOverFlow.
Here is couple of examples of "Unknown" events:
   {
        "name": "MEMCPYHtoD",
        "ph": "X",
        "ts": 19926542594074346,
        "cat": "Op",
        "args": {
            "name": "unknown",
            "op": "MEMCPYHtoD"
        },
        "pid": 715,
        "tid": 0,
        "dur": 12535
    },

    {
        "tid": 0,
        "ph": "X",
        "name": "unknown",
        "pid": 63,
        "cat": "Op",
        "args": {
            "op": "unknown",
            "name": "unknown"
        },
        "ts": 19926135764459654,
        "dur": 1147
    },
