NotImplementedError for learn.TensorFlowEstimator.restore

I had saved a model using tensorflow.contrib.learn and am currently trying to restore it. However, I am getting a NotImplementedError.

I realized that this is indeed not implemented in the latest commit.
Until this is implemented, are there any workarounds? I tried pickling the model but was not able to do so, as it is a Module object.
