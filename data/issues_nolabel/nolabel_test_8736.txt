Fallback to legacy camera API for problematic devices in android demo app

Fix #8550
The camera 2 API is problematic in some devices.  Similar problem is also dicussed in #7464 .  One of the problem is shown here on a LG G4c device:

A space inversion is taken (left-right mirrored), and color turns green (which is reported also here https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81984).  It effectively makes all 3 demo app not working or crashes.
This PR attempts to take legacy camera API as fallback, in case INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL is lower than FULL.  It is mostly a copy of the implementation here.  Here is the working demo if fallback is taken:

I would like to mention that I have no previous experience with the API, so the implementation may not be optimal.  Also please check if the demo still works on Android6+ devices because I only have 2 android5 for testing.  Please also notice that the "TF Detect" demo does not show red box on preview image, for which I cannot find out the cause.
