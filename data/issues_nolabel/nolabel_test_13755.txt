Allow num parameter in tf.linspace to be int64.

According to the API, tf.linspace is defined for num int32 or int64.
However the C++ kernel only allows int32, even though the op in core/ops/math_ops permits int64 too.
So I slightly changed the kernel to allow int64 too. I also added tests for RangeOp and LinSpaceOp.
The following code shows the issue:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device("/cpu:0"):
    step = tf.constant(1, tf.int64)
    x = tf.linspace(10.0, 12.0, step)

with tf.Session() as sess:
   x_np = sess.run(x)
   print(x_np)
