Fix to allow compilation for Android API 19

This is a (very) small change to allow compiling TensorFlow for Android API 19. Without this change, you get tensorflow/core/platform/posix/net.cc:44:51: error: 'errno' was not declared in this scope when compiling the example Android project with the WORKSPACE android_ndk_repository parameter api_level set to 19. This change resolves that error and allows compilation for this target.
