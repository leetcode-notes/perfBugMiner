model_with_buckets in seq2seq.py

Hi all,
The online version of https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L873
def model_with_buckets(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, targets, weights,
                       buckets, seq2seq, softmax_loss_function=None,
                       per_example_loss=False, name=None):

is different with the one installed from tensorflow-0.6.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
def model_with_buckets(encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, targets, weights,
                       buckets, num_decoder_symbols, seq2seq,
                       softmax_loss_function=None, name=None):

(extra num_decoder_symbols parameter) which caused
TypeError: model_with_buckets() takes at least 7 arguments (7 given) 

when running https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/translate/seq2seq_model.py#L133.
Which one should I use?
Thanks,
