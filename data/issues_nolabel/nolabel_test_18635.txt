Strange result of float division

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary

Describe the problem
The below Numpy and TensorFlow codelets produce different results, while I suppose they should be the same.
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

x = np.array([247.], dtype=np.float32)
y = x / 255.
print('{:12.10f}'.format(y[0]))
# 0.9686274529

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = a / 255.
with tf.Session() as sess:
    _b = sess.run(b, feed_dict={a: x})
print('{:12.10f}'.format(_b[0]))
# 0.9686275125
Running on CPU gives the same issue.
However, if I use a = tf.constant(x, dtype=tf.float32) instead of tf.placeholder, the result seems correct.
Is this an issue about tf.placeholder or something else? Does this affect other operations?
