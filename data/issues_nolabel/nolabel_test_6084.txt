Confused by the bottle_neck name in retrain tutorial and the inception-v3 model definition

Inception-v3 model definition link: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/slim/inception_model.py
The 'retrain.py' tutorial link: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py
In the retrain.py, I find the bottle_neck name of inception3 model is 'pool_3/_reshape:0' (line 95), but in the inception model definition file i can not find definition of 'pool3'.
Also I load the file 'http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz', and get the bottle_neck tensor by using name 'pool_3:0'. And it is a 4 dimension tensor instead of 2.
What is the real name of bottle_neck tensor? Why can not find the bottle_name in model definition python file?
