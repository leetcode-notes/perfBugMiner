Batchnorm errors in "successful" Windows builds

Current system configuration:
Windows 10 64 bit, intel i7-7700HQ latest microcode, Nvidia 1050 4GB.
Driver: 384.94
Python used: Anaconda 4.4.0 Python 3.6.2 and 3.5.3
CUDA/cuDNN: 8.0.61/5.1 or 8.0.61.2/6.0
swigwin 3.0.12
Built 1.2.1 from source using VS 2015 Update 3, CMake 3.9.0 or 3.9.0 RC5, swigwin 3.0.12.
Code modifications: in builds with both cuDNN and AVX enabled, the code was modified accord to this comment
Issue description: In certain conditions "successful" builds of tensorflow with GPU support, results in broken batchnorm functionality. An example error:


InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): indices[1] is out of range
[[Node: gradients/batch_normalization/moments/Mean_1_grad/DynamicStitch = DynamicStitch[N=2, T=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"](gradients/batch_normalization/moments/Mean_1_grad/range, gradients/batch_normalization/moments/Mean_1_grad/mod, gradients/batch_normalization/moments/Mean_1_grad/Shape, gradients/batch_normalization/moments/Mean_1_grad/Fill)]]

This error was encountered in a variety of different builds. But it was most surprising when it occurred in an unmodified python 3.6 gpu build. Files and configuration can be found here.
