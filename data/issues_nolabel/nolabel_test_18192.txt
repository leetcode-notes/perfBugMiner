Generate Java ops wrappers

This pull request generates Java wrappers for TensorFlow operations. Generated source files are compiled with the main Java source code into the libtensorflow.jar file. The process is done in two steps:
1- The op proto definition is parsed, with its api proto definitions if any, by the op_parser.
2- The parsed information is used to generated a Java wrapper class by the op_generator.
It is important to do this in two steps (instead of writing the source code as we parse) because any aspect found in the proto definition can affect the very beginning of the op class.
