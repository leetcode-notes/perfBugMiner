How to apply dropout for getting prediction from the last layer of a trained model?

I have used transfer learning to retrain/fine-tune Inception-V3 model for image classification on my own data in Tensorflow. However, when I test the image classification after training, I get the following error:

"Invalid argument: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'final_layer/dropout/Placeholder' with dtype float"

I am using the following code for getting the predictions from the final layer:
softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_layer/final_result/Softmax:0') predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data})
I guess the error is caused by not applying the dropout placeholder in the second statement, as the training was performed with dropout layer. How do I add a dropout placeholder here?
