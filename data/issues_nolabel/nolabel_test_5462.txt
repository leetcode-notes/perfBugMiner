local k8s cluster dist_test broken, use kubernetes/minikube instead
As of commit 21a7ae0, the dockerfile for setting up a local cluster for dist_test is broken.  This dockerfile imports start_local_k8s_service.sh and other scripts that were deleted with this merge.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/dist_test/local/Dockerfile#L18
$ docker build .
...
Step 9 : ADD start_local_k8s_cluster.sh /var/k8s/start_local_k8s_cluster.sh
lstat start_local_k8s_cluster.sh: no such file or directory
...

Instead of this dockerfile, this local cluster setup should be switched over to Minikube, the officially supported method for non-k8s-development local clusters.

As a maintainer for minikube, I would happily create a PR with instructions and a tutorial on how to run dist_test locally.  If this sounds good to you, please assign this issue to me.
