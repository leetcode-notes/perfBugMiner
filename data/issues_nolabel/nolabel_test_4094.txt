Queue operation in conditional execution context fails with "operation has been marked as not fetchable"

Hey TensorFlow Community,
a while ago I wrote some code for doing gradient descent in a distributed environment. I adapted code from tensorflow/tensorflow/python/training/sync_replicas_optimizer.py and wrote my own apply_gradients method. Crucially, I included a conditional op, that either performed (distributed, synchronised) gradient descent or returned the apply_gradients op from the original optimizer.
This code worked well when I used it with TensorFlow 0.8, but it broke with 0.9 and is still broken in my current installation from source (see below). The QueueRunner that is responsible for the synchronization op between the workers now fails with the error message "operation has been marked as not fetchable".
A bit of searching in the execution stack led me to the lines
if self._control_flow_context is not None:
self._control_flow_context.AddOp(self)
in tensorflow/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py
from which I take that the error comes from the fact that the queue operations are placed inside the conditional execution context.
Out of curiosity: What is the idea behind "fetchable" ops - and why should enqueuing and dequeueing be "dangerous to fetch"?
Any help would be appreciated!
