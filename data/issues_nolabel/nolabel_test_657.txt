MemoryError - Convolutional.py

I followed the pip install of TensorFlow and when trying the "Test your installation" I recevied the following output with a MemoryError.
Extracting data/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "convolutional.py", line 290, in <module>
    tf.app.run()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/default/_app.py", line 30, in run
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
  File "convolutional.py", line 127, in main
    train_data = extract_data(train_data_filename, 60000)
  File "convolutional.py", line 75, in extract_data
    data = (data - (PIXEL_DEPTH / 2.0)) / PIXEL_DEPTH
MemoryError

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
