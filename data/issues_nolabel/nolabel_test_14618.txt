Error in tf.image.extract_glimpse documentation

Hi,
I think there is an error into the documentation of the tf.image.extract_glimpse into the offsets definition:
offsets: A Tensor of type float32. A 2-D integer tensor of shape [batch_size, 2] containing the x, y locations of the center of each window.
Are you sure it is not y,x instead? Also into the previous field:
size: A Tensor of type int32. A 1-D tensor of 2 elements containing the size of the glimpses to extract. The glimpse height must be specified first, following by the glimpse width.
So for size you place height (y) before width (x) which is the usual thing to do, but in offsets you require to have x (width) before y (height) which I think is wrong.
Thanks,
Andrea
