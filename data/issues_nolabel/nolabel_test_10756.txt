Embedding visualizer of tensorboard is a blank page

System information

Describe the problem
Similarily to this stackoverflow question I have completely blank page without any controls when I'm trying to use the tensorboard embedding visualizer from the latest master. There is nothing in logs (at least on default log level).
Tensorboard from 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 binaries is working.
