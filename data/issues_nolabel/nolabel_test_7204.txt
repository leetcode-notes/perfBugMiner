Should use math_ops.reduce_prod() in mixture.py instead of array_ops.reduce_prod()

Hi,
I tried to use mixture density distribution with batch_size None, and triggered this error
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/mixture.pyc in _sample_n(self, n, seed)
    260       else:
    261         batch_shape = self.batch_shape()
--> 262         batch_size = array_ops.reduce_prod(batch_shape)
    263       static_event_shape = self.get_event_shape()
    264       if static_event_shape.is_fully_defined():

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'reduce_prod'
Please see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/mixture.py#L262
I believe this is a bug since reduce_prod is in math_ops.py instead of array_ops.py.
I'm using version v0.12.1, but I checked it's the same for r1.0
Thanks
