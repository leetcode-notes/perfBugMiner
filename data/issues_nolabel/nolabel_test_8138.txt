gradient_override_map should raise an error if passed invalid gradient names.

Currently, gradient_override_map does not complain if passed in nonsensical information (apart from the simple check to make sure the map is a map from strings to strings).
For instance, the following lines of code run without issue:
with graph.gradient_override_map({"nonsense": "more_nonsense"}): input = tf.sign(input)
A more subtle point (that happened with me), when attempting to override sign's gradient, the following typo ran without problem:
with graph.gradient_override_map({"sign": "Identity"}): input = tf.sign(input)
("sign" should be "Sign").
Seems like a fairly simple issue, but I am not quite versed enough in the Tensorflow backend to suggest a fix to this problem.
