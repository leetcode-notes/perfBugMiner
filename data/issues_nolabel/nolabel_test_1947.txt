tensor flow programs using gpu freeze instance

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 on AWS g2.2xlarge
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: cuda-7.15 cudnn-4.0.7
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
lib/libcudart.so  lib/libcudart.so.7.5  lib/libcudart.so.7.5.18  lib/libcudart_static.a
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
commit bc5e961
so tensorflow 0.8.0
but also tried 0.7.1
commit 028d0b4
Steps to reproduce
all larger tensor flow scripts freeze. I can run simple examples like doing a matmul on the GPU but all larger programs, either my own or from the source (for example tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10_train.py) freeze after a short time (no more output and not able to ctrl-C or ctrl-Z). Also the time of freeze seems to vary - I once made it through 2 epochs of training of my own NN before it froze.
example output:
python cifar10_train.py

and nothing happening (I did wait a lot longer than a few minutes before ctrl-C as well)
but this  script here works and executes on GPU:
import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.constant([[3.,3.]])
b = tf.constant([[2.],[2.]])
c = tf.matmul(a,b)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
print sess.run(c)
