Fixes of AutoParallel bug

This PR fixes the bug that AutoParallel sets variables as don't_replicate_nodes, but not for variable initializers and snapshot nodes. This can break variable collections in meta graph because variable initializers and snapshot nodes could be replicated with different names.
This issue is already discussed in #9906.
