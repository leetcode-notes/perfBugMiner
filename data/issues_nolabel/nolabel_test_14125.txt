[feature request] Does android tensorflow make the without considering front-camera and landscape mode ?

Fist bump.
I want to make a tensorflow application available in landscape also, facing-mode
But, during the development-
There was a problem that  coordinates were displayed wrong when the front camera and landscape mode was used to detect the object, after inference
Do you have  any reference code or other resources ?
Have a nice day  :)
