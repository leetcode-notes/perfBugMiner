Enable fully_connected to uniquify the scope name

The implementation of tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected uses variable_op_scope to handle the name scope of the variables, the problem is that the name scope is only uniquified if scope is None, that is, if you dont pass a custom name, by default it will be "fully_connected".
However, in the library I am building I create tons of shorcut methods like relu_layer, sigmoid_layer, etc, which are implemented using fully_connected plus their corresponding activation function. I'd like these names to be uniquified automatically so I don't get these kind of errors:

ValueError: Variable relu_layer/weights already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope?

In the mean time, could you give me a hint of how to uniquify a variable name scope myself? Is there a function that does this already?
Thanks!
