Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.

Note that I don't even have the source files on my computer. Any idea of what it might be?
Thanks for the help.
