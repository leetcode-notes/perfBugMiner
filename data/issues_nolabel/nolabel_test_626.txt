Cannot restore large model

I'm using tf.train.save.Saver to save my model parameters which come out to be ~1.5GB on disk. When I try to reload the model I get a segmentation fault (this is on a machine with 60GB memory). This also happens when using the option restore_sequentially=True. I found an option to shard the save, but it saves one file per device -- surprisingly there are two files, one is virtually nothing and the other is ~1.5GB for a CPU-only machine, so this didn't help. How can I save my model in such a way that I can get it back into memory?
Update:
I tried saving/loading a smaller model. Surprising the save came out to be ~2GB, which is a larger than the save file of the original model; and this 2GB file loaded fine when restoring the model. So perhaps my original model is really larger than 1.5GB and failed to save properly.
