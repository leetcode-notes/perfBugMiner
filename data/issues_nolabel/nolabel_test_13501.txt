Feature Request: collections scope

The is currently no way to assign variables to collections during creation time other than specifying in the explicit function call to tf.get_variable or tf.Variable.  This is problematic anytime you'd like to use existing functions that create variables as part of their calls and you want those variables to be part of a certain collection.  It's even more problematic when you want variables to not be members of  GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES, because this is the default for the tf.get_variable and tf.Variable.
