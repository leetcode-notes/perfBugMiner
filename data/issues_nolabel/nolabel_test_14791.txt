TFLite: get closer to build with Bazel on Windows

Bazel cannot yet build TensorFlow Lite on Windows,
but this commit gets us closer.
In this commit:

make the -Wno-implicit-fallthrough compiler flag
in flatbuffers' BUILD file be conditional to
non-Windows builds, because MSVC doesn't know
this flag
fix the Bazel build command in README.md by
removing single quotes around --cxxflags,
because it's not needed on Bash and is harmful
on Windows (because cmd.exe doesn't remove the
single quotes)
fix non-ASCII quotes and apostrophes, as well as
some formatting issues in README.md
