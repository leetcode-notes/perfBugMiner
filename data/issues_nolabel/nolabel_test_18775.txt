Fix cmake build issues with GPU on Linux

This fix is an attempt to fix the build issues with GPU on Linux.
Previously cmake on Linux only works for CPU build.
This fix addresses multiple issues on cmake file so that GPU build could work on Linux as well.
The build is performed on Ubuntu 16.04 + CUDA 9.0 + NCCL v21, with the following command:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -Dtensorflow_ENABLE_GPU=ON \
  -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/ \
  -Dtensorflow_CUDNN_INCLUDE=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/include/ \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../tensorflow/contrib/cmake
$ make -j 4 all

This fix fixes #17232.
