Replace deprecated api links in deep_cnn tutorial issue #7001

Replace three deprecated tf.train summary operations by the most close alternatives in the latest TF release found under tf.summary instead.
I am not sure if there is an automatic tool which should update these links or not, but I just wanted to try to help.
