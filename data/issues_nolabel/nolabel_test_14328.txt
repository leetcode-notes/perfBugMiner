DataLossError (see above for traceback): corrupted record at 46064268          [[Node: parallel_read/ReaderReadV2_2 = ReaderReadV2[_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](parallel_read/TFRecordReaderV2_2, parallel_read/filenames)]]

I am trying to train AlexNet from scratch through slim (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim).
My setup is Python 2.7.12, Tensorflow 1.0.0, in a Linux16.04 system. Below is my error report after 3 hours training.

A similar problem also exists when I train vgg_16 using slim. May I know how to solve this?
