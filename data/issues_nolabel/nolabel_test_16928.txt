[MSVC] Use explicit func pointer to static method instead of lambda func

MSVC cannot decide the common type to accept two lambda functions even though they are non-capturing and have the same function signatures.
Since they just pass parameters to static methods, just use function pointers to these static methods.
using EqShapeFuncType = bool (*)(const Shape&, const Shape&) is really just for readability. I just thought that reader might not be able to figure out the function signature if I just use auto eq_shapes = layout_sensitive ? ShapeUtil::Equal : ShapeUtil::Compatible.
