Has this issue been solved for all containers - ImportError: cannot import name audio_ops

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): I am running the tutorial "audio recognition network"
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):('v1.0.0-rc2-15-g47bba63-dirty', '1.0.0')
Python version: 2.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):NA
CUDA/cuDNN version:NA
GPU model and memory:NA
Exact command to reproduce: python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py

Describe the problem
I pip-installed tensorflow using virtualenv. Then I run -
python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py       for which the following error message appears:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/cogknit/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py", line 79, in 
import input_data
File "/home/cogknit/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/input_data.py", line 35, in 
from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops import audio_ops as contrib_audio
ImportError: cannot import name audio_ops
In stack overflow, I came across the same issue only with anaconda install in the following link -
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45952387/anaconda-install-of-tensorflow-missing-audio-ops-from-contrib-framework
There, the answer indicated that the "audio_ops.py" file is missing from the framework and hasn't been released yet .This indication seems to be validated by a developer in the following link and recently an update seems to have been made/released per the same link  : #11339
My question in particular is does the release solve the error in virtualenv installation too? Or hasn't it been solved at all? Is it better to move to a docker installation?Are there any alternatives/commands that   I can use to circumvent this error?
#12722  dealt with the same error but the solution seems to have worked only for tensorflow built from source. Is there anything that I should check again?
Thank you,
