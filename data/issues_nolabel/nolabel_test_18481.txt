Fix crash when invalid dtype was passed

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #18474 where crash may happen if invalid dtype (e.g., "[,]") is passed to tf.constant(tf.string, "[,]"). The crash happens during the comparision of "[,]" and numpy dtype candidate (e.g., np.dtype([("qint8", np.int8, 1)]):
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.dtype([("qint8", np.int8, 1)]) == "[,]"
Segmentation fault: 11

This fix adds a type check to make sure the type of the passed dtype is either numpy.dtype or type.
This fix fixes #18474.
