accuracy.eval on MNIST, extremely slow on Win7, P3.5 CPU only

Hi I tested the MNIST tutorial on Win7, Python3.5, CPU only. Icore5.
Tested with Geany+CMD console, and Idle+Python shell.
I found that everything runs fine, but the accuracy.eval routine takes more than 20min to run on the MNIST test data. Normally that is done within less than a minute (Ubuntu).  As soon as the evaluation starts, I am not able to use any other programs. Looks like the CPU is completely blocked by calculations from the eval routine. Any idea how to optimize??
print("test accuracy %g"%accuracy.eval(feed_dict={
x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels, keep_prob: 1.0}))
