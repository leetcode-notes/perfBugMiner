Support CMake options to use external package providers like zlib, GRPC, Eigen

This PR is to add the ability to use external package providers like GRPC, zlib, Eigen .etc. It is not possible to compile project using two different versions of protobuf right now.
This is a continuous work of PR #16210. As discussed there, it did something similar to GRPC package whether you specify tensorflow__PROVIDER variable. It will determine if tensorflow needs to download dependency and use it as a module or use find_package() to find package.

Add ability to use external GRPC, zlib, Eigen and mb some other packages. Because right now it is impossible to compile your project with tensorflow if you're using different version of GRPC. I did something similar to GRPC package whether you specify tensorflow__PROVIDER variable. It will determine if tensorflow needs to download dependency and use it as a module or use find_package() to find package.
