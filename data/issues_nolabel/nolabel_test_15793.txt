Feature Request: tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession implementation for slim.learning.train

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): N/A
TensorFlow version (use command below): N/A
Python version:  N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

This is a feature request:
Issue #6263 states that tf.train.Supervisor is to be deprecated. Since the slim.learning.train uses Supervisor internally, is it still advisable to use it?
Or are there any chances to implement the slim.learning.train to use tf.train.MonitoredSession instead of Supervisor?
