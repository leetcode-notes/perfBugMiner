AttributeError: 'GFile' object has no attribute 'writelines

Hi when i try to execute this code:
from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile ... with gfile.GFile("%s_%s" % (target_path, len_d + len_q), mode="w") as tokens_file: tokens_file.writelines(results)...
I obtain the following error:
AttributeError: 'GFile' object has no attribute 'writelines'
Why GFile haven't writelines attribute in verision 1.2? What method should i use instead? Thanks a lot.
