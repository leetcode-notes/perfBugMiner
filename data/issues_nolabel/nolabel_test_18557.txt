'Missing required flag: input_file' when using TOCO with SavedModel

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce: toco --savedmodel_directory=/Models/Final/1523530083 --output_file=move.tflite

Describe the problem
I have a SavedModel trained and I am trying to use TOCO to convert it to tflite format. When I use the above command, given as an example in the docs here I get prompted for the input_format. Specifying this as TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF gives a new error for output_format. Specifying this as TFLITE now prompts for required parameter input_file. As this is a SavedModel and not a GraphDef, I can't provide the input_file and in fact, shouldn't have to as savedmodel_directory has already been provided.
The model directory 1523530083 contains saved_model.pb and a variables folder. There are no assets.
