Cannot find libdevice.10.bc under /usr/local/cuda-8.0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.38-rt49-tegra aarch64)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0-rc0, r1.7, master
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6
GPU model and memory: name: GP106 major: 6 minor: 1 totalMemory: 3.75GiB (as reported by some previous version of Tensorflow on the other part of the same Drive PX2)
Exact command to reproduce:
git checkout v1.7.0-rc0
./configure
bazel build //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so

Describe the problem
Same problem for all branches listed under TensorFlow version.
Build fails immediately with
Cuda Configuration Error: Cannot find libdevice.10.bc under /usr/local/cuda-8.0
It's strange because I explicitly answered 8.0 versions and libdevice.10.bc exists only in 9.0 AFAIK.
