how to build the project for intel x86 emulator instead of armeabi v7?

Hi, I am beginner in android,
I have successfully built the android demo with bazel. Now I am trying to work with it in Android studio.
I found this repository https://github.com/miyosuda/TensorFlowAndroidDemo.
It currently works well with armeabiv7 but crashes with intel x86  emulator.
But I want to build it for intel x86 and x86_64 and I want to build it in Android studio using gradle what should I do? Please help
I am using
NDK 10re
Android Studio 2.0
UBUNTU 14.04
