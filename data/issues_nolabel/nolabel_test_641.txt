Mac install inside virtualenv cannot import examples

I tried the tutorial on my mac, after using virtualenv to install (the normal pip installation failed for me).
I ran
$ cd $PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV_OF_TENSORFLOW
$ source ./bin/activate
(tensorflow)$ python
>>> import tensorflow as tf  # This succeeds
>>> from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named examples.tutorials.mnist
Inspecting the module tensorflow shows there is no submodule named "examples".
I think this is a Mac only issue, not sure if it's only virtualenv too.  When I tried the above on Linux it worked for me.
