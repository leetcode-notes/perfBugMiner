TensorFlowInferenceInterface Constructor with Graph

Added a new Constructor with Graph object only, it would be very useful for custom graph loading. Combining with #12668, user can even perform custom graph loading in C/C++ via Android NDK as well.
New Constructor Signature: public TensorFlowInferenceInterface(Graph g)
