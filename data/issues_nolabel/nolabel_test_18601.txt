Fix tf.compat.as_str returns bytes issue in Python 3

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #18598 where tf.compat.as_str returns bytes (vs. str) in Python 3.
The issue was that tf_export decorator:
@tf_export('compat.as_bytes', 'compat.as_str')

could not be assigned to as_bytes or as_text based on python 2 or 3.
This fix invokes tf_export explicitly based on _six.PY2 (for python 2/3) so that as_str calls as_bytes or as_text conditionally.
This fix fixes #18598.
