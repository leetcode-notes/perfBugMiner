How to uninstall tensorflow?

Help I want to reinstall tensorflow, from GPU to CPU, because, just installed tensorflow not work correctly.
I test my installation, from documentation of tensorflow.org,
then it gives back that error:
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.



import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'constant'



SO SHOULD I REINSTALL TENSORFLOW?
before I installed by pip, but it did not work then I use virtualen, also did not work, then by using anaconda. something worked, but I stack in testing installation. Help me!
