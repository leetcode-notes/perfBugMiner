Separate tensorboard from tensorflow (core)

I suggest to separate tensorboard from tensorflow.
This could mean:

break tensorboard to its own repos (under the same organization)
publish a separate tensorboard wheel / package on pypi.

The advantages of this are:

simpler building of tensorboard which will make it easier for non core tensorflow members to contribute to the development of the project.
tensorboard to operate on its own release cycle
simpler installation of tensorboard (it can be installed on its own without needing full install of tensorflow)
