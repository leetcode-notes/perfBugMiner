Automatically convert inputs to tensors in Dataset.from_tensor_slices

Allows usage like:
tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg'], [1, 2]])
Otherwise, the two input lists (2 of size 2 here) were flattened into 1 list (of size 4), which resulted in a "list index out of range" error.
My correction was inspired by how the tf.train.slice_input_producer is defined: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/training/input.py#L302
