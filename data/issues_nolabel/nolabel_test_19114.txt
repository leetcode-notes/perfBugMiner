Add support to identify elements in tensors

Problem description:
I want to create symmetric matrix, which contains only n(n + 1) / 2 trainable parameters.
In general case i want to create tensor, where some elements are the same as trainable parameters.
Why is it so important?

PointNet article about 3D point cloud classification: contains symmetric matrices for estimation
Symmetric differential equations
Completeness of framework as a tool for optimization tasks

One possible way to do it is to stack and concatenate different variables, but i think, low level possibility of this feature has a better perfomance
Sorry for my English.
