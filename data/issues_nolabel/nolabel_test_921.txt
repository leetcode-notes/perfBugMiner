tensorflow.Session() Hangs on 24-Logical Core Machine

We have a newish (<6 months old) server with two hyperthreaded 6-core processors, and when we try to create a tensorflow.Session(), it hangs indefinitely in what top reports is state D (uninterruptible sleep), unresponsive even to SIGKILL. Relevant output is below.
>>> sess = tf.Session() 
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:40] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 24
