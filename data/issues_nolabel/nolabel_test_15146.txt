Allow keras applications to load weights from arbitrary path

This PR allows tensorflow.python.keras.applications to load pretrained weights from an arbitrary filepath (rather than only ~/.keras/models).  It is the parallel PR to fchollet/keras#8637 which was merged by @fchollet on November 30.
This change allows useres to load models in environments with limited access to ~/.keras/models
Kaggle notebooks are an example of this environment, and this PR will help us support Keras in TensorFlow.
I have locally tested that I get the same predictions when loading a model with weights='imagenet' and with weights pointing to another location with the same pretrained model file.
