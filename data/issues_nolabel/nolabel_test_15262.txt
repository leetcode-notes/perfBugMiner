Bug with tf.layers.Dense

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Exact command to reproduce:

with tf.variable_scope('hello') as var_scope:
var = tf.get_variable('var', [3,4,5])
dense = tf.layers.Dense(5, name = 'dense_layer')
b = dense(a)
And the error was :
RuntimeError: Conversion function <function _TensorConversionFunction at 0x7f5bed522b90> for type <class 'tensorflow.python.ops.variables.Variable'> returned incompatible dtype: requested = float32_ref, actual = float32
