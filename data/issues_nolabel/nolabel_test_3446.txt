iOS example with Image Retraining model always gives the same prediction

Environment info
Running on: iOS 9.1
Building on OS X El Capitan version 10.11, Xcode version 7.3.1
TensorFlow release 0.9
Steps to reproduce
Follow the contrib/makefile/README to install the tensorflow iOS core lib
Create my own model with the Image Retraining tutorial
Run the iOS example, same error as #2883 is logged.
After fixing errors as suggested same prediction is always given.

2016-07-21 18:20:06.582 tf_ios_makefile_example[949:323060] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
    Try this: 
        (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
        (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. 
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17594000 V:|-(20)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x176b59d0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x17597ab0 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17593e30 'UIInputWindowController-top' V:|-(0)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x176b59d0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x17597ab0 )>"
)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x17594000 V:|-(20)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x176b59d0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x17597ab0 )>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.

#2883 I encountered the same error related to DecodeJpeg and then followed the fixes suggested there, but I get the same prediction no matter what I point the camera at. Similarly if i work with the "simple" project and change the photo being identified I still get the same prediction that in the log output above
