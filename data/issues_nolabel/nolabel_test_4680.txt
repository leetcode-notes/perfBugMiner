./third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor:1:42: fatal error: unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor: No such file or directory

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
I'm trying to build the pi-examples by building the tensorflow via makefile on Linux(Ubuntu 14.04).
So 1st I've done "Building on Linux" successfully from here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile#building-on-linux
now at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples I'm trying to build camera example, but when I've run make -f tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/Makefile command, the result came out as follows on terminal:
gcc --std=c++11 -O0 -I/usr/local/include -I. -I/home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/../../makefile/downloads -I/home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/../../makefile/downloads/eigen-latest/ -I/home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/../../makefile/gen/proto/ -I/home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/../../makefile/gen/proto_text/ -c tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/camera.cc -o /home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/gen/obj/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/camera.o In file included from ./tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h:19:0, from tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/camera.cc:33: ./third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor:1:42: fatal error: unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor: No such file or directory #include "unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor" ^ compilation terminated. make: *** [/home/tushar/Desktop/tushar/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/gen/obj/tensorflow/contrib/pi_examples/camera/camera.o] Error 1
Why? could anyone confirm me that third-party library specially (eigen3) is complete or something missing.
I've also tried with replacing it's third-party eigen3 library by separately downloaded library, but that create new error, but similar to this (i.e. XYZ...   No such file or directory)
