DropoutWrapper has unintended mask behavior when random seed is set

When using the non-dynamic rnn, if the seed is set to something other than None for DropoutWrapper, the dropout masks for the inputs become synchronized across time steps. I.e. the same input dimension is dropped for all time steps for a given entry in a batch. If the maximum number of time steps varies between batches, then the later time steps begin to go out of sync (but all time steps that are earlier than the shortest sequence remain synchronized throughout). This behavior only affects the statically rolled out rnn. Dynamically rolled out RNNs using dynamic_rnn are always randomized per time step.
