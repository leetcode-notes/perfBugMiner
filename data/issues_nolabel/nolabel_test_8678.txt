wget issue with links in workspace.bzl

Hello,
I'm trying to build from the most recent master branch as of today and am getting this error during the ./configure step:
ERROR: Evaluation of query "deps(((//tensorflow/... - //tensorflow/contrib/nccl/...) - //tensorflow/examples/android/...))" failed: errors were encountered while computing transitive closure.
every rule of type _py_wrap_cc implicitly depends upon the target '@swig//:swig',
every rule of type _py_wrap_cc implicitly depends upon the target '@swig//:templates'
The links from a preliminary glance take much longer than expected albeit being relatively small.
I've already looked at these but the links are outdated.
#5432
#8619
#4312
...
And a lot more that don't seem effective

##Attempted Solution
Lots of changing the links to older versions. Also tried building Bazel by source for 0.4.3 and 0.4.5.
Been stuck on this for a couple of hourst. Following any previous solution seems to not work as other issues arise (Such as using Bazel 0.4.3).
My very strong suspicion is that the links are down.
wget http://bazel-mirror.storage.googleapis.com/ufpr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/swig/swig/swig-3.0.8/swig-3.0.8.tar.gz

will take an obscenely long amount of time and as a result timeout. My internet is fine (university) and all else is fine. My GPU is a NVIDIA 1080 GTX connected to my mac via thunderbolt cable.
