Flag names no longer compatible with argparse

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 17.10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.5.0-0-g37aa430d84 1.5.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
tf.app.flags.DEFINE_string(
    name='flag-name',
    default=None,
    help='Flag description.'
)
print(tf.app.flags.FLAGS.flag_name)

Describe the problem
Up to version 1.4.1 you would be able to access the flag defined as "flag-name" via FLAGS.flag_name just like in argparse. Since 1.5.0 this functionality is no longer available.
Source code / logs
Here's the traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "flagtest.py", line 15, in <module>
    print(tf.app.flags.FLAGS.flag_name)
  File "/code/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/flags.py", line 85, in __getattr__
    return wrapped.__getattr__(name)
  File "/code/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/absl/flags/_flagvalues.py", line 470, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError(name)
AttributeError: flag_name

Since up to version 1.4.1 this was the default functionality, bringing this back should not affect many projects.
