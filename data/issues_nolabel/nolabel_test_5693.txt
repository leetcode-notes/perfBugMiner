install Pillow in Dockerfile

Hi team,
When i used tensorflow in python, sometimes i try the code like
scipy.misc.imread('test.tif')
but i get an error:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'imread'.
After some digging, i find i need to install PIL from the docs on scipy.misc. i guess there may be some other developers using tensorflow in my way (e.g. fast-style-transfer src/utils.py/#9).
So i would like to suggest adding Pillow into docker image build.
