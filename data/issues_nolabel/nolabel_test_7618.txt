Windows 7 build problem. "Release" folder is missing from protoc.exe path

I'm trying to build tensorflow 1.0 on windows 7, using cmake.
I have generated the project, but when I try to build it I get this error:

Error	MSB6006	"cmd.exe" exited with code 9009.	tf_protos_cc	C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets	171

The output logs says:

1>------ Build started: Project: zlib, Configuration: Release x64 ------
1>  Performing update step for 'zlib'
2>------ Build started: Project: protobuf, Configuration: Release x64 ------
2>  Performing update step for 'protobuf'

========== Build: 2 succeeded, 1 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

What I noticed is that it's looking for protoc.exe at the location: protobuf\src\protobuf\\protoc.exe and I can confirm that the real location is: protobuf\src\protobuf\Release\protoc.exe
The double \ makes it seem like the path was suppose to include "Release" but didn't for some reason.
If you need any additional info please let me know.
