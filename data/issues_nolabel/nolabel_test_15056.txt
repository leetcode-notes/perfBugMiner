tf.losses.mean_squared_error is actually sum of squares

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-rc1-5211-gab0fcac 1.5.0-dev20171124
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

To truly get mean squared error one has to explictly use reduction=Reduction.MEAN. This indicates bad naming. Maybe squared_error is a better name, also similar to other names in tf.losses
