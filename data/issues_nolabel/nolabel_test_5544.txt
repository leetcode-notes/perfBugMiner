lack of up-to-date files after upgrading to tensorflow 0.11

I just upgraded tensorflow to 0.11 by using conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow , but still lack of files in anaconda2/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/examples/tutorials, such as mnist_softmax.py. The current files I have in this folder are:
__init__.py 
__init__.pyc
input_data.py
input_data.pyc
mnist.py
mnist.pyc
