Return type annotation

Added type annotations in the docstring to the return types of dataset functions.
Presented like this, they can automatically be read by tools (I have tested that this works in PyCharm) to improve auto-completion when coding.
This is really useful in case of datasets, because they often result in long chained calls (something like Dataset.generate...(...).map(...).repeat(...).batch(...)). With this patch, code completion works after every . (again, I have only tested PyCharm).
