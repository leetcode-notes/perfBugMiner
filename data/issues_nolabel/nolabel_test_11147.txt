having problem to identify porn images -> especaly with penises (NO its not a joke!!!)

i m running a website where a mass on photos are uploaded (upload without registration)... so i get aaaaa lot of penis-trolls or whatever makes them post their private parts... anyhow...
i tried to train inception model with tensorflow (newest version 1.x) - so i made a   folder with "penises" (approx 160 pics) and one with different images with person how dont show their penis (approx 160 pics)....
training accuracy is quit good -> over 90 % - but testing the model with other pictures - it fails really bad on detecting penises....
hmmmm, i know.. 160 pics are not that much for training, but i thing the problem is:
guy on the beach in shorts is: ok
guy on the beach with penis lurking out of his pants: is not okay..
but the difference is quite small between the pictures... because a penis is (mostly) quite a small part of the human body ... so hard to detect...
anybody could help? and no, its sounds funny, buts no joke.. i suffering under all the uploads i have to review manualy.... it's really not funny to see over 1000 penises a day :(
cheers, puck
