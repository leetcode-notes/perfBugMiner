Enable multi-dimensional and axis support for tf.unique_with_counts

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #16499 to bring multi-dimensional and axis support for unique_with_counts.
When UniqueV2 kernel was added in #12952, it actually already implemented the multi-dimensional and axis support for unique_with_counts as well, just not registered.
This fix:

Register UniqueWithCountsV2 kernel to have axis support.
Hide both UniqueWithCounts and UniqueWithCountsV2
Add python unique_with_counts wrapper to call gen_array_ops._unique_with_counts
If API review passes and the PR merges, unique_with_counts will switch to gen_array_ops._unique_with_counts_v2 (in 3 weeks).
Add additional test cases for gen_array_ops._unique_with_counts_v2.

This fix fixes #16499.
