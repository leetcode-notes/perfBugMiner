tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio console flood

When we evaluate the tensor returned by tensorflow.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio(), the ffmpeg log shows up in the terminal, leading to a flood of messages when decoding a large number of files.
Asked here as well. I could not find an easy way such as an environment variable for ffmpeg to turn off the output log, there is only a command-line argument loglevel but TF's decode_audio() does not support it.
Currently using ffmpeg 3.4 (gcc 7.2.0) and tensorflow 1.4.0 on linux.
