Update word2vec_basic.py in generate_batch

File "/word2vec_***_basic.py", line 139, in generate_batch
buffer[:] = data[:span]
TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'
got above messages running in python 2.7
updating line 139 from "buffer[:] = data[:span]" to :
buffer.extend(data[0:span])
The updating has passed my own test and can works.
thanks.
