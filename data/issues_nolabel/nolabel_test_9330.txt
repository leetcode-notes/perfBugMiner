Getting error: Number of tensor does not match the number of lines in metadata

Even though my metadata.tsv have 100k line but it still show up this message. I have try different amount of tensor and its work fine (eg. 40k, 50k). The problem occurred when the tensor values are roughly more than 70k.
Beside, i try other data set and its work fine for 100k tensor values. Just doubt what makes the problem above happend.
