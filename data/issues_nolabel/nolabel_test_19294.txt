Add shape validation in shape function of MapAndBatchDataset

In MapAndBatchDataset, batch_size, num_parallel_batches, and drop_remainder are 0-D scalars. This fix adds the shape check to those Inputs.
Note since the Input of other_arguments is a list and is before batch_size, this PR uses the index from the end of the inputs to retrieve the shape, without guessing the number of other_arguments.
