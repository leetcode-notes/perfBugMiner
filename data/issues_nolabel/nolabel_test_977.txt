Word2Vec.py ReluGrad is not finite

Running the tutorial as downloaded from tensorflow.org results in an exception stating that the ReluGrad is not finite.  This happens with the learning rate set to .00001 and concurrent steps set to 1.  Once this exception is thrown, learning stops.  It happens at epoch 0, roughly step 500,000.
