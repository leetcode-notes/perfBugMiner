Describe the problem
When a placeholder is defined in a tf.cond statement, shape checking is not enforced until the merge, and ends up being only rank checking.
Source code / logs
Consider the following toy graph/session, developed in the pursuit of a larger issue.  I suspect this entire approach of trying to have differently shaped placeholders is doomed to failure.  But, the graph produced clearly shows placeholders of appropriate shape inside the conditional; shows appropriately sized tensors flowing into the merge, but shows the merge itself as shape (?,?) and that is where the shape checking happens.  As a result, you can put just about any rank two tensor in and set the boolean to anything you like and tensorflow doesn't care.
Heck, you can make another op completely outside the conditional to compute matmul (a, matrix_inverse(a)) and it'll chug merrily along.
Is this the desired behavior?
with graph.as_default():
    pred   = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[])

    def fnTrue():
        a      = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[5, 1], name="column")
        return a

    def fnFalse():
        a      = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1, 5], name="row")
        return a

    a = tf.cond(pred, fnTrue, fnFalse, name="my_conditional")
graphWriter = tf.summary.FileWriter(logdir='logdir', graph=graph)
graphWriter.flush()

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:
    writer_graph         = tf.summary.FileWriter(LogPath , session.graph)
    writer_graph.flush()
    writer_graph.close()
    plTrue       = np.ones((15, 2)) * 2     # column
    plFalse      = np.ones((12, 15)) * 3     # row
    feed_dict = {
        a            : plTrue,
        pred         : False
    }

    d = session.run( a , feed_dict = feed_dict)
    print(d)
    print(d.shape)
