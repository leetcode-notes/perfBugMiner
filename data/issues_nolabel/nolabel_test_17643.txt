Failed to import the TensorFlow module

I tried to install TensorFlow (CPU only) on windows 10 and python 3.6 (64 bit) and after write
import tensorflow as tf
{ hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello)) }
on visual studio 2017 I got this

Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.
See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#common_installation_problems
for some common reasons and solutions.  Include the entire stack trace
above this error message when asking for help.
,I used this script

and I got this
ERROR: Failed to import the TensorFlow module.
Since TensorFlow 1.4, the self-check has been integrated with TensorFlow itself,
and any missing DLLs will be reported when you execute the import tensorflow
statement. The error messages printed below refer to TensorFlow 1.3 and earlier,
and are inaccurate for later versions of TensorFlow.


Python version is 3.6.


TensorFlow is installed at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\lib\site-packages\tensorflow


Could not load 'cudart64_80.dll'. The GPU version of TensorFlow
requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in
your %PATH% environment variable. Download and install CUDA 8.0 from
this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit


Could not load 'nvcuda.dll'. The GPU version of TensorFlow requires that
this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH%
environment variable. Typically it is installed in 'C:\Windows\System32'.
If it is not present, ensure that you have a CUDA-capable GPU with the
correct driver installed.


Could not find cuDNN 6.
The GPU version of TensorFlow requires that the correct cuDNN DLL be installed
in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Note that
installing cuDNN is a separate step from installing CUDA, and it is often
found in a different directory from the CUDA DLLs. The correct version of
cuDNN depends on your version of TensorFlow:

TensorFlow 1.2.1 or earlier requires cuDNN 5.1. ('cudnn64_5.dll')
TensorFlow 1.3 or later requires cuDNN 6. ('cudnn64_6.dll')

You may install the necessary DLL by downloading cuDNN from this URL:
