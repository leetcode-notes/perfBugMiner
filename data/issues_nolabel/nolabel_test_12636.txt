Removing slightly confusing ">" from output

I found the > a bit confusing in the output of import_pb_to_tensorboard.py:
$ python import_pb_to_tensorboard.py --model_dir ~/mnist_model_graph.pb --log_dir /tmp/tensorflow_logdir
Model Imported. Visualize by running: > tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logdir

If you include that symbol when trying to launch tensorboard, it fails:
$ > tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logdir
-bash: --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logdir: No such file or directory

Yes, this is relatively obvious to a knowledgable programmer, but if this isn't there for a specific reason, then we may as well remove it. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
AFTER THE FIX
Tested on Mac OS X Siera 10.12.6.
$ python import_pb_to_tensorboard.py --model_dir ~/mnist_model_graph.pb --log_dir /tmp/tensorflow_logdir
Model Imported. Visualize by running: tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logdir
