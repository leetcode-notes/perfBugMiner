fix _Pooling1D data format bug

When data_format is channels_last, input is NWC, so we have to expand_dim(1) to make it become NHWC. Then we apply pooling on W which is the 3rd dimention.
When data_format is channels_first, input is NCW, so we have to expand_dim(2) to make it become NCHW. Then we apply pooling on W, which is the 4th dimention.
