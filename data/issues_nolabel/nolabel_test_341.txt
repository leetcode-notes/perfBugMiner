Forking TensorFlow after You Already Pip Installed

Hey TF, love your code.
I recently forked and cloned TF because I wanted to add some new features to it.
However, previously I pip installed it, so my question is:
How do I change it so that when I call in import TensorFlow, it comes from my specified directory (cloned dir) and not the one in dist-packages?
Do I need to re-install TensorFlow? Or can I just simply use the scripts found in my TensorFlow clone?
Thanks!
