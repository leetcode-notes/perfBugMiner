apply_gradients.run seems to leak memory

I'm running a large scale network with tensorflow and I keep getting memory errors, so I pull out memory_profiler and found this
Filename: parameterservermodel.py
Line    Memtotal    Increment   Line Contents
110   2121.9 MiB     39.2 MiB            self.apply_gradients.run(session=self.session, feed_dict=feed_dict)
If I'm not mistaken, it looks like like apply_gradients.run allocates almost 40MB and doesn't return anything for me to free. I might be missing something here.
