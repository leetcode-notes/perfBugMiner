helloworld sucks

The first place people are going to start with tensorflow is: http://tensorflow.org/get_started
The hello world on that page sucks.  First of all, why the variable names b, W, and y?  Lets have descriptive variable names please.  Next, why use the dot product from numpy in this line? y_data = np.dot([0.100, 0.200], x_data) + 0.300.  This just makes things harder to understand.
For a hello world i was expecting something super stripped down and simple like this:

create an input of simple integers or floats like [1,2,3]
create an output array like [10,20,30]
create a neural network
train the neural network given the input of [1,2,3] to output the correct answer of [10,20,30]
save the trained weight/bias map to a file
create a new session, restore the weights/bias map
compute the correct answer again
