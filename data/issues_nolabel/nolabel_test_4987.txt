Feature request: dropout with noise_shape does not support varied batchsize

Since it's convenient to support varied batchsize in tf.placeholder by setting the head element of argument "shape" to None, tf.nn.dropout does not allow None in its argument "noise_shape", leading to models using dropout with noise_shape cumbersome to implement varied batchsize.  I wonder is it possible to allow None in noise_shape for better support for varied batchsize? Thank you!
