[iOS] Add optional Selective Registration of Ops

The current iOS library is huge. Add the ability to selectively
register for the ops the tensorflow library will support. This
greatly reduces resultant binary based on the network.
A "full" arm64 build was 122MB on my machine vs one selectively
registered for SSD Mobilenet was only 93MB.
Also fixes a minor bug where the selected arch wasn't being passed
to the compile_ios_protobuf.sh script.
TEST:build_all_ios.sh -a arm64 # generates a fat binary for arm64
build_all_ios_sh -a arm64 -g ~/Downloads/op_inference_graph.pb
#generates a binary that is much smaller
