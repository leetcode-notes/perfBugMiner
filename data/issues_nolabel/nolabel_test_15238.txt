CPU usage drops after several steps

I am running a tensorflow computation graph. The same graph was running fine before but all of a sudden I noticed that after several steps and checkpoint the CPU usage drops from more than 600% to 100% for the rest of the session. It seems like all executors are dying (when saving maybe) and the computation keeps running on only 1 Core shooting up and down from 100 to 200%.
I also posted the issue on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47720893/tensor-flow-cpu-usage-drops-after-saving
