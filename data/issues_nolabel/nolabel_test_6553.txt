Issue with tf.InteractiveSession()

I try to train a neural net with nested loop tf.while_loop. If I start the session with sess = tf.Session(), the training process will start with the following log for one batch. There seems to be some memory issue, but it still works.

But if I start with sess = tf.InteractiveSession(), there will be errors. The log is as follows. tf.InteractiveSession() isn't really different from tf.Session() by tutorial. I just wonder what is wrong here.
