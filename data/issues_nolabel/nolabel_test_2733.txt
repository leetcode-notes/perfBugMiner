MNIST downloader doesn't work as expected

See: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html

For your convenience, we've included a script which automatically downloads and imports the MNIST dataset. It will create a directory 'MNIST_data' in which to store the data files.

Which currently doesn't create any folder.
