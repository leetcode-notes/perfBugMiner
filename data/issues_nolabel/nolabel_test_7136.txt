../genop/main.go:15: running "sh": exit status 1

I am unable to get the Go binding for TensorFlow working on OS X 10.12. I followed the installation instructions at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/go.
Things go wrong when generating the wrapper functions for TensorFlow ops:
go generate github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/op
The output from the above command is:
../genop/main.go:15: running "sh": exit status 1
op/generate.go:15: running "go": exit status 1
When browsing the sources i see an imported package
"github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/genop/internal/proto/tensorflow/core/framework"
which isn't there. Maybe that is causing the issue?
