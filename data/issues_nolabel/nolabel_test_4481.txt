GradOutput in Torch

Hi all,
I wonder that is there any function that return the gradOutput (gradient w.r.t. the output of the module) of a specific layer like Torch?
Ex:
assume f,g are simple linear functions
f(x)=x'
g(x')=y
I want to directly get the value dy/df(x), the gradient of output
instead of the gradient of variable in f
