Describe the problem
when I call the  tf.contrib.layers.l2_regularizer(0.5)(w), I was toll that "Expected int64, got 0.5 of type 'float' instead." But the doc says that it need a float clearly and as a weight it can't be an integer.
Source code / logs
l2 = 0 for w in tf.global_variables(): l2 += tf.contrib.layers.l2_regularizer(0.5)(w) loss = tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy(onehot_labels=one_hot_labels,logits=result_vector)+l2
