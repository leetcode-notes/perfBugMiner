GPU implementation for RangeSampler and related samplers

The implementation for RangeSampler currently works only for the CPU, even though the sampling is done using SimplePhilox in most cases (which has GPU support). This issue is for tracking all changes to enable GPU support for the samplers.
This issue came into picture while digging for #1140, and affects it directly. Once GPU implementations are written for the samplers related to RangeSampler, float64 can easily be enabled for the *Sampler ops mentioned here.  Some more context can be found in this comment.
