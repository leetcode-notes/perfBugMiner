Add support for the matmul (@) operator.

This PR closes #1062.
Assuming a and b are tensors, a @ b  is equivalent to tf.matmul(a, b).
Note that either a or b can be a NumPy array or a regular python array, for example the following expressions are valid:

a @ [[1.], [2.]]
[[1., 2.]] @ a
a @ np.array([[1.], [2.]])
np.array([[1., 2.]]) @ a
