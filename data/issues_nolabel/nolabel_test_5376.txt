Remove hard coded file system scheme checking in tensorboard code

This pull request addresses #5322.
This patch also fixes the case run_name:gs://path incorrect parsing issue.
There is still one file not cleaned up: directory_watcher.py. However, this does not affecting adding other file systems.
That one can't be removed now because in GCS Stat for folder is not supported. However, according to GCS API document, stat for a folder can be supported by summing sizes of all objects with that common prefix (In fact, our blob store has similar interface, and stat for folder is implemented likewise).
