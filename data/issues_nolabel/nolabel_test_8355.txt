tensorflow's textsum model has version compatibile issue

Hi there,
I installed tensorflow and tried its textsum model. Unfortunately, I hit lots of module has not attribute issues. I used release version it does not compatible with textsum model in github master branch. I build tensorflow from source from master branch. But, there are still lots of version compatible issues.
Anyone here tried this model before? I need to find a release of tesnsorflow and textsum model and they are compatible.
Also, does this model work with tensorflow CPU (not GPU) edition?
thanks in advance!
