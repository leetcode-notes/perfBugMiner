slice shape inference bug

At current HEAD 32bd3d0 with the following code,
A = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
B = A[:5, :]
B.get_shape()

The first dimension of B is unknown, but should be known. I have to use the tf.slice function to get the shape back:
A = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
B = tf.slice(A, [0,0], [5, -1])
B.get_shape()
