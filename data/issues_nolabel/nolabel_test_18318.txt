Is input of tf.contrib.cudnn_rnn.CudnnLSTM time-major?

System information

Describe the problem
I save this in tensorflow/models: quick_draw exmple
you can see that in the comment of this function.  it says that CudnnLSTM is time-major, so it need a transpose. But I don't find this information in documentation here:
Where can I get confirmation of this ?
  def _add_cudnn_rnn_layers(convolved):
    """Adds CUDNN LSTM layers."""
    # Convolutions output [B, L, Ch], while CudnnLSTM is time-major.
    convolved = tf.transpose(convolved, [1, 0, 2])
    lstm = tf.contrib.cudnn_rnn.CudnnLSTM(
        num_layers=params.num_layers,
        num_units=params.num_nodes,
        dropout=params.dropout if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN else 0.0,
        direction="bidirectional")
    outputs, _ = lstm(convolved)
    # Convert back from time-major outputs to batch-major outputs.
    outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, [1, 0, 2])
    return outputs
