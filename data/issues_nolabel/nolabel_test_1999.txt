Add confusion matrix to tensorflow

This MR add a confusion matrix implementation for tensorflow. The function is named confusion_matrix and is a metric operation.
The function receives three parameters, both predictions and targets labels and an optional num_classes:
tf.contrib.metrics.confusion_matrix(predictions, targets, num_classes=None)
If num_classes is not provided, it will be computed using both predictions and targets parameters.
Both predictions and targets must be an 1-D array with dtype int32 or int64. This function will then infer the valid labels from both arrays and create a confusion matrix for them. The confusion matrix will always be a square matrix with shape L X L, considering L as the number of valid labels for a given classification task. The dtype of the confusion matrix will be the same as the predictions and target ones.
For example, given a prediction array: [1, 2, 3, 1], and a target array: [1, 2, 1, 1], the generated confusion matrix would be:
[[0 0 0],
 [2 0 0],
 [0 1 0],
 [1 0 0]]
The rows of the matrix represent the predictions array and the columns, the targets one.
Finally, this function was implemented only for CPU use. This MR resolves the issue #1606, but there is still work to be done on tensorboard considering this function.
