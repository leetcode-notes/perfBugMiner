Dead link to Graph.control_dependencies()

"tf.control_dependencies(control_inputs) {#control_dependencies}
Wrapper for Graph.control_dependencies() using the default graph.
See Graph.control_dependencies() for more details."
The link to Graph.control_dependencies() is dead, but I could really need the details. : 3
(Hope this is the right place the post this. X: )
