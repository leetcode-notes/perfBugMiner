Describe the problem
Opening this issue to mark work I've been doing on implementing a file system for azure blob storage to complement gcs and s3. Opening so that if others are interested or want to test can do so. Also haven't created a WIP PR as still heavily testing and cleaning up.
Imitates the GCS implementation closely and uses curl and boringssl libraries that are already included in part of the build.
