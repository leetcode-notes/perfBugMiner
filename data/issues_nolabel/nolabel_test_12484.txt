Modification and Uniformisation of setup.py files

Hello everyone,
As you may find on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow/json, tensorflow is not reported as a package which is compatible with python 3. Which doesn't prevent to be able to install it with pip properly. it just mess up any API call to the PyPI API (which is not good for all our friends using CI tools).
The reason is actually quite simple: some classifiers were missing.
############ Actual Classifiers as declared on PyPI for TF 1.3.0 ############ 
"classifiers": [
      "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
      "Intended Audience :: Developers",
      "Intended Audience :: Education",
      "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
      "License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License",
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7",  #### ONLY PYTHON 2.7 is flagged
      "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics",
      "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries",
      "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules"
    ]

####### The proposed changes to uniformised the two setup.py and allow Py3 compatibility #######
classifiers=[
       "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
        
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'Intended Audience :: Education',
        'Intended Audience :: Science/Research',
        
        'License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License',
        
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
        
        'Topic :: Scientific/Engineering',
        'Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics',
        'Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence',
        'Topic :: Software Development',
        'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries',  
        'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules',
    ],
So the main objective of this PR is basically to fix the aforesaid issues in the two setup.py i was able to find.
I also took the opportunity to uniformise the two setup.py files. They now declare the same audiences and topics, I hope it will be fine. Else, I can still revert the changes and just keep the changes related to Python 3 compatibility.
Please have a great day,
Best Regards,
