Cauchy Distribution

Added the cauchy distribution to contrib.distributions.
The cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution with undefined moments. I couldn't find an existing implementation to reference against, so I'm not sure if my approach to this:
if self.allow_nan_stats:
  return constant_op.constant(float("nan"), shape=self.batch_shape)
else:
  raise ValueError("`mean` is undefined for Cauchy distribution.")
is correct, please advise.
