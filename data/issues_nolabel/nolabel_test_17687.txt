Unable to match the last equations from the nmt paper in the nmt implementation

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version: 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): not compiled from source
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): not compiled from source
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6
GPU model and memory: 8GB x 4 GTX 1080
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

I have already asked the question over tensorflow/nmt but also asking here to maybe grab some traction:
In the NMT paper, pg 13-14, they've defined the model architecture. In the Decoder section (A 2.2), they've proposed probability of a target word w.r.t the deep output (ti~) with a single maxout hidden layer.
But if I look at the source code where the graph is built, it calls the _build_decoder function where the decoder section is built, I could not find the implementation of these equations:

Can someone clarify as to how those equations are included in the nmt implementation?
