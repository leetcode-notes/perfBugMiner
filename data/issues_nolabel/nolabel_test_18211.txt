freeze_graph.py generates error messages when run on sample model (census / wide_deep)

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.6.0-0-gd2e24b6039', '1.6.0')
Python version: Python 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
CUDA/cuDNN version: Not using GPU
GPU model and memory: Not using GPU
Exact command to reproduce:
Follow the "wide_deep" tutorial
Try to freeze the generated model by running:
python freeze_graph.py
--input_graph=/tmp/census_model/graph.pbtxt
--input_checkpoint=/tmp/census_model/model.ckpt-190
--output_graph=/tmp/census_model/frozen_graph.pb
--output_node_names=softmax

An error is generated:
TypeError: names_to_saveables must be a dict mapping string names to Tensors/Variables. Not a variable: Tensor("dnn/hiddenlayer_0/bias:0", shape=(100,), dtype=float32)
Describe the problem
I would think that the freeze_graph script should finish successfully, hence I believe the problem is that an error message is generated.
