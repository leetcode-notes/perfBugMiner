Inconsistent tensor shapes in documentation for tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss

Hi,
In the documentation for tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss (as viewed here) it says the equivalent full softmax probabilities can be computed using tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(inputs, weights) + biases). However, under 'Args' it also states that inputs has shape batch_size, dim and weights has shape [num_classes, dim] â€” The dimensions of these tensors are incompatible for matrix multiplication.
I suspect that the actual equivalent operation would be something like tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights)) + biases) but I'm not 100% sure.
