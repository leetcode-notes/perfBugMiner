update dnn.py to clarify outputs arg to predict fn

It is unclear what the valid values are for predict(). Since the 2 variants are predict_classes and predict_proba, it's easy to think that the valid values are "classes" and "proba", which is untrue.
I think I've listed all the relevant values for DNNClassifier -- at least that's what the error msg told me when I used "proba" as my arg :D
