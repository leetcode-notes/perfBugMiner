tf.Print supports Variable

CF #14788, #14874
I agree that it might be not a good idea to pass Variable as input_ for tf.Print, and the implementation might be incomplete, incorrect or even potentially dangerous.  So feel free to close the pr.
As we knwon, tf.Print is consistent with tf.identity, which always return a Tensor with the same type. However, the pr changes tf.Print's behavior as:

return Tensor for Tensor.
return mutable Tensor for mutable Tensor.
return Variable for Variable.

The pr is opposed to #15069.
