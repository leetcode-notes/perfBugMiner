Dependency required for user Reader ops?

When creating a Reader op inside core/user_ops that inherits from ReaderBase, Bazel responds with
tensorflow/core/BUILD:325:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//tensorflow/core:user_ops_op_lib':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/core/user_ops/user_reader_op.cc':
  'bazel-out/local_darwin-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/core/kernels/reader_base.pb.h'.

Is this because the user_ops_op_lib depends only on framework? user_reader_op.cc includes reader_base.h which includes reader_base.pb.h. What dependency should I add to make this work? I'm still figuring out Bazel atm.
This is with latest source code.
