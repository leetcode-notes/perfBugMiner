[Feature Request] Control the progress of Iterator.get_next()

I just noticed that Iterator.get_next() did not change my batch samples in a tf.while_loop.
However, I'd like to run the training operation in a tf.while_loop, so I need to control the progress of Iterator.get_next() directly.
My Feature Request:
It would be cool, if Iterator would provide an operation which can be called to advance its state.
