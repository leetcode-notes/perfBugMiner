Describe the problem
DNNClassifier doesn't appear to have any methods for freeing its resources, and that doesn't seem to occur automatically if I let the classifier go out of scope.
In the gist linked above, I train, evaluate, and throw away DNNClassifiers as part of a genetic algorithm for feature selection, but after training a little more than a hundred models, it fails:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to get matching files on ./model_2017-10-18-21:41:26/125/model.ckpt-4000: Resource exhausted: ./model_2017-10-18-21:41:26/125
