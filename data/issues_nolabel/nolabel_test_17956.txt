Operation missing on iOS despite being added to tf_op_files.txt and ops_to_register.h

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.13.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.7.0-rc1
Python version: 2.7.10
Bazel version (if compiling from source): bazel release 0.11.1-homebrew
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
I believe it's a bug. We're trying to run a TensorFlow model on an iOS app by performing the steps described in the official docs. I've previously successfully built and ran this graph and its related libraries on Android.
We build the libraries like this:
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh -a arm64 -g our_inference_graph.pb

We make sure the operations in question (fft_ops.cc) are built:


tensorflow/core/framework/ops_to_register.h contains || isequal(op, "RFFT")


android_extended_ops_group1 in tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD contains fft_ops.cc


tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_op_files.txt contains tensorflow/core/kernels/fft_ops.cc


The fft object file is built as tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/obj/fft_ops.o


However, we get the following error when loading the graph:
2018-03-23 13:04:06.618259: E tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1197] OpKernel ('op: "RFFT" device_type: "CPU"') for unknown op: RFFT

Here's my question on SO (no repsonse): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49452489/opkernel-op-rfft-device-type-cpu-for-unknown-op-rfft
Related issues: issues #15921 and #5518 suggest adding the operation to tf_op_files.txt, which we've done (see above).
