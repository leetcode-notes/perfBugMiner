Allow creating global tf.FIFOQueue in deep frame contexts

Let's say I'm building a graph. It's a pretty deep graph with many nested while loops. Let's also say I have some template/abstraction that allows me to create a tf.FIFOQueue on demand deep in my nested while loops as I encounter things I want to send out of the graph. This template allows me to infer the shape automatically from the tensors as they are encountered rather than to have to write a bunch of painful boilerplate to define all the queues and their corresponding shapes up-front.
This is currently not possible with TensorFlow, because this gives this error:

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: The node 'fifo_queue_DequeueMany' has inputs from different frames. The input 'while/fifo_queue' is in frame 'while/while/'. The input 'fifo_queue_DequeueMany/n' is in frame ''.

I want to create a FIFOQueue() in the global "frame" so I don't get this error. In addition the documentation never explains what a "frame" even is. Having undocumented restrictions that suddenly explode without warning is a sign of leaky abstractions and very frustrating for users.
