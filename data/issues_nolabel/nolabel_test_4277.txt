Compilation of the C API in version 0.10

In version 0.10, the C API was moved from tensorflow/core to tensorflow/c. The master branch contains a commit adding a new target to tensorflow/BUILD for building the C API in the new location. However, this commit and the corresponding target are not present on branch r0.10. Iâ€™m wondering how one is supposed to build the C API in version 0.10. Thank you.
