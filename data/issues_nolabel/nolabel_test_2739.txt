Updating the setup web page for GPU to use primary with nvidia-docker then docker_run_gpu as alternative

Updating the website setup page to align with `tools/docker/README.md`` by adding description to use nvidia-docker first before trying docker_run_gpu script for GPU scenario.
Also fix minor grammar by add is when explaining the port mapping.
