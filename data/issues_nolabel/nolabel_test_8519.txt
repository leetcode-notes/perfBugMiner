error while building tensorflow from source

I am trying to install tensorflow from source and getting this error while building tensorflow from bazel using the command:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
and the error is:
`ERROR: /home/prakash/.cache/bazel/_bazel_prakash/8d51bbac70ad4d48b6548f0de307c16b/external/nccl_archive/BUILD.bazel:33:1: error while parsing .d file: /home/prakash/.cache/bazel/_bazel_prakash/8d51bbac70ad4d48b6548f0de307c16b/execroot/tensorflow/bazel-out/local_linux-py3-opt/bin/external/nccl_archive/_objs/nccl/external/nccl_archive/src/reduce.cu.pic.d (No such file or directory).

I have a Nvidia 720M graphic chip on my laptop is that causing the issue .? any advice would be helpful.
the configuration i did was this:
`prakash@prakash008:~/Downloads/tensorflow$ ./configure
