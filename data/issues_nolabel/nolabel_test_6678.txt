Installation from Source Error: "Server finished RPC without an explicit exit code"

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
GPU: NVIDIA Titan X
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1.5
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD) f64c288 (should be the latest one...)
The output of bazel version 0.4.3

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
When running "bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
", it reported "Server finished RPC without an explicit exit code" after a few minutes' running. The last few lines looks as follows:
...
[2,244 / 3,310] Linking tensorflow/core/libarray_ops_op_lib.pic.lo
Server finished RPC without an explicit exit code

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I managed to install tensorflow via pip installation, and everything is running correctly (ex. Tensorflow demo).
Does anyone has any suggestions? Thanks in advance! :-)
