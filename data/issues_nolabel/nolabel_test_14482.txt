[Fetaure Request] Bicubic interpolation using map coordinates

I would like to train a two CNN in single graph. The architecture of model is

This one is not like end to end training. In the warping of images(refer attachment), I use scipy for mapping coordinates from the disparity map to an input image and I am unable to build a model(graph) in tensorflow using scipy. Tensorflow supports only resize of images using bicubic/bilinear interpolation. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.interpolation.map_coordinates.html
For reference, original paper is implemented using matconvnet in matlab.
