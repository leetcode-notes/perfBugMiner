I think your linux python3.5 1.2rc whl is actually installing TF 1.1.0, the Python 3.6 one works

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.2.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
TensorFlow version (use command below):
was trying to install 1.2rc but got 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0
GPU model and memory:
Titan X
Exact command to reproduce:

THIS CREATES THE PROBLEM:
source activate tfpy35
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.2.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> print(tf.__version__)
1.1.0
IT SHOULD BE 1.2.0-RC1

THIS WORKS:
conda create --name tensorflow python=3
source activate tensorflow
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.2.0rc1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
python
>>> import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)
1.2.0-rc1

Describe the problem
I am using anaconda and created a py3.5 env
I installed TF GPU as per https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/install/install_linux#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package
for python 3.5
But when I run python then import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version)
I get 1.1.0
If I do exactly the same thing but create a python 3 enviornment and then load the 3.6 gpu whl it works
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
