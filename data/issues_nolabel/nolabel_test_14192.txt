Dockerfile.gpu: use the runtime cuDNN v6 image

The generated Docker image will be approximately 900 MB smaller.
The Dockerfile switched to the devel image a long time ago to
workaround a bug when looking up CUDA libraries. This problem has been
fixed in the meantime.
@gunan let me know if I'm missing something and there is a good reason to keep the devel image as a base.
