rename var mu to learning_rate

Trying to resolve some problems with commit...done
Rename variable mu to learing_rate for paper consistency.
This is a second try, first try I have broke the file somehow (some waste lines leaked in it in merge commits). Now I have updated my local master branch from remote master, made a new branch for just this commit and made one commit ahead master. Hope it will be ok now.
