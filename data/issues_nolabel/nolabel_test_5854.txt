std::system_error after tensor flow install

As suggested from stack overflow, i move this issue here.
I installed tensorflow in a virtual environment via pip (Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, CPU only, Python 2.7), and tried to run the test example:
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()

I get:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'
what():  Resource temporarily unavailable
Aborted

I've looked around for the common troubleshooting with no success. Any ideas where to start?
