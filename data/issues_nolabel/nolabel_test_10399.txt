export step of Experiment fails in python 3.5 (likely due to string-type mismatch)

System information

Describe the problem
When running Experiment stuff, it works fine in 2.7 but breaks in 3.5. From what I can tell, it's happening in gc.py, which is being called after the model has been exported and everything is done.
My best guess from looking at similar bugs on SO is that there's a mismatch somewhere between 'byte' strings and python strings, possibly because the base folder path of the export is generated (e.g. /exports/Servo/123456789/saved_model.py), so the somehow the concat isn't happy with this.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
