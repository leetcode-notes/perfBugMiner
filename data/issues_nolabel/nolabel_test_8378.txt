Issue running LabelImage.java demo.

Below is the error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is not available in GraphDef version 21. It has been removed in version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().

I can't find the source file in which to use tf.nn.batch_normalization
Are the Java libraries using older versions of Tensorflow?
