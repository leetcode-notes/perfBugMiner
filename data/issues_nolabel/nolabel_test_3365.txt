Remove read_analogies() from word2vec class initialization

Fix inconsistent between word2vec and word2vec_optimized.
Remove read_analogies() from word2vec class initialization.

When I used word2vec model for training my target words directly, it lacked of analogies file for evaluation. Thus, it would raise file not found exception when model initialization. So I made read_analogies() public and called it after initialization.
