eigen-eigen issue

Hi,
I am trying to compile an example with C++ api, and I'm running into this issue:

I do not seem to have an "eigen-eigen-334b1d428283" folder anywhere.
There's an eigen.BUILD file at the root level, but I am unable to bazel it with
bazel build eigen
nor
bazel build tensorflow/eigen
(but it should be the first one, isn't it? eigen.BUILD being at the root level... Or how does bazel work in this respect?)
Should I build that file via bazel? I guess I should. (but how do I build in general a xxxx.BUILD file, given that bazel build xxxx doesn't work?)
Thanks a lot,
daniele
