Add sparse_transpose wrapper

Attempt to add transpose function for SparseTensor as mentioned in #2180.
The commented code is an attempt to use tf.reverse to reverse indices and shape. But right now it raises error since reverse doesn't support int64.
I did test the changes locally. This is my first attempt to contribute. Please let me know if I have to do something here. Thanks.
