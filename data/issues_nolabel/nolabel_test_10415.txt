ValueError: Attempt to have a second RNNCell use the weights of a variable scope that already has weights:

'generator/rnn_cell/rnn/basic_rnn_cell'; and the cell was not constructed as BasicRNNCell(..., reuse=True).  To share the weights of an RNNCell, simply reuse it in your second calculation, or create a new one with the argument reuse=True.
