[cmake] CPU only build error in tf_stream_executor.cmake

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master
Python version: N/A, building with cmake
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A, building with cmake
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:
cd tensorflow/contrib/cmake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="../bin" ..

Describe the problem
cmake build fails when
option(tensorflow_ENABLE_GPU "Enable GPU support" OFF)
with following error:
.../tensorflow-master/tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.h:32:30: fatal error: cuda/cuda_config.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
Source code / logs
Pretty sure that the issue lies in this commit:
f1582cf#diff-1d799fa350437420218e5e5aa680c481
in CMakeLists.txt the line
"  include_directories(${tensorflow_source_dir}/third_party/gpus)"
is still under tensorflow_ENABLE_GPU
Which is why dso_loader cannot find cuda_config.h
On the other hand, I suppose it should not use this include at all in the CPU mode.
