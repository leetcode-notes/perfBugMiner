The problem
I noticed that a huge amount of training time CPU is idle. I isolated the problem to the code snippet bellow, where I create a string tensor using tf.constant with N rows each of them contains comma separated list of randomly generated numberical values, then I decode these string tensor to rank2 tensor of floats using 3 different approaches.
I discovered following:
decoding tfrecords with tf.parse_example is quite fast
decoding csv with decode_csv is ~20 (4 cores) 60 (16 cores) times slower than parse_example and it utilises only 1 core on my machine
decoding csv with tf.string_split + tf.string_to_number() is ~20-60 times slower than parse_example.
It seems tf.string_to_number() makes it slow, if I comment out the line with tf.string_to_number it is 2-3 times slower than parse example
The code I used for that:
