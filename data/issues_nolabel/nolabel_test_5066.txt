Multiple GPU Memory Being Allocated for single device script

I am unable to run a TF script on a single GPU. Both of my GTX 1080's memory are being fully absorbed by Tensorflow when the model is initialized, but only one of the GPU is being used for computations (based on what I'm seeing in nvidia-smi).
Because both GPUs memory are fully occupied, I cannot run two models at once.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I'm using the example from here: https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/convolutional_network.py
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
and
config = tf.ConfigProto(
device_count = {'GPU': 1}
)
sess = tf.Session(config=config)
and
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
