Ubuntu 16.04

On Ubuntu 16.04 (gcc default is 5.3),
apt-get install cuda-toolkit installs the library files in usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
tensorflow prefers them in usr/local/cuda
.configure allows you to change the directory
cuDNN installs in /usr/local/cuda (more or less by default)
telling configure that cuDNN is in usr/local/cuda makes tf look for cuda in usr/local/cuda
Before you know it, you have cuda versions, nvidia versions, cuda folders etc. all over the place but tf not knowing any GPU!!
