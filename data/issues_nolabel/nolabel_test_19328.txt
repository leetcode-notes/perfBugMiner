Fix issue in Keras model complie with float64 mode

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #19318 where Keras model complie for model.compile('rmsprop', 'mse') does not work in float64 mode.
The issue comes from placeholder_with_default([1.]..., which returns dtype float32 by default (as [1.] was inteprated as float32). Since placeholder_with_default does not have a output_dtype to pass, this fix converts [1.] to float64 first before passing in to address the issue. A test case has been added to cover the changes.
This fix fixes #19318.
