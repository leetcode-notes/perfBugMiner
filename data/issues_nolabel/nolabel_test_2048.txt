Input to reshape is a tensor with 4889 values, but the requested shape has 4800

Operating System:Ubuntu 14.04
1.I fixed my images to 200*200 .jpg,and stored into TFRecord file
2.I read TFR file and try to train in cifar10 model,it raised error:
Input to reshape is a tensor with 4889 values, but the requested shape has 4800
on :depth_major = tf.reshape(image,[result.depth, result.height, result.width])
It seems cause of diffrent of images' buffer size?
Should I  fix the sizes before put into TFR file?
