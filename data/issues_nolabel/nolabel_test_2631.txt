error building py package in format of tar.gz

OS: OS X Yosemite 10.10.4
After installation of dependencies, I build it as following cmds:
delete bdist_wheel in tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.sh
${PYTHON_BIN_PATH:-python} setup.py bdist_wheel >/dev/null to ${PYTHON_BIN_PATH:-python} setup.py


bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

sh +x tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.sh /tmp

then I got the package named tensorflow-0.8.0.tar.gz, after that I installed it using pip, succeed.
However, when I imported it, I got the error:
>>> import tensorflow as tf
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named tensorflow

Could anybody help me? Any help will be highly appreciated.
Could staff in Google build it or give some valuable instructions?
