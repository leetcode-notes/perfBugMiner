Getting more done in GitHub with ZenHub

Hola! @watermelonboss has created a ZenHub account for the tensorflow organization. ZenHub is the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub – created specifically for fast-moving, software-driven teams.

How do I use ZenHub?
To get set up with ZenHub, all you have to do is download the browser extension and log in with your GitHub account. Once you do, you’ll get access to ZenHub’s complete feature-set immediately.
What can ZenHub do?
ZenHub adds a series of enhancements directly inside the GitHub UI:

Real-time, customizable task boards for GitHub issues;
Multi-Repository burndown charts, estimates, and velocity tracking based on GitHub Milestones;
Personal to-do lists and task prioritization;
Time-saving shortcuts – like a quick repo switcher, a “Move issue” button, and much more.
