Feature request: automatically pick all defaults in ./configure

Everytime a new configuration option is added my CI halts on the ./configure step as it's prompted for input. Instead of setting each flag could we have some USE_DEFAULTS=1 ./configure flag instead?
I assume the intention is to slowly move away from the shell script to something better (hence configure.py, I wager) but for now, when testing projects with the master release it would be very useful to be able to just pick all default options for the WORKSPACE without knowing about them.
