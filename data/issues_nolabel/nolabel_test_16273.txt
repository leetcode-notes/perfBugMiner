Add test for float16 support with conv1d and update docstring

The float16 support for conv1d has already been in place. However there was no test for float16 with conv1d. This fix adds test case to cover float16 support with conv1d.
In addition, float64 support with conv1d is not possible because conv1d calls conv2d, which in turn does not support float64 yet (See #12941, #13097, and #12943)
The previous docstring incorrectly claimed float64 support with conv1d.
This fix also updates related docstring to remove float64 part.
