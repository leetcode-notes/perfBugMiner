Fix broken links in /extend/language_bindings

This PR is to fix broken links in TensorFlow in other languages.

As we can see in above api guides as below, the [ tensorflow/core/ops/ops.pbtxt ] should link to a cite link of https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/ops/ops.pbtxt according to the cite reference link in the end of the doc but it didn't.
The issue here is citation reference will not work on tensorflow.org when the citation text contains "`".

Remove the last two citation reference link since they are never referenced anywhere.
