Fix tf.variable_scope unique name after entering root scope

This PR fixes a bug in creating unique scope name after entering and closing the root scope.
The following snippet exploits the bug
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope(None, "Block") as scope:
    print("SCOPE:" + scope.name)
with tf.variable_scope('') as scope:
    print("SCOPE:" + scope.name)
with tf.variable_scope(None, "Block") as scope:
    print("SCOPE:" + scope.name)
Executing it produces
    SCOPE:Block
    SCOPE:
    SCOPE:Block

While the expected behavior should be
    SCOPE:Block
    SCOPE:
    SCOPE:Block_1

As it turns out, closing the root scope ('') results in resetting the dict self.variable_scopes_count to 0,
since not '' evaluates to True, which is unlikely the required behavior.
