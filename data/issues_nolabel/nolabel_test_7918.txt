Add support for loading specific frame from SequenceExample

Hi,
I have converted my video dataset into TFRecords format by storing each video as a SequenceExample. The problem is I don't neccesarily need to load all frames of a video instead of 2 random frames. Is there any plan to add support for loading specific frame from a SequenceExample to save loading time?  Or is there any method I can use to speed up loading?
