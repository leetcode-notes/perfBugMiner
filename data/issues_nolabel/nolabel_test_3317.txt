handling multiple graphs

In numerous locations in the documentation, it has been mentioned that it is possible to handle multiple Graphs, but I couldn't find any example.
Since Session only support a single Graph, it seems the only way of doing it is to create multiple Session instances.
Is it safe to have multiple instances Session at the same time?
if not, what is the proper way of handling multiple Graphs?
Thanks
