System hangs while training

Hi everyone,
I am trying to train model for handwritten digits. My data consists of images, each of size 80X80. So I get 6400 features as inputs.
While trying to train model as per code used in https://www.kaggle.com/kakauandme/digit-recognizer/tensorflow-deep-nn, my systems hangs after 200 iterations with training accuracy 0.06.
Why is this happening? I don't get any errors. My system just freezes.
Also, how do I set pooling and convolution layers parameters?
PS: I'm not using GPU.
