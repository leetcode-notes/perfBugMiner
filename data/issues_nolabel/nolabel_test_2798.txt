add support for nesterov momentum

#594

I use an indirect way. After every minimal step, var will be var_true - lr * momentum * accum, so we need to recover to var_true before compute new var.
I find it's difficult to implement  nesterov momentum in a direct way due to the code structure of minimal step.
The first commit only include dense nesterov momentum, I'll add sparse version and docs.
The code will not pass test currently becase of accuracy problem of tf.half.
Anyone has a better suggestion?
