Move Torch to TensorFlow

Hi, I try to translate a torch code to TensorFlow, but I cannot find the corresponding tensorflow function of SpatialFullConvolution which is able to apply transpose convoluation on vector (not only image).
How can I deal with it?
here is an example https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch/blob/master/main.lua
