node placement algorithm in the source code?

I have read the whitepaper and felt very excited about the node placement algorithm decribed in section 3.2, so I tried to figure out the details from the source code. However, I cannot find the files that implement this algorithm.
I have read the tensorflow/core/common_runtime/Simple_placer.h (& Simple_placer.cc) and it seems it's too "simple" to cover the algorithm descibed in the whitepaper. Other files like tensorflow/core/graph/Graph_partition.h (& Graph_partition.cc) didn't have that algorithm neither. And the costmodel implemented in tensorflow/core/graph/Costmodel.h (& Costmodel.cc), I cannot find their caller in other place.
Someone please help me?
