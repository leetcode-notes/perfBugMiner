Center loss

It seems that center loss seems good in the recognition area to minize the variation of cluter. There is a caffe implementation of this loss.

I wrote some code but it seems not correct:
def center_loss(features, labels, name):
    with tf.name_scope(name=name):
       feat_dim = features.get_shape().as_list()[1]
       batch_size = features.get_shape().as_list()[0]
       centers = tf.get_variable('center', shape=[FLAGS.num_classes, feat_dim])
       # compute loss & update center
       loss = 0
       for i in range(batch_size):
           ft = features[i, :]
           idx = labels[i]
           c = tf.gather(centers, idx)
          loss += tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(tf.sub(ft, c)))
      loss /= batch_size
Is there can help me to understand better with Tensorflow, I can make a PR.
