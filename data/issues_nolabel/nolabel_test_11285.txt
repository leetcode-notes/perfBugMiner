Fix quantization tutorial

Fix this tutorial on quantization.


Remove outdated dependencies, as pointed out in #10463.


The change made in #10592 was incomplete. The example on how to run transform_graph to quantize a graph should follow this tutorial about graph_transforms, but the argument --inputs='Mul' is missing.


@petewarden I'm also wondering when/how will the tutorial on tensorflow.org get updated? I'm assuming it should be the same as quantization.md that I'm fixing?
Related to #11181.
Thanks!
