Missing Numerous models in TF-Slim from Tensorflow/models

Hello dear friends,
If you have a look to: tensorflow/tensorflow =>/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets, you may notice that numerous models are missing:

cifarnet.py
cyclegan.py
dcgan.py
inception_resnet_v2.py
lenet.py
mobilenet_v1.py
pix2pix.py
nasnet/nasnet.py
nasnet/pnasnet.py
mobilenet/mobilenet.py  # Might be redundant with mobilenet_v1.py
mobilenet/mobilenet_v2.py

All of them are available here : tensorflow/models =>/research/slim/nets
Why some of them are given with TF and not the others ?
Have a nice day,
Jonathan
