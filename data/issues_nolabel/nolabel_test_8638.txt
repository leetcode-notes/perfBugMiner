Support pandas Series and DataFrame as input for tf.constant

This fix tries to address the proposal raised in #2318 to support pandas Series and DataFrame as input for tf.constant.
As was explained in #2318, Series and DataFrame has __array__ method, which is the standard API used for indicating that an object is coercible into NumPy arrays.
This fix adds the support for objects with __array__ to be served as input for tf.constant.
This fix fixes #2318.
