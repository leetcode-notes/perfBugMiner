eager execution not working with placeholders

System information

Have I written custom code: Yes:
OS Platform and Distribution (Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (binary):
TensorFlow version (1.7):
Python version (3.6):
CUDA/cuDNN version (9.0/7.0.):
GPU model and memory (1080 Ti):

Describe the problem
I get the following error when I use eager execution on a simple graph with a couple of convolutional layers.
tf.placeholder() is not compatible with eager execution

Does that mean that eager execution is not working with placeholders. That would be useful to have since if have older code constructed using graphs and sessions we won't be able to utilize eager execution for debugging purposes.
