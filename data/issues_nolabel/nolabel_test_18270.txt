why the kfac in tensorflow is not working suddenly?

Hi,
I wrote a simple code using tf.contrib.kfac for regression. It worked fine in the last two weeks. However, when I tried to run the code again the day before yesterday, there was an error:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib' has no attribute 'kfac'

I just don't know why suddenly this goes wrong. Can anyone help me?
Thanks so much.
