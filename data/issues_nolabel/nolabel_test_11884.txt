Bazel build failure with gpu version

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.2.0, I'm installing from tha master branch
Python version:
2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.5.3
CUDA/cuDNN version:
5.1
GPU model and memory:
GTX1060 6G
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I followed every step from the installing & configuration page at tf official website. But when I came the bazel build step, I ran into the problem showed in the error logs below.
I should mention that:

I choosed cuda support in the ./configure step, you can find the configure details below as well.
I previously installed the cpu version of tensorflow on the same computer and it worked fine. Now I've uninstalled it of course.

Source code / logs
My configuration:
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]: 
Found possible Python library paths:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with jemalloc as malloc support? [Y/n]: 
jemalloc as malloc support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N]: 
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [y/N]: 
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]: 
No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with VERBS support? [y/N]: 
No VERBS support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL support? [y/N]: 
No OpenCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 8.0]: 
Please specify the location where CUDA 8.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: 
"Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]: 5
Please specify the location where cuDNN 5 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size. [Default is: 6.1]
Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]: 
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]: 
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: 
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: 
Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the environment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.
Configuration finished


My command which introduced the error below:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
