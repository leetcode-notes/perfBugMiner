Very Slow Run time on A Pre Trained Network - Inception V1

System information

example script (Very Similar label_Image.py but simpler):

TensorFlow version (1.3):
Python version - 3.5.3:

Describe the problem
I encountered a disturbing issue regarding the run time for processing an arbitrary image through an inception V1/GoogleNet pre-trained model the runtime took approximately 9.2 ms
When using the same image and exactly the same model with Caffe, It was running X4 faster than Tensorflow (2.3 ms).  The models  I used (both for Caffe and Tensorflow)  :
beniz/deepdetect#89
Labels file is attached.
How is it even possible ?!?!
Am I doing something incorrectly ?
By the way, I carefully checked (with GPU-Z) and it seems Tensorflow  properly uses the GPU resources.
Source code / logs
Attahced, along with the used label file.
In order to use the (python) script, simply put it in the same folder as the model and label file., and rename it to :  TF_Running_Inception.py
TF_Running_Inception.txt
imagenet_slim_labels.txt
