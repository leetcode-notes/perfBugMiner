AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'inv'

Hi there,
I have an issue when I am trying to inverse a tensor as shown below



import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
tf.inv(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'inv'



Operation System: mac os x 10.11.6
Python 2.7.13
I installed tensor flow using pip install tensorflow



tf.version
'0.12.1'



If someone could help out, that would be cool! Thanks!
