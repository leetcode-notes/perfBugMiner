Update 1_notmnist.ipynb

I'm learning Tensorflow on the Udacity,and while I flow the course to test code,I found that the url in Update 1_notmnist.ipynb is wrong,it can't be open.After a while,I found the url in the video is different from the one in the file,so I pause the vedio and remenber the url.This url is ok and it pass the test perfectly. Thx for ur attention.
