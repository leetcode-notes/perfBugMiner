InvalidArgumentError (traceback): BiasGrad requires tensor size <= int32 max in 3D CNN, Tensorflow

I am using 3D CNN model in tensorflow. My input image dimension is 3D i.e. (192 * 256 * 256) with one color channel image and i have used three Convolutional layers (with patches of 5 * 5 * 5) and 3 pooling layers (kernal size : 3 * 3 * 3 and stride : 2 * 2 * 2), one full-connection-layer with 128 nodes and output layer with two nodes. The number of samples are 120 for training. Batch size : 10
I am facing the below error on the cluster:
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
