archive.openswitch.net ssl cert path fails when installing syntaxnet.

Hey guys,
We've been using your default bazel shell script, https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.2.2b/bazel-0.2.2b-installer-linux-x86_64.sh for a while to create a syntaxnet docker image for internal use, and it's been working great. However recently (past couple of days) we've tried a rebuild that started failing with the following error message:
ERROR: /tmp/tensorflow/models/syntaxnet/tensorflow/tensorflow/workspace.bzl:84:3: no such package '@gmock_archive//': Error downloading from https://archive.open
switch.net/gmock-1.7.0.zip to /tmp/bazel/external/gmock_archive: Error downloading https://archive.openswitch.net/gmock-1.7.0.zip to /tmp/bazel/external/gmock_ar
chive/gmock-1.7.0.zip: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable t
o find valid certification path to requested target and referenced by '//external:gtest'.

From quick inspection, it looks like the ssl cert path failed for https://archive.openswitch.net within the bazel build operation, IE it might have a self-signed certificate.
This is a brand new bug for us with no changes to our image or infrastructure, which makes us think that it's related specifically to the external file hosting you guys have designated in the shell script.
Let me know if you need any other information to help
Thanks,
James
