Argmax, fetching top 5 probabilities

I'm having an issue with computing the accuracy of my model. I want to see if the top 5 predictions contains the actual label when comparing against the test set.
correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(activation, 1), tf.argmax(y, 1))
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, "float"))
print ("ACCURACY IS:")
print sess.run(accuracy, feed_dict={x: data.test_set.inputs(), y: data.test_set.targets()})

From what I've read in the documentation TensorFlow doesn't seem to have something like fetching the top 5 from activation and seeing if one of the items is contained in argmax(y,1)
Something like this would be nice:
correct_prediction = tf.contains(tf.argmax(activation, dim, N_VALUES_TO_FETCH), tf.argmax(y, dim)

Can anyone help me with the problem I am facing? Thank you.
