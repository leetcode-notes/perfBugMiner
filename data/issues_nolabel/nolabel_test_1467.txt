Allow suppressing log output

Two recent requests recently to suppress logging on console 1, 2
Since TensorFlow uses Google logging library standard flags should work, ie "export GLOG_logtostderr=0" should turn off logging to console. However that doesn't work, I suspect these flags are explicitly overriden in code somewhere
