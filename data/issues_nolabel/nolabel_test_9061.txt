Tensorflow Training Freezes for sometime, then continue on its own, happen multiple times when training a model

I recently upgraded to Tensorflow 0.12.1, Python3, Ubuntu 14.04, Cuda 8.0, Cudnn 5.1
Then I run my old code written for Tensorflow 0.10.1, which is a simple sequence-to-sequence model. And the training keeps freeze in the middle.
After some time the training will continue normally. Sometimes it 1 or 2 minutes, and sometimes it takes about 5 to 6 hours.
Anyone has opinion on how to trouble-shoot this?
