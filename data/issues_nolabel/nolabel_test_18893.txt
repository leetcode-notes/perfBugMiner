Exact command to reproduce: use slim.batch_norm
Describe the problem
normalization_layers.BatchNormalization takes an argument virtual_batch_size that tells the layer to use "Ghost Batch Normalization", which creates virtual sub-batches which are each normalized separately.
slim.batch_norm doesn't expose this argument. is there a way to use ghost BN with slim?
Thanks.
