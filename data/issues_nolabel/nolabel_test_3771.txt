Please consolidate the builder API's

In my opinion, a simple builder API is essential to TensorFlow programming because the procedure of constructing Neural Networks is otherwise complicated, repetitive and error-prone. But there are at least 5 different builder API's being developed in parallel:

tf.contrib.layers
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/layers
tf.contrib.slim
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim
tf.contrib.learn (aka. TF Learn)
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn
TF Learn (same name, but apparently different from the above):
https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn
Pretty Tensor
https://github.com/google/prettytensor

All of these add-on packages seem to be more or less in the early stages of development and lacking good documentation. But the API's appear to be very similar. So why not consolidate them into a single builder API that can become an integrated part of TensorFlow? It is very confusing for new users the way it is done now, and the development would get much further if people would work on a single builder API rather than 5 almost identical ones. The builder API is how most people will use TensorFlow so it shouldn't be in limbo like this.
Furthermore, I'm trying to put together some tutorials on YouTube, but I'm concerned that the API I'm using (Pretty Tensor) might become deprecated at some point.
I hope that a consolidated and official builder API will receive more attention from the dev-team.
Thanks!
