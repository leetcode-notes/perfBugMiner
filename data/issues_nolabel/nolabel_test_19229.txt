[Intel MKL] Fix for convrnn unit test failure

Adding a fixup pass (+unit test) to handle incorrectly linked Mkl metadata
edges
This graph pass is needed because a graph may have some input Mkl metadata
edges incorrectly setup after node merge and rewrite passes. This could
happen because GetReversePostOrder function may not provide a topologically
sorted order if a graph contains cycles.
Minor style issue left over from earlier commits to the graph pass are also
handled (but not related to the fixup pass).
