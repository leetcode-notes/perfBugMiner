PIC flag for Makefile-built Android Static Library

Currently if we build a shared lib with ndk = r12b and android-api = 21, and the shared lib is linking Makefile-built tensorflow android static library, the android ndk hints that the tensorflow and nsync lib is not complied with -fPIC option, this PR fix the problem. It only impacts the android build.
