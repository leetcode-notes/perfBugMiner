TypeError: strided_slice() takes at least 4 arguments (3 given)

I have check the error.  And I find that the bug has been fixed in github code.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py
lastest github version:
def strided_slice(input_, begin, end, strides=None,
lastest whl version:
def strided_slice(input_, begin, end, strides,
However tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl doesn't  synchronize with github.
How can I upgrade tensorflow from lastest github code?
