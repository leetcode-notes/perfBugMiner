documentation on how to use a Tensorflow model trained using the Estimator & Dataset APIs on an Android app.

I am having a hard time finding documentation on how to use a Tensorflow model trained using the Estimator & Dataset APIs on an Android app.
Having spent hours searching for it and turned out nothing, and maybe there's a many others having the same issue, and the answer could be just a two-minutes thing for people who knows. I am raising it as an issue here.
Can someone point me to a good reference and/or tutorial? I looked at the TensorflowInferenceInterface, but my understanding is it need you to specify which operator you want to feed the input to, but the Estimator/Dataset abstraction is at another level. So I am somewhat lost here.
Thanks.

The version of Tensorflow I am using is v1.6.0-0-gd2e24b6039 1.6.0
