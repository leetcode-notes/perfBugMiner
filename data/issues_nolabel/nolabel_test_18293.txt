[XLA/AOT] Build LLVM with Bazel on Windows

I previously use hacky BUILD file to import prebuilt LLVM binaries from CMake to Bazel so that I can build tfcompile with Bazel on Windows, but since Tensorflow updates the LLVM revision used very frequently, this method is too troublesome.
I am trying to make XLA/AOT to work out-of-the-box on Windows with Bazel, then convince Tensorflow team to create a presubmit so that no one can break XLA/AOT on Windows anymore.
Summary:

Remove unused llvm_host_triple.
Rename cmake_vars to posix_cmake_vars and create a new win32_cmake_vars as Windows is sufficiently different from other platforms.
Create LLVM_DEFINES, LLVM_COPTS and LLVM_LINKOPTS in llvm.bzl to set global compile/link flags for LLVM.
Create macro llvm_cc_library that wrap around cc_library to ensure that all targets receive LLVM_COPTS consistently. Replace all cc_library with llvm_cc_library.
For support library, include lib/Support/Windows/* for Windows and lib/Support/Unix/* for others.

If llvm.BUILD is not to be edited manually no matter what, can the script used to generate llvm.BUILD be open-sourced?
