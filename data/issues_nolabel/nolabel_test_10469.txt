Export C API symbols in _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so

This PR exports C API symbols so that python extension libraries can use the C API.
As noted in #7541, there is currently a conflict between _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so and libtensorflow.so. This conflict prevents use of the tensorflow C API and the python API in the same process. This PR attempts to implement a workaround suggested by @jhseu by exporting the C API symbols in the python library, so that the Python and C APIs are both available from the single _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so.
