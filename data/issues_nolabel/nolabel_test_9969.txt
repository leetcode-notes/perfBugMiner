tensorflow-gpu crashes without libcuda.so

I'm on a multi-machine cluster where not all the machines have gpus. Previously with 0.11 I could use one tensorflow-gpu installation (either from source or from the provided wheel) on all the machines. I've now upgraded to 1.1, and tensorflow crashes at import on the non-gpu machines:
ImportError: libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

My current workaround is to have different tensorflows (cpu or gpu) in different conda environments and load the conda environment based on whether I need to use a gpu or not.
