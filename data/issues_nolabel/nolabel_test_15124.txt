XLA Reshape_test failing for 3rd party platforms

I have opened a discussion on the XLA dev mailing list, but I think that this counts as an issue since if it isn't fixed then potentially all XLA tests will migrate to being unusable for 3rd party devices.

The issue is that the code in reshape_test.cc assumes that any devices which are not CPU/CPU_PARALLEL/GPU will use the bfloat16 format.  This isn't true for the Graphcore device.
