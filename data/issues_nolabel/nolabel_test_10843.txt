Compiling tensorflow fails with error: no matching function for call to 'Permute(tensorflow::gtl::ArraySlice<long long int>&, const std::vector<llvm::Value*, std::allocator<llvm::Value*> >&)'

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Trying to compile from source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0 release
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0.61/6.0.21
GPU model and memory: 1080 Ti 11 GB
Exact command to reproduce: The PKGBUILD https://paste.xinu.at/XaChkb/
If you are not familiar with this format, basically just execute prepare() and then build().

Describe the problem
I'm the packager for the official tensorflow package in Arch Linux and I was trying to update 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 and it fails to build. Full build log attached. We always build in clean chroots.
llvm 4.0, gcc 7.1.1
