Mention Julia API bindings

In several places, like here, API bindings for other languages are mentioned. It would be nice to mention the Julia bindings, which are now fairly stable and are actively used by many people.
It appears much of the website content comes from this repo but I can't find that page to make a PR. Would greatly appreciate a pointer to the right place for this.
