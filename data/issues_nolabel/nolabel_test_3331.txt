Retrofitting: idgi make me smarter :)

can someone point me to some info on retrofitting?  I don't get it really.
I'm specifically trying to combine some of my writing with ConceptNet (which I can download in matrix form) in order to generate output that sounds something like me or at least talks about the things i talk about.  Guess I'm not understanding how to align and combine the matrices for the most part but any literature is greatly appreciated.
Cheers,

p.s. bless you
