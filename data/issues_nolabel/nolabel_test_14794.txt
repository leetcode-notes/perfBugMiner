Remove `non-fused` version of `adjust_saturation` as GPU kernel already exists

In the existing implementation for adjust_saturation the non-fused version was still in place. As the non-fused is for non-GPU support of adjust_saturation and GPU kernel already exists now (See commit 25c4f27#diff-b53c223158b7c4fd248ef581da6566c2), it makes sense to remove the non-fused version.
In addition, with the removal of non-fused implementation of adjust_saturation, now it is possible to provide batch support (in 4-D instead of previous 3-D). This resolves issue raised in #8926.
This fix removed non-fused version of adjust_saturation and added additional test cases for batch support.
Note: In PR #14187, non-fused version of adjust_hue has been removed so batch support for adjust_hue has been enabled as well. This PR also adds additional test cases for batch support of adjust_hue.
