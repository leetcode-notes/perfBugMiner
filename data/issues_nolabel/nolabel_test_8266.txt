"The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3/SSE4.1/... instructions", "creating context when one is currently active", "Peer access not supported between device ordinals 0 and 1" when running "Hello TensorFlow"

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
I am running google TensorFlow on google compute engine instance. I started with Hello Tensorflow program and I am reading some warnings.

The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3/SSE4.1/SSE4.2/AVX/AVX2/FMA instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero.
creating context when one is currently active; existing: 0x30fd920
Peer access not supported between device ordinals 0 and 1

Can anyone tell me what caused those warnings? First thing I want to know is if my GPUs are actually working on the data are just sent to CPU only?
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried run the Hello TensorFlow on both instance with 4 GPUs and instance with 8GPUs.
