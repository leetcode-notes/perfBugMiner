Make CUDA library version numbers available from python

Hi!
Is it possible to make the versions of the CUDA libraries available as a python variable? Currently, after importing, there is the following output:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so.8.0 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.5.1.5 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcufft.so.8.0 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcuda.so.1 locally
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:108] successfully opened CUDA library libcurand.so.8.0 locally

So apparently the versioning information is loaded, I just couldn't find an API to access it.
I would like to record the CUDA as meta-information along with my checkpoint and event files, to be able to 100% reproduce any runs.
