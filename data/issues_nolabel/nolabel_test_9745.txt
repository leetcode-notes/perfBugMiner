Feature request: distance between each pair of the two collections of inputs. Analog of scipy.spatial.distance.cdist

is it possible to add a function to calculate a distance between each pair of the two collections of inputs. Scipy has it implemented in distance.sdist and supports many distance metrics.
Is it possible to have this function in TF? I have made an implementation for Eucledian distance but have no idea how to implement it for other metrics.
