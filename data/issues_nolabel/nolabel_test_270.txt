I have described the  error  in detail with all the output:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33772819/tensorflow-error-on-running-the-seq2seq-model
The other language model example is working and the library has also been built. As per comments I created the checkpoint directory , still throwing the same error: tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:1052] 0x400d2bbe0 Compute status: Not found: ./checkpoints_directory/translate.ckpt-200.tempstate9246663217899500702
