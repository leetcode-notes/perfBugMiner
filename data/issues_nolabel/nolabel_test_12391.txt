Implement L2Loss gradient.

This branch implements L2LossGrad, the gradient for L2Loss.
It is a port of the python implementation:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_grad.py
    
    
         Line 752
      in
      c0198fd
    
    
    
    

        
          
           def _L2LossGrad(op, grad): 
        
    
  


This is my first PR to TensorFlow. When giving feedback, please assume that I barely know what I'm doing.
Side question: I plan to do a few more gradients. Is it ok if I batch a few simple ones (like this one) into a single PR?
