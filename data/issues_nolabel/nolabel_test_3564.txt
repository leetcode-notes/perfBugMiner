Update index.md

I just test it as I want to assign a, b and c to gpu3. Something wrong happened.
if the code "c = tf.matmul(a, b)" is not include in "with tf.device('/cpu:0')", then even you find b and a are assigned to cpu0ï¼Œthey just be assigned default. Because c is assigned to cpu0 default. a and b are used by c, so they are assigned to cpu0.
