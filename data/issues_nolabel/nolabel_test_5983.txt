[Windows] TensorBoard doesn't work

I installed the tensorflow for windows with
pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
(I added the '--ignore-installed', for the official one didn't work on my pc)
Then I tried some code and ran tensorboard, however the browser shows nothing
When running with '--debug' there appears some 404.
I also tried tensorboard on mac os, it worked well, so the problem is not caused by the .tfevent file
I've read through a bunch of related issues, and found that maybe the pip install didn't install tensorflow completely. And I searched the tensorflow file and did not found some certain files appears in mac os tensorflow, such as 'paper-toolkit'
