tensorflow conv2d unexpected convolution result

I try to migrate a Caffe network and model(weights) to tensorflow. The original first layer is a stride one convolution on 1x128x128 gray image with kernel size 5x5, output channel 96, Caffe two padding, tf 'SAME' padding.
I checked the input image and kernel weights are the same for both versions.
However, the two's upper left corner of conv1's first feature map are different.
Only the leftmost column is consistent. I manually calculated and checked the results, the first and the second value of Caffe's (-0.71238005 -0.74042225) are correct according to the definition of convolution, the second value in tensorflow's (-0.71238005 -0.31195271) is incorrect. Taking into account the padding, the first value is from the 3x3 block of the image, the second should be the 3x4 block.
Is there any subtle difference in computation model between the two version's implementation of convolution?
I am not sure whether it is a bug of tf or an usage omission. So I posted the detailed version of the problem on StackOverflow.
