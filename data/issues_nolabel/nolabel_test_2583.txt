On the return values of bidirectional_rnn

Due to the overhead of tf.concat operations, it is recommended to use state_is_tuple flag in recurrent neural network layers.
However, I found that in bidirectional_rnn implementation, outputs (first return value) is returned as a concatenation of outputs_fw and outputs_bw.
Is there any reason that it should return the concatenated one?
I think it is trace of the days where concatenated states are used, and it would be nice to return forward and backward outputs separately.
It seems that it can be implemented simply without breaking backward compatibility, by adding a flag indicating what should be returned.
