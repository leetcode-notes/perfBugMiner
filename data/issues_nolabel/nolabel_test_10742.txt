The current makefile builds incomplete Tensorflow

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): not using bazel
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I have managed to cross compile using the Makefile approach but the API's are incomplete. I think it is because not all source files are included in the Makefile and the text files. Can someone provides a Makefile that is equivalent to bazel build //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so? I want to cross compile a library and use that on my custom platform.
