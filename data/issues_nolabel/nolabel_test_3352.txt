iOS Example with fine-tuned inception network memory error & quantization attempt

For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more easily we will be able to offer
help and advice.
Environment info
Operating System: iOS
Steps to reproduce


Follow the contrib/makefile/README to install the tensorflow iOS core lib


Create my own model using flower's example and shards (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception)


Create inference graph by removing shard preprocessing ops and replacing them with:
input_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1, FLAGS.image_size, FLAGS.image_size, 3),
name='input')
logits, _ = inception_model.inference(input_, FLAGS.num_classes + 1)
softmax = tf.nn.softmax(logits, name='softmax')
And loading a saved checkpoint, restoring it, then writing out a graph def.


Apply tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph on  graph def


Apply tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused on graph def


Copy graph def and labels file into camera example


Change objective-C image preprocessing to 299x299, with std & image_mean of 128.


What have you tried?

Running the 'simple' example on the grace hopper image. This works fine
Running the 'camera' example. This crashes after 3 seconds of the app being open with the output below:

It appears that this issue is similar to #2927 . I tried quantizing the graph (tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph with --mode=weights), but then ran into a 'quantize ops dont exist' type of error on iOS. It seems those ops need to be built by modifying tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_cc_files.txt and tensorflow/contrib/makefile/proto_text_pb_h_files.txt. I have attempting including into both every non-test file and header located in tensorflow/contrib/quantization/kernels, but am running into build-rule errors from the makefile. Unfortunately, I have little knowledge of adjusting makefiles for this type of application.
