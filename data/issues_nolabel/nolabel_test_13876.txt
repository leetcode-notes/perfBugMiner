Should we provide parameters for 'data_dir' or 'untar' to cifar10.load_data?

           def load_data(): 
        
    
  


This is maybe really a trivial issue for such a brilliant framework,
but it would be great more friendly to add this flexibility to load data from somewhere that I already have it and unpacked. Or it will fixed me to dig into the source to find where and in which format should this data be stored.
Hope that make sense.
Thanks a lot for you time.
