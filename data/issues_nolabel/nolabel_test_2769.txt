Bad example in docs for tf.multinomial

I think this comment in the docstring for tf.multinomial is wrong:
samples = tf.multinomial([[1, -1, -1]], 10) # samples is equivalent to tf.zeros([1, 10], dtype=tf.int64)

Logits of [1, -1, -1] do not assign zero probability to class 1 and 2.  Additionally, multinomial op has no kernel for logits of integer type, which is what's happening here. (Note usage of 1, not 1.0)
Since I can't figure out what purpose this example serves, my suggestion would be to remove it entirely.
I'm using tensorflow 845fb7a with Python 3.
