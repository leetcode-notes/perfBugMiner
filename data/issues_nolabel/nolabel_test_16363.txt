Warning: Table trying to initialize from file ... is already initialized

Python: 3.6.2
Tensorflow: 1.5.0rc1 pip
OS: Windows 10
No CUDA, just CPU
I get this when creating a lookup table with tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file.
As I have multiple graphs I create that table in each graph (from the same file) I need it in. This results in the warning from the title of this issue.

Are tables shared across graphs?
How to figure out if a table from a specific file is already existing/initialized?

This also occurs with tensorflow/nmt:
