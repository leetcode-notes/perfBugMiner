Print command not being called through gradient operation.

I have the following code.  When I call the image_graident function I expect it to print the image_reg variable.  It does not print anything when imageGraident() is called.
image_reg = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(input_image))
dream_obj = tf.nn.l2_loss(net.fc8) - image_reg
dream_obj = tf.Print(dream_obj, [image_reg])
delta_image = tf.gradients(dream_obj, input_image)[0]

delta_image = tf.Print(delta_image, [image_reg])

def imageGraident(img):
    orig_shape = img.shape
    img = np.reshape(img, (-1, 224, 224, 3))
    dimg = sess.run(delta_image, feed_dict = {input_image: img})
    return np.reshape(dimg, orig_shape)

However the following does work fine and it prints the value.
image_reg = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(input_image))
dream_obj = tf.nn.l2_loss(net.fc8) - image_reg

delta_image = tf.gradients(dream_obj, input_image)[0]
delta_image = tf.Print(delta_image, [image_reg])

def imageGraident(img):
    orig_shape = img.shape
    img = np.reshape(img, (-1, 224, 224, 3))
    dimg = sess.run(delta_image, feed_dict = {input_image: img})
    return np.reshape(dimg, orig_shape)

This seems like a bug to me but maybe I am missing something.
