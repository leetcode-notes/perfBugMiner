can not run mnistcnn.py, servers waiting for eachother

Hello everyone, I tried to run this script on three AWS machines. One parameter server and two workers.
However, the ps is always in "Initializing session..." and workers always waiting for the ps.
I believe the challenge is from here:
ps definitions:
flags.DEFINE_integer("worker_index", 0,
"Worker task index, should be >= 0. worker_index=0 is "
"the master worker task the performs the variable "
"initialization ")
flags.DEFINE_string("workers", "34.205.143.107:2222,54.83.142.82:2222",
"The worker url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-worker1:2222,1.2.3.4:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("parameter_servers", "http://54.86.223.142:2222",
"The ps url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-ps2:2222,1.2.3.5:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("worker_grpc_url", "grpc://54.86.223.142:2222",
"Worker GRPC URL (e.g., grpc://1.2.3.4:2222, or "
"grpc://tf-worker0:2222)")
worker definitions:
flags.DEFINE_integer("worker_index", 1,
"Worker task index, should be >= 0. worker_index=0 is "
"the master worker task the performs the variable "
"initialization ")
flags.DEFINE_string("workers", "34.205.143.107:2222,54.83.142.82:2222",
"The worker url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-worker1:2222,1.2.3.4:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("parameter_servers", "http://54.86.223.142:2222",
"The ps url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-ps2:2222,1.2.3.5:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("worker_grpc_url", "grpc://34.205.143.107:2222",
"Worker GRPC URL (e.g., grpc://1.2.3.4:2222, or "
"grpc://tf-worker0:2222)")
second worker
flags.DEFINE_integer("worker_index", 2,
"Worker task index, should be >= 0. worker_index=0 is "
"the master worker task the performs the variable "
"initialization ")
flags.DEFINE_string("workers", "34.205.143.107:2222,54.83.142.82:2222",
"The worker url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-worker1:2222,1.2.3.4:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("parameter_servers", "http://54.86.223.142:2222",
"The ps url list, separated by comma (e.g. tf-ps2:2222,1.2.3.5:2222)")
flags.DEFINE_string("worker_grpc_url", "grpc://83.142.82:2222",
"Worker GRPC URL (e.g., grpc://1.2.3.4:2222, or "
"grpc://tf-worker0:2222)")
