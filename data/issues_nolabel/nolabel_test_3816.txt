Bug in tf.image.random_contrast() ?

TensorFlow v. 0.10.0rc0 CPU on Linux.
In this file for the CIFAR-10 example:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py
Lines 178-179 are:
distorted_image = tf.image.random_contrast(distorted_image, lower=0.2, upper=1.8)

But this gives the following result. Is this the intended behaviour of this function? Perhaps this should be explained better in the doc-string?
There is a similar problem with tf.image.random_brightness() and adjust_brightness() and its use in cifar10_input.py
