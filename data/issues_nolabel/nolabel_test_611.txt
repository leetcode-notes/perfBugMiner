A time saving mode to extract the MNIST data

[tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist]
Since now it takes time to extract gz files even if they are already download on a local machine, why don't we consider an additional mode which saves extract data as binary data?
I submitted the update code of input_data.py and the update first line in run_training(), which is
data_sets = input_data.read_data_sets(FLAGS.train_dir, FLAGS.fake_data, fastload = True)
Any opinion?
