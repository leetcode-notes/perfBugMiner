Clarify Migration From session_bundle.exporter to saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder

In looking at the docs for Serving a TensorFlow Model, and comparing to wayback machine, it seems the serving guide went from using session_bundle.exporter to saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder with no documentation as to this change or the migration path.
Both tools wrap Savers. What is the difference between these? I believe session_bundle is deprecated and SavedModelBuilder is supposed to be a replacement however I have not seen this point made explicitly in the docs. All I could find is a comment in the loader:
Load legacy TF Exporter/SessionBundle checkpoint.
