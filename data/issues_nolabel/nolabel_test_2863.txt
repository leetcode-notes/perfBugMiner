fix dim mismatch bug in resnet example.

There was a bug which confused residual blocks with residual groups,
which is just  a list of blocks. The output of each block should be of
the same dimension as the input so that a residual connection can be
made. Upscaling only occurs between groups.
Changed some of the variable names to clarify the distinction between
groups, blocks and layers.
