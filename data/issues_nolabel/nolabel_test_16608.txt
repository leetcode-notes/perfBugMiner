Can't find Stochastic Tensors class

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Ubuntu 16.04:
source:
TensorFlow version 1.5:
3.6:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
Apparently, stochastic_tensor is not present in tf.contrib.bayesflow which doesn't reflect here in the api_guides. I have not mentioned my complete system information as I think it might not be needed, please let me know if it is required to further investigate the issue. Any help/suggestions would be highly appreciated.
