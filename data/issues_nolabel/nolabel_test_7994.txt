Loading and re-training the model

Hi, I am confused, if it is possible to load the last checkpoint for the model and now use another data to train the same model, so widen it's knowledge ?
Usecase: chatbot
data1: cornell-movie data
data2: stack exchange dataset
Firstlt, I had trained a seq2seq model on the cornell data, with some hyperparameters and other important variables, now i want my same model to train on other datasets also. Is this possible ?
