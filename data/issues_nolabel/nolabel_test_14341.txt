Add checkpoint file prefix check

V2 format refers checkpoint files by their file name prefix whereas V1 format refers checkpoint by actual file. I added a check to verify the V2 checkpoint reference is not a file. Also, the return value for saver.save() has changed for V2 so I corrected the doc string.
