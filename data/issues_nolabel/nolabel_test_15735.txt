Segmentation fault when using cuDNN LSTMs + orthogonal initializer

On TF 1.4.0 with CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 7, I get a segmentation fault if I use an orthogonal initializer for the kernel_initializer argument of cudnn_rnn.CudnnLSTM (the layers version not the op). I'm aware of #14306 but since I'm running into this problem with the cuDNN LSTMs and not the native TF ones I suspect the underlying cause is different.
