document how to use selective_registration and the use of __ANDROID_FULL_TYPE__

Every developer wants to use his own model.
Most app built for Mobile will crash at runtime, because those model won't just use the sparse subset of ops shipped with the aar available from jcenter
Which means, that mobile developers need a way to easily and painlessly cross compile tenserflow with the right ops for their custom models.
The print_header_for_selecrtive_registration.py  script is a good step in the right direction for this but it is not documented.
The documentation is completely lacking. Please document how to cross-compile tenserflow for mobile with the right types, and the right ops. With want command ? what files should we modify, where ?
I spent days looking at the tensorflow code/build files trying things and I still could not build a binary that would make that annoying "Op wasn't registered issue" away
Fix this !Â This is not an individual problem, look at the amount of questions and issues about "tenserflow and Op wasn't registered" on the internet.
btw, the tensorflow aar from jcenter is completely useless as it can only be used to build the demo app.
It would be better to put the demo apk on Google play, it would not mislead developers into thinking they can easily build apps with it
