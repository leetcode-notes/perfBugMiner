tf.Print is not an identity op w/ tuples or lists of Tensors; clarify in docs or add warning msg?

Documentation issue with bidirectional_dynamic_rnn:
For "outputs":
"...It returns a tuple instead of a single concatenated Tensor, unlike in the bidirectional_rnn. If the concatenated one is preferred, the forward and backward outputs can be concatenated as tf.concat(2, outputs)."
This doesn't appear to work.  As a fix:
output, _ = tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn(...)
output=tf.concat(2, tf.unpack(output))
...this appears to be necessary because tf.concat does not view the returned tuple as equivalent to a list of Tensors, but rather appears to treat the tuple (effectively) as a Tensor.
Possible bug in tf.concat:
Unclear whether tf.concat(2, output) actually should, in fact, return as the initial documentation for bidirectional_dynamic_rnn suggested.
