ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

I got this error messsage when trying to train the images. FYI my images is more than 20.
My command
sudo python retrain.py --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks --how_many_training_steps=500 --model_dir=tf_files/inception --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt --image_dir /Users/ZERO/Documents/Github/tensorflow-python/tf_files/images/..

Error message
