DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (numpy) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

Steps to reproduce
1: Read  the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html:
"Launching TensorBoard
To run TensorBoard, use the command
tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory"
2: Do what it says
% tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory
tensorboard: Command not found.

What have you tried?
1: Try rehash
% rehash
% tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory
tensorboard: Command not found.

2:
% locate tensorboard
%

3:
% which tensorboard
tensorboard: Command not found.

Check Google, find StackExchange post "How to install tensorboard"
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33634008/how-to-install-tensorboard
Comments suggest that if one installs via pip (as I did), then tensorboard is available on the command-line, but it is not.
Alternate invocation of tensorboard via python is not the same as in the Tutorial but does work....
% python /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py --logdir=/tmp/mnist_logs
Starting TensorBoard 16 on port 6006
(You can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:6006)...

and everything works.
...Conclusion is that either online Tutorial documentation is incorrect and needs revision, or pip installation does not perform as advertised, or...user error.
Workarounds:



% alias tensorboard 'python /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py'
% tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/mnist_logs




`echo '#! /usr/bin/env python' > tmp.txt ; cat tmp.txt /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py > tensorboard ; chmod u+x tensorboard ; rm -f tmp.txt; sudo mv tensorboard /opt/local/bin/
