[cmake] Build error in dependency re2

Somehow the re2 dependency does not get build correctly.
I think its because of re2_INCLUDE_DIR in re.cmake holding two directories. Then COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory ${re2_INCLUDE_DIR} fails since cmake -E make_directory only takes one arg. I'm just comiping and might add a PR if it works.
