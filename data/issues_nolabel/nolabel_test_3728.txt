contrib.learn.DNNRegressor not compatible for e.g. GridSearchCV

Imho the new architecture of contrib.learn.DNNRegressor (compared to the old contrib.learn.TensorflowDNNRegressor) makes it impossible to properly use things like GridSearchCV from sklearn. To use GridSearchCV I have to pass all parameters to be tuned to the constructor. In the new architecture of DNNRegressor some parameters are passed to the fit-method which is quite untypical for sklearns architecture usually expecting only X and y as parameters of the fit-method. For example I can no longer tune steps and batch_size (now part of the fit-method) with GridSearchCV. I can only pass them as fixed fit_params. Or am I getting something wrong?
