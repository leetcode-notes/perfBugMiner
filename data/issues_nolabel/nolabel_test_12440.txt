How to Retrain Inception v3 without a reshape layer?

Hi all,
I was trying the pretrained Inception v3 model available in tensorflow.When i was looking into the tensorgraph of the retrained model i found that while retrianing it uses a reshape layer followed by a full connected layer.
Is there any method to retrain the model without using the reshape layer?
Please suggest me any possible solution if possible.
Thank and Regards
