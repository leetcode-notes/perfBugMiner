python3 convolutional.py

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Install cudnn v5.1
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
The code sample failed, complaining about cudnn and tensorflow version mismatch. I lost the original output. It said something like the tensorflow is build with cudnn 51000x, but the loaded cudnn lib is 50000.
Then, I installed cudnn v5.1, and the message is gone, and the sample code runs.
I followed the installation instruction on https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation. I think either the instruction needs update to tell people to install cudnn v5.1; or something mistakenly build tensorflow with cudnn v5.1 and released it.
