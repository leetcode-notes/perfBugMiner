tf.constant and tf.ones behave differently with unknown shape dimension

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary

The problem
The following code works
import tensorflow as tf
batch_size = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[])
ones = tf.ones((batch_size,))

while the following does not work
import tensorflow as tf
batch_size = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[])
ones = tf.constant(1, shape=(batch_size,))

>>> ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.

To my mind, these should be equivalent ways of creating a tensor of ones with dynamic size. This is particularly annoying if one wants to create a constant tensor with a value different from 0 or 1.
