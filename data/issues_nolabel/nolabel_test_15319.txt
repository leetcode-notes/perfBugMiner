Cannot import tensorflow after installing tensorflow-gpu - Windows

I am running windows 10 64bit.
Tensorflow-gpu version - 1.4.0
CUDA version - 8.0
cuDNN - v6.0
I installed it using the cmd command: pip install tensorflow-gpu and do not have any other version of tensorflow installed. now when I try to execute
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
print(device_lib.list_local_devices())

I get the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
I am hoping getting this working will solve my bigger issue of tensorflow not recognizing my gpu for gpu processing.
