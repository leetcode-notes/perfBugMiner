Error installing from source

In the procedure of installing from source,
when I try to do "bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg"
then an error occurs and the message is like this:
"error: can't copy 'tensorflow/models/embedding/gen_word2vec.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file"
In the directory of 'tensorflow/models/embedding/', there does not exist named "gen_word2vec.py", only "word2vec.py" is in there.
(Changing the file name "word2vec.py" as "gen_word2vec.py", but it does not make it.)
OS : OS X El Capitan(10.11.6)
TensorFlow : r0.11(Same problem occurs r0.10)
In #4234, recommended method is installing the TF's branch r0.10, but it does not work for me.
How can I solve it?
