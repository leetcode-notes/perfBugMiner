Error when feeding model

Hi!
I have downloaded and tried the RNN tutorial, it works great and I want to mod it to use it for another project.
I have managed to write my own "reader" which uses my desired data and training the model seems to work, somewhat, I think. I feed my model the following dict:
feed_dict = {m.input_data: x, m.targets: y, m.initial_state: state}
cost, state, _ = session.run([m.cost, m.final_state, eval_op], feed_dict=feed_dict)

where x and y are the outputs from the reader.iterator method (the one I wrote, but nearly identical to the ptb_iterator used in the tutorial).
I have also created a "runner" module which only imports a already trained model and runs it. But I am unable to run this code. I import a saved checkpoint into my session using the saver.restore method and that seems to work. But for the "runner" code I changed the feed_dict to be:
feed_dict = {m.input_data: input_id_list, m.initial_state: state}
since I do not have an output this time, this is what I want the network to come up with.
I also have this in the session.run:
session.run([m.cost, m.targets, eval_op], feed_dict=feed_dict)
So this time (in contrast to the "trainer" code) I want to have the output of m.targets.
But when I try to run the "runner" code, I get this output:
log.txt
I have checked so the shape of input_id_list is (1, 4). That is also what is printed on the first line in the log file. And from the error message I can see that the Tensorflow placeholder is of shape (1,4) as well. All this makes sense since my config is set to batch_size=1 and num_steps=4.
It also mentions that the input is of wrong type, not a int32, but it is the same input as when I run the "trainer" version of the code, so why would it work then but not now?
Thank you for all help and feedback! Let me know if I should submit more code/logs/etc!
