add _div_metric, sensitivity, specificity

This PR propose the following changes:
1. Add two new metrics: tf.metrics.sensitivity and tf.metrics.specificity.
tf.metrics.sensitivity is identical to tf.metrics.recall. These two metrics accept labels and predictions as parameters, cast predictions to boolean, and then do the computation according to formula:
sensitivity = true_positive / (true_positive + false_negative)
specificity = true_negative / (true_negative + false_positive)
2. Add a helper function _div_metric
This helper function can be used to compute all metrics that is defined as the quotient of two metrics. This helper function simplifies the computation of a couple of metrics.
Further comments:

Would it be beneficial if we rename _div_metric to div_metric and make it public?
I don't see any unit test for tf.metrics, do I miss something?
