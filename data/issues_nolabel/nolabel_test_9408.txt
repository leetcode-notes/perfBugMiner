Allocation tracking of pre-tracked buffer returned in a tuple should increment the buffer by 2

A buffer not pre-tracked has its ref-count set to 2 when it is part of a tuple. A buffer
pre-tracked has its value increased by 1, whether it is part of a tuple or not.  This is
an error.
This fix increments a pre-tracked buffer by the amount of the 'initial_ref_count', which
is really the number of references that a buffer acquires as part of being returned (1 for
a single buffer, but 2 when it is part of a tuple).
