freeze_graph not working as expected

I am currently attempting to export a protobuf file to Android. To do that, I generated a .pbtxt file using http://pastebin.com/HcWA0xMQ to run freeze_graph on. I saved the protobuf file as text because when I try to save it as binary and run it with freeze_graph, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/leslie/tensorflow-master/bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.runfiles/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.py", line 135, in <module>

    return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x96 in position 331: invalid start byte

After generating the frozen graph with the .pbtxt file, I tried to run it on Android but for some reason am getting the same output every time regardless of the input. I also noticed, that the frozen graph is actually smaller than the checkpoint file even though it's supposed to be bigger according to the pre-release documentation I got (deploying.txt).
