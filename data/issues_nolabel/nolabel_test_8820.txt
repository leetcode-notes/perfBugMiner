Feature Request: Accelerate TensorFlow core on FPGA - How?

Consider the two following hardware scenarios:

Linux running on x86 w/ FPGA fabric connected via PCIe
Linux running on Arm A53 with AXI i/f to FPGA fabric (Think Xilinx Zynq)

How could the tensorflow core be accelerated for these scenarios?
FPGA vendors do offer OpenCL binaries for running OpenCL APIs to parallelize computations.
Forgive me, I am a bit ignorant, still learning in this area, but I am intrigued by the future possibility of this, and would love to help in anyway I can.
