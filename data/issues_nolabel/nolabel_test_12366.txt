Documentation for windows install is wrong/misleading

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows states
Requirements to run TensorFlow with GPU support
cuDNN v5.
This is now incorrect.
TensorFlow 1.3 or later requires cuDNN 6. ('cudnn64_6.dll')
I also suggest you add a comment and link to this gist

He just saved me hours.
