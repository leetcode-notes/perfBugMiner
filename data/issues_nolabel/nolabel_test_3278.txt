Implement 3D data for LSTM RNN -- request

I'm new to this, and I'm not sure where is the appropriate place to make a dev requests. If I am in the wrong place, can someone please redirect me?
I am not an experienced Tensorflow dev or I would try to build this myself, but I think it is a really interesting idea and I would love for another dev to build it.
The idea is for an LSTM RNN to accept 3D data -- such as video frames. I'm interested in papers such as this, where LSTM RNN's are used for object tracking. Also this paper.
Is there a way to do this already in Tensorflow?
I know I can flatten data, but that kind of defeats the point. I want a 3D network. In other words, please look at the attached picture for what I am envisioning.

Each frame is a full layer (in a horizontal direction). The second layer has inputs from both the second frame and the outputs from the first frame.
