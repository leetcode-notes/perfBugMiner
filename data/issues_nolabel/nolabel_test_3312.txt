drawing random numbers in a loop

Hey tf-community,
Please consider the following example:
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.random_normal(shape=(1,), mean=0.0, stddev=1.0)
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run([x for _ in xrange(4)])
This results in a list of four identical numbers. What I would expect, however, is a list of 4 independently drawn numbers. Is this behaviour by design? And if so, is there a way to specify that I would like to have four different numbers?
Drawing a vector of numbers is not applicable to my situation...
Thx,
Mat
