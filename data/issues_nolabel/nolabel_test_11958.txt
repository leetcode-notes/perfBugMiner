[Bug?]Session Hang during training with 'mnist_replica.py' and learning rate as a placeholder

System information
OS: Mac OS
TF: 1.2.0, pip install
Python: 2.7.9
also tested on RHEL with TF 1.1 and Python 2.7.13, the problem still exists. I don't think it is system specific.
Describe the problem
I am training the 'mnist-replica.py' provided on github. link is here
and set up two workers and one parameter server on my laptop.
I made only one modification to the code:
use learning_rate as a placeholder rather than a fixed value and feed 0.01 to it each step.
When I train it asynchronously, it is ok to go, but the session hangs in .run() after one or two steps when I train it in synchronous.
Can anyone figure out the reason of this?
Source code / logs
the source code is
here. just provide it for ease. It is almost the same as the original one.
