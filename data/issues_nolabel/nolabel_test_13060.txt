Pyinstaller with Tensorflow takes incorrect path for _checkpoint_ops.so file

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04, Pyinstaller
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0 cuDNN 6.0
GPU model and memory: 3x nVidia GEForce 1080

Describe the problem
As Tensorflow's load_op_library finds paths according to the OS it is being run on, I believe this is a problem with Tensorflow in Pyinstaller environment.
I am trying to make an executable of my Python code which uses Tensorflow . The executable gets generated correctly but when I try to run it, I get the following error:

If we look carefully, Pyinstaller is expecting the file _checkpoint_ops.so in directory tensorflow/contrib/util/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/ but there's no directory like this. _checkpoint_ops.so is located at tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/. How can this be fixed?
