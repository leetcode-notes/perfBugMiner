How to change the model, without any change into android APK file

Hello,
I want to make an android app in this way, like we can change model file anytime in future, and it will not require any change into application code, means no need to generate new APK file of application, on any change into model.
In short I want to know, is there anyway to place model file other then assets folder. So that I can refer updated model file anytime from app.
Thanks,
Sumeet Guha.
