Feature request: add tensor.<xyz> methods that redirect to tf.<xyz>(tensor,...)

Any TensorFlow API function func that takes tensor as a first argument could be implemented as tensor.func(...). This is implemented in PyTorch/numpy and can make formulas more concise. Transpose is a frequent special case that deserves a shortcut like T.

Compare:
Numpy:
b = a @ a.T
b.trace()

PyTorch:
b =  a @ a.t()
b.trace()

TensorFlow:
b = a @ tf.transpose(a)
tf.trace(b)
