Describe the problem
Indeed, I have some local modification.  I'm trying to fix some failed cc_tests on Windows, and turn on them in bazel_test_lib.sh
The problem is: As the number of tests is growing,  we can't pass all their names through command line. We need a new way to filter the tests.
What about:
Remove the settings in tensorflow/tools/ci_build/windows/cpu/bazel/run_cc_test_windows.bat,  replace them with bazel tags like "no_windows", "gpu_only", ... ?
