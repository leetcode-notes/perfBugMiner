tf.contrib.data.Iterator.make_initializer operation lacks name

I'm using tf.contrib.data for my input pipeline. Since it feeds the model without placeholders, I need to be able to reload both the model and input pipeline in order to resume training later. However, the make_initializer method of tf.contrib.data.Iterator does not have a name argument like most (all?) other Tensorflow operations, making it impossible (or at best, error-prone) to find these ops in the reloaded graph. Unless I'm mistaken, this seems like a standard use-case and the missing name argument is inconsistent with the rest of Tensorflow.
