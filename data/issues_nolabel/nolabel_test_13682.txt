can any one reproduce this problew with tf.gather?

x = tf.constant([[0.22, 0.3,0.1,0.11],[0.4,0.5, 0.6,0.99],[0.8, 0.9,0.43,0.21]])
indices = tf.constant([[1,2],[0,1],[2,3]])
b=tf.gather_nd(x, indicesï¼‰
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
cc=sess.run([b], feed_dict={})
print cc
with tensorflow 1.0.1 it gets [array([ 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32)]
is it a bug in 1.0.1, but with higher version,it gets right
