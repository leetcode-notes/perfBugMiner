Memory corrupt when running in distributed mode with CUDA 8.0 and Tesla M40

We have implemented tested the distributed TensorFlow applications. It works in CPU environment and the GPU environment with CUDA 7.5 and Tesla K40. But it fails with CUDA 8.0 and Tesla M40.


Not sure if it's related to CUDA 8.0. The test code is here and 100% re-produce if I run it with CUDA 8.0 and Tesla M40.
