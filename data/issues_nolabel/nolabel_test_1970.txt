Scikit Flow Readme file

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/README.md
Seems to me that README file extension should be rst. But instead it is a markdown and now all links are broken etc.
If this is true then first row should be changed to |License| |Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tensorflow/skflow| and everything is alright.
