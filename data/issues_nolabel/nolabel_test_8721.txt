Issue while executing https://github.com/suriyadeepan/easy_seq2seq

I tried running execute.py from https://github.com/suriyadeepan/easy_seq2seq however, I'm facing trouble with this.
Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but a suggestion or a solution would be great help.
This is the dump from my Windows CMD prompt:
C:\Users\myPC\Downloads\easy_seq2seq-master\easy_seq2seq-master>python execu te.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
