Launch the project from Xcode, console outputs following errors:

Running model failed:Invalid argument: Session was not created with a graph before Run()!

What have you tried?

ran the following script referenced in #2883:

bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:strip_unused && \ bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused \ --input_graph=your_retrained_graph.pb \ --output_graph=stripped_graph.pb \ --input_node_names=Mul \ --output_node_names=final_result \ --input_binary=true
However, I receive the following error:
/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused.runfiles/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/python/framework/graph_util.py", line 156, in extract_sub_graph assert d in name_to_node_map, "%s is not in graph" % d AssertionError: final_result is not in graph
