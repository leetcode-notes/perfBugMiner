Question about the API document of convolution

In issue 196, the problem of definition of different padding is mentioned.
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn.html#convolution
I think the document of convolution is still quite confusing right now.
What does the different dimension of strides = [1, 1, 1, 1] mean?
Why the definition of "VALID" and "SAME" padding is quite different from the Stanford cs131n tutorial.
I think most of the people learn CNN according to the tutorials online. Is it possible to modify the document according to the tutorial?  Thank you very much.
