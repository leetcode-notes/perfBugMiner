Add the shared libraries in the quickstart

When following the quickstart steps of the golang README.md, below issue is found:
$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu-16 4.4.0-57-generic #78-Ubuntu SMP Fri Dec 9 23:50:32 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ go test github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go
/tmp/go-build828413616/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/_test/go.test: error while loading shared libraries: libtensorflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
FAIL	github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go	0.001s
It's due to the env variable, after adding the LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it became ok.
$ go test github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go
ok  	github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go	0.246s
so I updated the README.md file.
