Fix typo & Clarify comment

Fix typo in comment : Profiler -> Profile
uint64 can be misunderstood as np.uint64. So I propose to change it to int

This edit is to avoid misusage of tf.Profile by a developer using it for the first time. See the scenario below:

He or she follow this instruction from comment
He or she may want to pass evaluated global_step (which type is np.int32) to profiler.add_step

global_step = tf.Variable(0, name="global_step", trainable=False)
step = session.run(global_step, ...)
profiler.add_step(step, run_meta)


profiler.add_step raise TypeError: in method 'AddStep', argument 1 of type 'int64'
So he or she may mistakenly try again to convert np.uint32 step to np.uint64 step. Because comment said use uint64 type for step

profiler.add_step(step.astype(np.uint64), run_meta)

BUT! TypeError: in method 'AddStep', argument 1 of type 'int64' raise again!
... correct answer is to try to convert step as int(step).
