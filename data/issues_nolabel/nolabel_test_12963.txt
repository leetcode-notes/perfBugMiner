Cover the numpy-ndarray bug on s390x

NumPy's low-level method for instantiating an array (ndarray constructor) is behaving differently for s390x architecture. Providing the data type of the array's elements explicitly is solving the issue. Please refer to issue#11431 for the detailed discussion. Though this a bug with NumPy implementation, adding data type for array elements should be safe.
