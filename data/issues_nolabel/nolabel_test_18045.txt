Feature Request: Raise Error when using queue without starting it

When using functions like tf.train.batch() or tf.train.shuffle_batch() and probably more,  one needs to start the queue with tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess). If used without it, above functions are still executable but hang indefinitely. I suggest raising an error if the queue hasn't been started before, as this has costed me a lot of time to figure out.
Alternatively point more directly to this usage in the documentation of the functions and the guide.
This might help a lot of people!
