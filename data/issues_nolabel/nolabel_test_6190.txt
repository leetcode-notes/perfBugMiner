Hanging when Matching Filenames in 0.12

I have a network which uses tf.train.shuffle_batch with a tf.train.string_input_produces. The network worked in 0.11, but hangs in 0.12.
Disclaimer: I don't have access to 0.11 anymore and I changed some other stuff, but I'm fairly sure that the important bit is still the same.
Hanging means: I don't get further than the "Creating TensorFlow device" message.
The reason I'm thinking it's due to the queue is because after enabling the log_device_placement flag, the last output I'm seeing is
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/simple_placer.cc:827] 
    matching_filenames/MatchingFiles/pattern

Also, using a barebowns graph like
a = tf.constant(4)
b = tf.constant(2)
s = tf.Session()
s.run(a + b)

works, so I don't think it is due to my TensorFlow installation.
The hang is reproducible for me. I don't know how to enable further logging but would be glad to do so.

The code to create the queue is as follows, basically it's the same as in the tutorial
filenames = tf.train.match_filenames_once(filenames_glob)
filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(
    filenames, num_epochs=num_epochs, shuffle=shuffle)
image = _read_pngs(filename_queue)

min_after_dequeue = 100
capacity = min_after_dequeue + 1 * batch_size

return tf.train.shuffle_batch(
    [image],
    batch_size=batch_size, capacity=capacity,
    min_after_dequeue=min_after_dequeue,
    seed=666, name=name)
