inter_op_parallelism_threads on Window for GPU models

I need to limit CPU usage of tensorflow on Windows by setting inter_op_parallelism_threads = 1 , ( intra_op_parallelism_threads = 1  also for CPU)
When I run a model on CPU, inter_op_parallelism_threads = 1  works perfectly, and only one logical core is used.
But when I run a model on GPU,  inter_op_parallelism_threads =1 doesn't work,  tensorflow still uses all the available logical cores.
