List of 2Ds -> 3D Tensor, seq2seq_loss

Use full tensor and reshape instead of evaluating at every timestep, computationally more efficient and faster. Further, handles None in sequence length and raw_rnn style RNN classes does not work with a list of Tensors.
Implemented handling of list as input, so it does not break backwards compatibility.
