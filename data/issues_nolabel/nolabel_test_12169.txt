Request for Tile operation for integer types

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-5-g435cdfc', '1.2.1')
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 5
GPU model and memory: TitanX 12G
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
I need some matrix indices computation using tf.tile function. But now it is only available for float types.
So I have to cast int into float and after computation back into int. It would be great to have "tile" function working with tensors with dtype of integer types.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    tt = tf.tile(tf.range(4), [3])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(tt))

InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device for operation 'Tile': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
