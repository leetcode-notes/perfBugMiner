Tensorflow 1.5.0 import error under CUDA 8.0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
pip install tensorflow-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.5.0
Python version:
3.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory:
GTX1080ti
Exact command to reproduce:
pip install tensorflow-gpu
python
import tensorflow as tf

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Tensorflow 1.4 works fine with the same setup as described above. However, after upgrade tensorflow to 1.5 using pip install tensorflow-gpu, it fails to import tensorflow package in python.
