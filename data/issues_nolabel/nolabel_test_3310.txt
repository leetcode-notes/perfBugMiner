warning when running commands with bazel

Hello, I'm installing tensorflow following instructions of
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html
especially in "Installing from sources"
I almost encountered the below warnings when running commands with bazel
Among the warnings, I'd like to resolve the warning which says 'in includes attribute of cc_library rule //_' resolves to '_' not in 'third_party'. This will be an error in the future.'
btw, what does the above warnings mean and why was the warnings occurred?
As I saw other person's console outputs through googling, many people also went through the warnings. However, many of them seem to ignore them.
I'm a little concerned because of the final sentence saying 'This will be an error in the future'
I'd appreciate any reply, thank you very much
