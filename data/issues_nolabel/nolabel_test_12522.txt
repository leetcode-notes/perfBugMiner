Stacking CNN with LSTM

I am trying to stack CNN before LSTM, however, I am experience a little problem.
My LSTM + CTC works fine. However, I want to pass extracted feature from CNN to LSTM instead of whole image.
The code is here: https://gist.github.com/kjanjua26/b756b6aae2277423c1f94b435a82f808
I error I am facing is:
File "trainer2.py", line 182, in <module> train() File "trainer2.py", line 75, in train logits, inputs, targets, seq_len,W, b = model.get_train_model() File "/home2/kamranjanjua/tf_cnnlstm/tlstm9Aug/model.py", line 97, in get_train_model outputs, _ = tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn(forwardH1,backwardH1,x,seq_len,dtype=tf.float32) File "/home/kamranjanjua/anaconda2/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py", line 652, in bidirectional_dynamic_rnn time_major=time_major, scope=fw_scope) File "/home/kamranjanjua/anaconda2/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py", line 845, in dynamic_rnn dtype=dtype) File "/home/kamranjanjua/anaconda2/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py", line 919, in _dynamic_rnn_loop "Input size (depth of inputs) must be accessible via shape inference," ValueError: Input size (depth of inputs) must be accessible via shape inference, but saw value None.
Any help in this matter would be appreciated. I am kind of stuck here.
