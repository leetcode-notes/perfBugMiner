fix bugs in `stack_bidirectional_rnn`

The condition of the original codes is not related to the constraint.
  if initial_states_bw is not None and (not isinstance(cells_bw, list) or
                                        len(cells_bw) != len(cells_bw)):
     raise ValueError(
         "initial_states_bw must be a list of state tensors (one per layer).")

I think initial_states_bw is written as cells_bw by mistake.
