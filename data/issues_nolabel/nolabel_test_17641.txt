Feature request: tf.as_dtype(float) should work just as tf.as_dtype('float')

In NumPy, np.dtype(float) works just the same as np.dtype("float").
In TensorFlow tf.as_dtype("float") works but tf.as_dtype(float) crashes with TypeError: Cannot convert value <class 'float'> to a TensorFlow DType..
Is there a particular reason for this behaviour or was it just overlooked?
(same error for other builtins such as int and complex)
