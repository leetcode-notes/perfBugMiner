Steps to reproduce

example from https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/recurrent/index.html github in: tensorflow/tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb/
wget http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/simple-examples.tgz and extract it
python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=simple-examples/data/ after you get

What have you tried?

Running it - i'm new to TF, however the cost is nan and doesn't make sense that iters is nan as well. Tried both TF 0.9 and 0.8 , same output
