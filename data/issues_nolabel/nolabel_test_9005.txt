fix windows gpu build by disabling nccl which currently will not compile/work on windows

Windows gpu builds got broken because nccl was include in cmake (08a3e36).
nccl currently does not compile/work on windows (unfortunate). To make nccl compile/work is more work so I disable the nccl op from windows for now to make the gpu build happy. There is a PR (NVIDIA/nccl#31) for nccl that makes it mostly work on windows ... watching that and if merged we can try to make this work.
