Documentation on fault tolerance in distributed tensorflow

Hi,
I know the white paper describes how Tensorflow handles failures in distributed execution, but the docs for open source tensorflow (specifically: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/distributed/index.md) don't really explain what to expect if a machine goes down in a cluster. It would be nice to know:

What the expected behavior is if a machine fails.
If it's possible to add a new machine to the cluster if one fails.

Thanks!
