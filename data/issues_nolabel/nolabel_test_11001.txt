Moved tpu_config.RunConfig check to beginning

This is necessary because wrapped_model_fn calls _create_infeed_enqueue_ops_and_dequeue_fn which requires a TPU Config. Though the actual call is delayed to a later time, it would be better to raise this error earlier.  Also this check is only necessary inside use_tpu block.
