Increase docstring consistency

This PR considers the following six main items:

Adjusting indents of markdown code blocks
Adding language identifiers on markdown code blocks
Replacing Return with Returns (The frequencies over all python codes: 2 vs. 3369)
Replacing Arguments with Args
(Args is a consistent word over all python codes except tensorflow/contrib/keras and tensorflow/python/layers)
In tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py, removing ``` for consistency on the file
In tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py and math_ops.py, revising python code blocks to make them more concrete

I think it is better to replace ==> with # because ==> is not a python keyword.
For each operation, two styles (with and without tf.) are mixed. I think it is better to make them as tf.operation not operation.
For more concrete examples, I think it is better to write down real tensors not pseudo. (e.g.,# 'x' is [1, 4] is replaced by x = tf.constant([1, 4]).)
