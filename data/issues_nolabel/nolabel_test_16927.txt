image_retraining/retrain.py warning: Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is deprecated. It will cease to work in GraphDef version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization()

If I download https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py and run it I get the following warning:
2018-02-10 20:48:38.928435: W C:\tf_jenkins\workspace\rel-win\M\windows\PY\36\tensorflow\core\framework\op_def_util.cc:343] Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is deprecated. It will cease to work in GraphDef version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().
Here is a screenshot if that helps:

After looking at some old TensorFlow issues, for example these:
#2164
#4128
It seems that this concern has existed for quite a while and that it seems likely related to using the Inception model from 2015:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py#L893
Can anybody update this to resolve this warning please?
