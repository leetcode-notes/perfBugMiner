Unable to compile TF, CUBLAS_GEMM_ALGO? not declared in scope

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)?: no
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)?: source
TensorFlow version: 1.1.0rc1 (master as of April 5, 2017)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8/5.1
GPU Model and Memory: Titan X (PASCAL) 12GB
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx --copt=-mfma --copt=-mfpmath=both --config=cuda -k //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Here's the compile config:
$ ./configure 
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /path/to/anaconda2/bin/python]: 
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: 
Do you wish to use jemalloc as the malloc implementation? [Y/n] n
jemalloc disabled
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N] 
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [y/N] 
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with the XLA just-in-time compiler (experimental)? [y/N] 
No XLA support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Found possible Python library paths:
/path/to/python/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/path/to/python/site-packages]
/path/to/python/site-packages
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL support? [y/N] 
No OpenCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N] y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N] 
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler
Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /opt/gcc/4.9.2/bin/gcc]: 
Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]: 
Please specify the location where CUDA  toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: /opt/cuda-8.0
Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to use system default]: 
Please specify the location where cuDNN  library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /opt/cuda-8.0]: /opt/cudnn-8.0
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size.
[Default is: "3.5,5.2"]: 3.5,5.2,6.1
Warning: ignoring LD_PRELOAD in environment.

INFO: Starting clean (this may take a while). Consider using --async if the clean takes more than several minutes.
Configuration finished


Describe the problem clearly
CentOS 6.6, compiling using instructions from #110 (comment) gives an error as mentioned later.
I have been able to compile TF upto 1.0.1 successfully on the same machine.
Also, same issue was mentioned in #8790 (comment), but I'm not sure if the OP opened an issue
