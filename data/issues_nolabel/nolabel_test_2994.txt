cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py - unintended loss reporting

cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py
At this line, every loss for each tower in the multi GPU is calculated
However, these losses are not averaged, and it seems like the loss from the last GPU is used to return loss.
Is this on purpose (if yes, why?) or is it a bug in the code?
