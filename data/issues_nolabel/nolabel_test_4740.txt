fully_connected_preloaded_var.py unexpectedly slow

From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39840323/benchmark-of-howto-reading-data -- examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py runs roughly 10x faster per step (feed_dict) than examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_preloaded_var.py (TF variable with slice_input_producer). Looking at Timeline (attached), it seems the training is bottlenecked on QueueDequeueMany which takes 13ms
which is about 100x slower than corresponding segment on feed_dict example timeline. Also, the timing taken by QueueDequeueMany scales linearly with batch-size. IE, increasing batch-size to 200 makes it take 22ms.
