Regex tag and zoom in for histogram summary does not work properly

Since ResNet could create hundreds of layers and the initial activation value of layers are also very large, I found I need to zoom in multiple times, and also have hundreds of histogram summary in one tag group. So it would be critical to be able to zoom, and also break summary down according to regex.
However, I found though for scalar summary, it works pretty well, for histogram summary, I can only zoom in once in 0.9.0, and not even once in 0.10.0. Also the regex group function seems to not work at all (see the photo below, it seems all summary comes in whatever the regex is --- I write a "###" in this case).
At first I though it is just there are too many graphs, so my computer stuck. But after I tried some small network, the phenomenon held. Could it be fixed? Thanks a lot.
