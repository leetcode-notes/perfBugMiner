Eager: Using graphs in the same Python process

Once eager execution is enabled via tfe.enable_eager_execution(), it cannot be disabled in the same process. This means that eager and graph execution cannot be mixed in the same Python session.
This issue has been filed to track development of features to make the transition between eager and graph execution smoother -- allowing users to pick and choose portions of the computation that will be “compiled” into graphs for optimized execution, and portions that will execute eagerly.
