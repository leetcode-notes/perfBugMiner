Remove explicit dependency on Python 2.7 from crosstool wrapper

Many superclusters need to compile TensorFlow from source due to an outdated glibc version (see #110). In @rdipietro's excellent workaround post (#110 (comment)) he mentions issues with the referenced Python version in this file. I have issues as well, but of a different nature. In my case the build script is unable to find libpython2.7.so.1.0, since only Python 3 is present on my machine. The issue originates from crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc where the only Python 2.7 exclusive feature is the print statement. By importing print_function from __future__ the explicit dependency can be dropped and both versions of Python are supported.
