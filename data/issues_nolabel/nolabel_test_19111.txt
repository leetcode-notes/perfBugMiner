[tfgan] Simplify estimator gan_model_fn

This removes _make_train_gan_model and _make_eval_gan_model which are just calling _make_gan_model with the correct mode variable.
Instead _make_gan_model is used directly to create both training and evaluation models.
Furthermore the PR remove an outdated TODO which was resolved in #14723
