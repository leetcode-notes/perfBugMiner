NadamOptimizer throws InvalidArgumentError (incompatible shapes)

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes, but this issue can be replicated by changing one line in the example script word2vec_basic.py
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux CentOS 7, MacOS High Sierra
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.4.0-rc0-21-g1e25994', '1.4.0-rc1'). I also know someone who encountered this in the 1.3 release.
Python version: 2.7.10, 2.7.14
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0 / 6.0
GPU model and memory: Titan X 12gb
Exact command to reproduce:
Change line 190 in tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py to:
optimizer = tf.contrib.opt.NadamOptimizer(1.0).minimize(loss).
Run.

Describe the problem
When I attempt to train a model with tf.controb.opt.NadamOptimizer, TensorFlow crashes with an InvalidArgumentError (Incompatible shapes: [105] vs. [50000]), which is thrown from the optimizer (in my code it's when trying to apply updates to the word embedding table.) It looks like it's trying to apply sparse updates to the embeddings using dense operations, causing a shape mismatch, or something along those lines. AdamOptimizer and LazyAdamOptimizer work fine.
Source code / logs
Traceback can be found here.
The error is easily replicable in the example script word2vec_basic.py.
