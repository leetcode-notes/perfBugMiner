OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.12.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3

Exact command to reproduce: sh build_all_ios.sh

Describe the problem
I am building tensorflow from source for iOS. it crashes when executing
TARGET_NSYNC_LIB=tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_nsync.sh -t ios
First, it looks for a specific version of the iPhoneSimulator (rather than the latest). When I change my symlink to point to the correct version, it crashes saying that <string.h> cannot be found
Note: the previous call to HOST_NSYNC_LIB=tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_nsync.sh` executes correctly
