"The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations" in "Hello, TensorFlow!" program

Opening this with reference to #7500.
Installed TensorFlow 1.0 with reference to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows on Windows 10 and hit the same issue discussed in #7500.  With applying the solution suggested in that thread, the original issue disappeared but got the new warnings:
