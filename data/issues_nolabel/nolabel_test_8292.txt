Update documentation for BN

The documentation code to update moving_mean and moving_variance for BN raise an error with TF 1.0:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'control_flow_ops'

It seems the new way to add dependencies between ops is to use the tf.control_dependencies.
I also attached the updates_op to the train_op instead of total_loss to be more coherent with the associated warning: [...] they need to be added as a dependency to the train_op, example:. It also make more sense as we don't want to update moving_mean when computing the loss on the testing set.
