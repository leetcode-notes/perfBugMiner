Feature Request: support sparse tensor in conv2d operator

It looks like TF doesn't support conv2d as another thread mentioned (#1604). This is critical for us since we are implementing CDSSM (from microsoft https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/www2014_cdssm_p07.pdf). Miscrosoft's library supports it and the training speed is dramatically faster than using TF. So we strongly feel this feature is important.
