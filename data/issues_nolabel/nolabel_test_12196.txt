Add regression tests  and fix some minor bugs

This pull request adds some additional unit tests for the add_n  and accumulate_n operators. I'm adding these tests as preparation for working on #10607 . Specifically, I added tests of the argument validation code in accumulate_n and a test of gradient computation for add_n.
This pull request also fixes two minor bugs that I encountered in the process of adding the unit tests:

accumulate_n ignores its tensor_dtype argument when the operator has only one input. I've added additional error-handling logic to accumulate_n that rejects values of tensor_dtype that are different from the input type.
The  testUnaryOpTest.testComplex64Basic was failing on my Mac because the acosh and asinh functions for single-precision complex floating point are only accurate to 6 decimal places. Under the assumption that 6 significant figures is good enough, I increased the threshold that the test cases use when comparing gradients.

Note that if 6 significant figures is not good enough for acosh and asinh, a more involved fix will be necessary for the second problem.
