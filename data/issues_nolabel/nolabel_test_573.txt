Fixed saver relative paths for `latest_checkpoint`

This would be cleaner if we made all paths listed in the "latest"
file relative to the its directory, allowing the removal of the
added os.path.isabs checks.
That would make the os.join in saver.latest_checkpoint much less
surprising.
But at least this way, there is no effect on currently working code.
Fixes #571
