Feature request: tf.Print should either print (not log), or accept a log level

Feature Request
Currently tf.Print produces INFO logs.
If log level is set to get rid of INFO logs (given the noise level), it renders tf.Print as non-functional.
It would be nice to have tf.Print work either by making it actually work like print(), i.e. it is not a mechanism to generate logs, or if it should remain that way, then have it accept a log level optional parameter.
