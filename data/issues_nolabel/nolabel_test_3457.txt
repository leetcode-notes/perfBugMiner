Problem in distributed tensorflow demo?

Environment info
Operating System:
Kubernetes (using the 0.8.0 server image)
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
No
When I start the mnist_replica demo, it stuck after prepare_or_wait_for_session
But if I run start_queue_runners for both chief worker and all other workers, it runs successfully. (By removing and is_chief part here and here)
Is this a bug in the demo?
