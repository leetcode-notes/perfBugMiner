bazel build error for PolymerElements

I am trying to build tensorflow from source, and bazel is giving some unrelated error
eddie7@albus:~/lab/tensorflow$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
eddie7@albus:~/lab/tensorflow$ ~/lab/bazel/bazel-bin/src/bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
.......
ERROR: /home/eddie7/lab/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorboard/bower/BUILD:3:1: no such package '@iron-validatable-behavior//': https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior.git: cannot open git-upload-pack and referenced by '//tensorflow/tensorboard/bower:bower'.
ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.

FYI: I have also build bazel from source
