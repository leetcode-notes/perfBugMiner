Error importing tensorflow

I had a problem with the cifar10 example. When running cifar10_eval.py I got:
"AttributeError: 'ExponentialMovingAverage' object has no attribute 'variables_to_restore'"
I then saw #802 and tried to follow the instructions for "Installing from sources" on the website. Now I get a new error when trying to import tensorflow:
Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.
How do I solve this? I'm using ubuntu 15.04.
