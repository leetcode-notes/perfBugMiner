Describe the problem
It seems that the same feature column creates two tensors for DNNLinearCombinedRegressor (see voc_embed in graph below). Is this the right behavior we expected?
The behavior stems from that feature column is processed by DNN and Linear independently, see code: dnn and linear
Source code / logs
# coding: utf-8
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import feature_column as fc

f = fc.embedding_column(
        fc.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list("voc", ["a", "b"]),
        dimension=8)
e = tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedRegressor(
        model_dir="/tmp/tf/test_dnn",
        linear_feature_columns=[f],
        dnn_feature_columns=[f],
        dnn_hidden_units=[10])

def input_fn():
    return ({"voc": tf.identity(
                        tf.constant(["a", "b", "a"], name="voc_input"),
                        name="identity")},
            tf.constant([1, 0, 1]))

e.train(input_fn, steps=10)
