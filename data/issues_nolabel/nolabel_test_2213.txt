Add support for 3d convolutions

This patch is a WIP, but adds functionality for 3d convolutions as requested in #150.
Approach
This patch adds 3d kernels and glue code, largely based off the 2d kernels, as separate modules. We add conv_3d, conv3d_ops, conv3d_grad_ops, and others to the original conv_2d, conv_ops, and conv_grad_ops, which remain unchanged.
As there is logic in the 2d kernels which the 3d kernel simply replicates, this patch is quite large. Generalizing the conv operator to n dimensions might solve 1d and 4d use cases (#1661 and #1136) as well as reducing the overall quantity of code in the codebase.  As this patch includes a comprehensive test suite, this patch should help if or when that happens.
Progress

 Test suite for GPU/CPU
 CPU kernel implementation
 GPU kernel implementation

Currently, there are ~40 tests in tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/conv3d_ops_test.py which test shapes, outputs, strides, and gradients for a variety of input. They pass on my CPU instance:

I currently lack access to a GPU so I haven't worked on the GPU kernel yet, but hopefully that should happen soon.
Todo
This is a learning project for me, so I'd love to get feedback on how this might become more helpful, or how it might fit in better with the TF team's architectural design.  Thanks!
