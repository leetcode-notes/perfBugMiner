Feature request: Tensorflow lite on memory constrained bare-metal systems

I'm interested in running Tensorflow Lite on devices with limited memory resources and possibly no operating systems abstractions available.
This means removing any dependencies on file systems, threads, synchronization primitives, etc. and keeping the binary size as small as possible. I don't know if you discuss your roadmap openly here, but I'm wondering whether this is something that is planned for TFLite? If not, I may go ahead and try to implement this myself.
