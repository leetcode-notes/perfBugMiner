retrain.py input PNG picture

Hi all,
I try to change the retrain.py from jpeg to png so that I can input the png image. ( replace "jpeg" in the code to "png")
but I got the error 'Requested return_element %r not found in graph_def.' % name)
ValueError: Requested return_element 'DecodePng/contents:0' not found in graph_def.
How to fix it ?
I try input_map={'DecodePng:0': decoded_png} in tf.import_graph_def but decoded_png locate under the create_inception_graph() so I don't know where is the decoded_png to add with "DecodePng:0"
thank you and regards,
Khoa
