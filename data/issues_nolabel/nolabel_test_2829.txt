Can not completely disable GPU & CUDA support.

This only applies to TensorFlow 0.9.
Even if you disable GPU support when configuring TensorFlow, you will still need CUDA to build it. Indeed, Eigen::half (half floats) should only be used when running on a GPU, it's not CPU-compatible.
But they are always used, and this causes exceptions to be thrown if our Eigenversion does not contains the Eigen/src/arch/CUDA folder and headers. (=You don't have CUDA installed).
Thanks for fixing this as fast as possible. If you need some other infos, just ask me.
