Timeline's reported memory usage not properly displayed in Chrome

I am attempting to debug out-of-memory issues using the recently introduced support for timeline:
run_options = tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()
sess.run(..., options=run_options, run_metadata=run_metadata)
train_writer.add_run_metadata(run_metadata, 'step' + repr(i))
tl = timeline.Timeline(run_metadata.step_stats)
trace_file = tf.gfile.Open(name='timeline', mode='w')
trace_file.write(tl.generate_chrome_trace_format(show_memory=True))

The file is generated, but when opened via chrome://tracing/ the memory usage events are not displayed at all, only the names. Moreover, opening such memory section results in the CPU-usage events disappearing as well:


Possibly too many datapoints results in failure to display them?
