tf.flags cannot handle options contain hyphen in the middle.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Cloud ML Engine (maybe Ubuntu)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Pre installed on Google Cloud ML Engine
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):NA
CUDA/cuDNN version:NA
GPU model and memory:NA
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
According to the documentation of Google Cloud ML Engine [1], the ML Engine pass the option --job-dir to the python process and the program should be able to handle --job-dir option.
The snippet shown in the next section can run successfully with TensorFlow 1.4.1 but failed with 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0.rc0.
As a result, I cannot use runtime version 1.5 on Cloud ML Engine with my package using tf.flags to handle option --job-dir.
The support of TensorFlow 1.5.0 on Cloud ML Engine training was released officially just few days before [2].
Source code / logs
Here is a snippet to reproduce the issue.
import tensorflow as tf

tf.flags.DEFINE_string("job-dir", "default", "job dir")

def main(argv):
    print(tf.__version__)
    print(tf.flags.FLAGS.job_dir)

tf.app.run()

Here is the backtrace from :
> python snippent.py --job-dir=foo
1.5.0
