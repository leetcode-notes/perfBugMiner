Can I add a py_func to a queue?

Is it possible to add a custom py_func to load non-image data in a FIFOQueue? It appears that the Queue does not support py_func objects. Specifically can you enqueue a py_func object? When trying this Tensor Flow gives the following error:
tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:909] Unimplemented: Unsupported object type Tensor
I've tried calling set_shape on the py_func output
