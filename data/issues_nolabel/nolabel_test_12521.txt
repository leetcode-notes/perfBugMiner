Describe the problem
The install instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux tell users to install libcudnn 5.1.
I followed these and ended up with the error on
import tensorflow

ImportError: libcudnn.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

So I installed libcudnn 6.0 instead and tensorflow is now working.
My request is for the install instructions to be updated to reflect the move to cudnn 6.0
