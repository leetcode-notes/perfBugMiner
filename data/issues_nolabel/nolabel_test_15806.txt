Can we install tensorflow with a package manager in Linux distro?

As we all know, Tensorflow is a major opensource deeplearning framework to the developers.
BTW, How can we install tensorflow with a package manager such as apt-get (for *.deb), yum/zypper/dnf (for *.rpm)  in Linux distro?

Reference - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds

I could not find related scripts from the above web address. Does tensorflow support 1)  manual compilation with ./tools/ci_build/build/*.sh and 2) pre-built docker-based compilation only?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS 7.0 and Ubuntu 16.04.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Latest version of Tensorflow (form github)
