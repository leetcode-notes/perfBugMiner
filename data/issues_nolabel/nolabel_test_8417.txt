Have mnist.py be controlled by tf.set_random_seed() for testing purposes.

It might be helpful to make the internal random generator within mnist.py be connected to tf.set_random_seed().  Since calling this function is part of the first tutorials to tensorflow, it can be confusing if users try to obtain reproducible results by setting tf.set_random_seed() and seeing that it has no effect (because mnist.py does not comprehend this).
