[XLA] Add a check to the HLO verifier for badly formatted Broadcasts.

This adds a check to the HloVerifier which ensures that the Hlo Broadcast instructions are formatted correctly.  Since they are different from the UserComputation broadcast instructions (and therefore the XLA docs), examples of invalid instructions were appearing in the repo.
Also fix up the two cases where the code was creating invalid broadcasts.
