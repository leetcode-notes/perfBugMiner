do not use caching device at eager mode in tf.contrib.seq2seq.dynamic_decode

tf.contrib.seq2seq.dynamic_decode uses caching device, but caching device is not supported at eager execution mode.
This PR checks if eager execution mode is enabled and avoids using caching device if so.
There is another issue in tf.contrib.seq2seq.dynamic_decode with eager execution mode. tf.contrib.seq2seq.dynamic_decode cannot be run yet with this fix alone. I will report the issue when ready.
