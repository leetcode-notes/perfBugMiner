pip default installs TF1.1 still. On purpose?

On both my Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.10 instances, trying to upgrade with pip still installs 1.1 even though 1.2.0rc0 is quite clearly available there. On ubuntu I managed to get it by forcing the version. Wondering if this is intentional?
Note: Will check again that this is the case on Windows still as it was yesterday.
