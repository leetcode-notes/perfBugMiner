Installation error

While running the sudo bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package, I get the following error:
./tensorflow/python/client/tf_session_helper.h:6:10: fatal error: 'numpy/arrayobject.h' file not found
#include "numpy/arrayobject.h"
         ^
1 error generated.


However, I installed numpy from the source listed and it worked perfectly. Any suggestions?
