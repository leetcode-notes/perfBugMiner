Add tensor support for num_spectrogram_bins in linear_to_mel_weight_matrix

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #16553 where it was not possible to provide num_spectrogram_bins as a tensor or placeholder for linear_to_mel_weight_matrix.
The reason comes from the implementation of _validate_arguments which requires num_spectrogram_bins to be a python int.
However, the validation here is not necessary as num_spectrogram_bins will be passed to math_ops.linspace, which performs the validation anyway.
The validation in math_ops.linspace is done in shape function and in kernel's Compute().
For that it makes sense to remove the validation of num_spectrogram_bins in _validate_arguments so that the issue raised in 16553 could be addressed.
This fix adds a test case to cover the changes. Also, the error case of num_spectrogram_bins < 0 has already been covered in the existing test case:
