Passing config to MonitoredSession when using Estimator Class

While implementing my own Estimator class I noticed that although I supplied a RunConfig with gpu_memory_fraction < 1  all memory was allocated. After some investigation I think this is because the ConfigProto contained in the RunConfig is not passed to the MonitoredTrainingSession.
Changing the argument in line 981 from config=None to config=self.config.tf_config did the trick for me.
