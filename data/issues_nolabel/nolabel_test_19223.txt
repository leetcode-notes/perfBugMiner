Misleading "cupti.h" error message

i am trying to build tensorflow 1.7.1 with cuda support on debian.
While doing so, i received the error message
Cuda Configuration Error: Cannot find cupti.h under /usr/lib/cuda

i symlinked cupti.h to the written location, even copied it there but nothing happened. after reading the buildscript third_party/gpus/cuda_configure.bzl, it became clear that the script did actually not search for cupti.h in /usr/lib/cuda/ but in two subfolders below that one. This error message is disleading and should display the actual path that bazel uses to look up the files.
