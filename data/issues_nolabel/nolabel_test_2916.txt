[Feature] RDMA support for distribued Tensorflow

Tensorflow paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08695v1.pdf) states that Tensorflow supports multiple communication protocols such as gRPC over TCP, and RDMA over Converged Ethernet. Current repo, on the other hand, only has gRPC implementations.
Do you have any plan to introduce RDMA support? It should be beneficial especially for GPU-to-GPU communications across servers.
