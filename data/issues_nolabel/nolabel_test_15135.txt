Solved for MNIST file downloading problem

A lot of folks (#6742, #8126, #8134,#8116) were having trouble regarding this issue. Even I faced it today while writing the MNIST code as the mnist.py was unable to connect with the source url. I downloaded the files and pasted it in the folder containing the code and made some changes in the code which solves the need for connecting it to the website. Hope so this works out.
