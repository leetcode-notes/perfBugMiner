Use `keepdims` and maintain backward compatible for `keep_dims`

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #6815 where
both keepdims and keep_dims were used with inconsistency.
This fix changes related api to keepdims while at the same
time maintain backward compatible for keep_dims so that
use will not be impacted.
