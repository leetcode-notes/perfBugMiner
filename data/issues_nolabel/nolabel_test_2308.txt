Theano-like scan non-sequences

It would be nice to add some functionality that allows passing non-sequences to scan function (introduced in 0.8.0). Theano implements this feature and it is very useful.
The suggested usage could be (pseudocode):
scan(fn=lambda state, c1, c2, el: state+c1+c2+el,
     elems=[10,20,30],
     initializer=[0],
     non_sequences=[1, 2])
The first argument could be the last output (state), then all non_sequences could be passed and, finally, the current input el. The pseudocode above would produce the following operations:
0 +1+2+10 => 13
13+1+2+20 => 26
26+1+2+30 => 59

Unfortunatelly I haven't found any hack that would achieve the same behavior (especially when non_sequences contain objects other than tensors, such as GruCells). Maybe there is some, in that case I would really appreciate some hint :)
I believe that this, together with #2294, would help developers to write their scans equally effectively as they do in theno.
