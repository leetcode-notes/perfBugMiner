Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
tf.check_numerics does not raise error when used in tf.control_dependencies.  The code below should raise error, but it does not in TensorFlow 1.2.0
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(np.nan)
with tf.control_dependencies([tf.check_numerics(x, 'nan')]):
    x = tf.identity(x)

with tf.Session().as_default():
    print(x.eval())
