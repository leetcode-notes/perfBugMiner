How to let tensorflow uses the new installed protobuf?

When I installed tensorflow with "pip install",I meet the "A protocol message was rejected because it was too big (more than 67108864 bytes) ",and I uninstall protobuf with pip,then download a new protobuf,install it with changing 256 << 20 in coded_stream.h as "Readme" said,but the same problem occurred,it seems that tensorflow hasn't used the new protobuf,how could I deal with this problem?
