Add uint32 and uint64 kernel support for `Invert`

This fix adds uint32 and uint64 kernel support for Invert.
In bitwise_ops.cc, uint32 and uint64 have been registered for Invert like other bitwise ops BitwiseAnd/BitwiseOr/BitwiseXor/LeftShift/RightShift.
However, no uint32 and uint64 kernels available for Invert yet.
This fix add uint32 and uint64 kernel for Invert, and adds additional test cases to cover the changes.
