Adding equals and hashCode to Shape.

Hello, I know this is a bit of a simple and trivial pull request.  However, for some other work I'm doing I wanted to compare Shape instances in some tests and I found that it didn't work in the standard way.  Hence this pull request to just add an equals method. It has some tests and also does hashCode because it's a common thing to do at the same time.
