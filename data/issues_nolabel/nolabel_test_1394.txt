#1293 Implement Matrix Trace

As discussed in #1293, this is an attempt to implement matrix trace operator for rank 2 tensors. It only takes tensors with rank 2 (similar to the trace design in Theano). Trace for higher rank tensors requires more discussion on how we want to implement it. One approach is to calculate trace for all rank 2 sub-tensors as numpy. Another is to implement tensor contraction (generalization of trace).
