AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'confusion_matrix'

I am using GPU version of tensorflow 0.12.1 and python3.5 for building a CNN network.
When I am trying to compute confusion matrix it gives me the error.
confusion = tf.confusion_matrix(labels = y_, prediction = y, num_classes = model.No_Classes)
y_ is the input labels that I am giving to the network and y is the output of my CNN network. model.No_Classes = 4 an integer value.
is there package missing in this version ?
