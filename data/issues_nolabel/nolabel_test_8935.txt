Fix broken ./configure on mac because of non-portable sed syntax

Running ./configure on mac complains with the following error:
sed: can't read /tf_configure/d: No such file or directory
According to this SO post the syntax to avoid creating backup files with sed on 10.9+ is without a space between -i ''.
Fixes #9553.
