Describe the problem
I was building tensorflow for iOS and as a part of this, tried running the build_all_ios.sh but it threw some errors. The error is mainly because there are parts in shell script that either attempt to create or move to a directory that is incorrectly referenced. In my case, it was because of spaces in directory names. This is true even for the 'compile_ios_protobuf.sh' script (and harder to detect because of the very verbose log).
I was able to get-around this by modifying both of these shell scripts to include double quotes around
lines that referenced directory paths.
Source code / logs
Few examples lines here:
Line 28 (build_all_ios.sh): 'cd ${SCRIPT_DIR}/../../../' (notice that this will ignore spaces in the directory path, if they exist
Line 35 (compile_ios_protobuf.sh): 'mkdir -p ${LIBDIR}' (this will similarly create a directory at an unexpected path and will not complete compilation)
