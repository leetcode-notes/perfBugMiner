[Feature Request] GCS and S3 support on windows

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Will be required.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows, all versions
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source and binary,
TensorFlow version (use command below): master, and all releases
Python version: python 3+
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce: Install tf on windows, and try anything that reads from GCS or S3

Describe the problem
Currently, TF has no support for GCS and S3 on windows. Because they depend on curl, and we have not worked to make curl build and work on windows. Someone needs to dive in and work through the problems, and the rest should be just removing the windows exceptions for GCS and S3 support in configure.py.
