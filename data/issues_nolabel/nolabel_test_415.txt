'import cifar10' bug

I have inserted simple print('xxx') in cifar10.py and run cifar10_train.py but no 'xxx' is printed.
Examining cifar10_train.py find out 'import cifar10' from different source:
from tensorflow.models.image.cifar10 import cifar10
I changed it to:
import cifar10
and run again, get 'xxx' but crashed the program at the function loss() in cifar10.py saying:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "cifar10_train.py", line 139, in 
tf.app.run()

indices = tf.reshape(tf.range(FLAGS.batch_size), [FLAGS.batch_size, 1])
TypeError: range() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
What's wrong?
