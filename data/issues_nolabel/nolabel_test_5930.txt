base class order for tensorflow distributions

this is a feature request for tf.contrib.distributions. on master (i.e., beyond version r0.11), tensorflow distributions require that the first parent class is Distribution.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/distribution.py#L136-L138
this is a problem for our work with random variables in edward, which requires that random variable classes are first and Distribution is second:
https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/blob/master/edward/models/random_variable.py#L35
https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/blob/master/edward/models/random_variables.py#L33
i chatted with @ebrevdo and @jvdillon about this a few weeks ago. they said it's possible to change. (i'm adding a GitHub issue to formalize the request.) can i help in any way? it is a high priority to fix for edward as it breaks all random variable support.
