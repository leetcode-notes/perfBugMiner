add a new config option sycl_nodouble for SYCL build

When TF is built with SYCL enabled, the SYCL device code is generated
at build time. Currently, all the data types such as float and double
are registered to generate the device code.
The SYCL device code is compiled into SPIR at build time, and then
passed to OpenCL implemenation at runtime. Since double precision is
an optional feature in the OpenCL spec, it is possible that an OpenCL
implemenation does not support double.
To make some platforms without double support work, this new config
option disables double register for SYCL device code.
This patch just changes the cwise_add operation as an example, and
other operations will be changed in future small patches one by one.
