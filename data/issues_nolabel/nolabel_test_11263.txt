Image Retrain Inception only check the own specific category not tensor dataset

I have retrained the inception model from my data set of traffic sign.Its working fine but when I am trying to check other image e.g panda it's resulting with the name of traffic sign with some probabilities.I don't understand why its doing it.I need both tensor-flow data-set and my own category too. My steps:
-I have installed the python 3.5.2 in windows 7
-I installed tensor-flow with pip --install tensorflow
-I download these two files retrain.py to train my data and label_image.py to check image.
