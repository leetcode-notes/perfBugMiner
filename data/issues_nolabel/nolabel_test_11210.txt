Tensorflow execution with HVX failed on Qualcomm 820 Board

@satok16 could you have a look at this error?
I have built the libs and am using Intrinsys 820 Qualcomm board. Tried your troubleshooting procedure to sign as well and put the .so file in /system/lib/rfsa/adsp/. Running hexagon graph gives me the same error :

I have attached my adblogcat output as well here. Thanks.
