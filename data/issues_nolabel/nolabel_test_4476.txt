build errors on missing "//base"

When running ./configure on OS X with CUDA support enabled with bazel 0.3.1-homebrew, these errors occur:
ERROR: /Users/jmhodges/src/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:692:1: no such package 'base': BUILD file not found on package path and referenced by '//tensorflow/core:ios_tensorflow_test_lib'.

ERROR: Evaluation of query "deps((//... union @bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain))" failed: errors were encountered while computing transitive closure.

This seems to be because of targets like "ios_tensorflow_test_lib" and, so on, depending on a //base and //tensorflow/core:android_tensorflow_lib_lite_no_rtti_lite_runtime that do not exist.
Off hand, I'm not able to figure out what this was trying to refer to. Perhaps it used to exist?
