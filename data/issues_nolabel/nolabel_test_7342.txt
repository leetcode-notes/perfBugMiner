Float indexing test fix for Numpy >= 1.12+

This fixes test failure for NumPy 1.12 that does not allow float indexing of arrays. Of course, it makes sense to index arrays using ints anyway, regardless of NumPy support. I assume this wasn't causing problems to people with NumPy up to 1.11.3, but it's better not to assume a specific NumPy version.
