Add a collections attribute to node_def

This updates add_to_collection method in the Python API to update (or create) a ListValue of collections in the attr map of each node def. This has been prescribed by @jameswex to solve Issue #3495, in order to have tensorboard show the collections that a node belongs to in the node info box.
