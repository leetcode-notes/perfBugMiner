missing return statement at end of non-void function

Since TensorFlow uses C++11 I think it would be good style to fix the errors such as:
framework/allocator.h(155): warning: missing return statement at end of non-void function "tensorflow::Allocator::RequestedSize"

The code is not harmful in this instance but the compiler would have to parse and trust comments:
// CHECK dies with a fatal error if condition is not true.  It is *not*
// controlled by NDEBUG, so the check will be executed regardless of
// compilation mode.
A simple patch for the problem would be:
  virtual size_t RequestedSize(void* ptr) {
    CHECK(false) << "allocator doesn't track sizes";
  }
-->
  virtual size_t RequestedSize  [[ noreturn ]] (void* ptr) {
    CHECK(false) << "allocator doesn't track sizes";
  }
