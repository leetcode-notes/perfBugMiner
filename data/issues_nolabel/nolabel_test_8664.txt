SyntaxError: name '_googletest_temp_dir' is used prior to global declaration

I am following tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining
The code successfully complied with Bazel but failed to run with command
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir ~/flower_photos
With a very strange ERROR:

Traceback (most recent call last):

When I run the retrain.py directly with python, the error did not show up. It only happens when I use bazel. Can anyone explain why?
