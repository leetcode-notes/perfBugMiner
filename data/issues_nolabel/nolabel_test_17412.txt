Docker Jupyter: Update deprecated softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits

The current Jupyter Notebook included in the Docker image 3_mnist_from_scratch.ipynb uses the deprecated tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits.
This PR updates that Jupyter Notebook to use the new tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2.

I ran it to make sure everything works, but I didn't commit the changes in the cells because the image style looks a bit different, and that would create changes in the diff of the images in the Notebook. This way it should be easier for you to see the exact change.
If you want me to, I can run the cells and commit the new output (with changes in image style and size, but same content).
