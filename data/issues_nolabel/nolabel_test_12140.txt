[XLA] Assert when running XLA unit test

If I run the test //tensorflow/compiler/xla/tests:tuple_test_cpu with a VLOG level of >=2 , then I receive the following assert:
Check failed: current_id >= 0 (-1 vs. 0)-1: 0x7ff6b960bd60: instruction may not have parent computation

I don't think that this is due to any changes that I have in my own repo.
