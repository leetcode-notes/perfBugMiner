Updated iOS build to handle threading correctly, requires iOS 9 or later

There was a long-standing issue with Apple's version of clang not supporting thread local attributes, which are used inside Eigen in some places. As a 'temporary' hack, I defined these attributes out of existence, but this lingered for a lot longer than it should have, and I believe is the cause of issues like #12298. From comments there testing this fix, it looks like it does help.
iOS 9 and later support thread_local, so as an improvement this change moves to that. It will block building on older versions, but now that v11 is almost out I think supporting two versions back should be ok for most developers (though feedback is welcome if I'm wrong).
