Make `frame` positions configurable

This also fixes a bug in get_root_dir_with_all_resources.
The value of sys._getframe(1) is caller-sensitive.
This leads to unexpected bugs where it gives the path of the wrong file.
For example, get_root_dir_with_all_resources is supposed to find the runfiles directoy.
But because of the extra call to get_data_files_path, everything shifts by one and now it resolves all paths on the location of the resource_loader.py file loaded (repository or PIP, but not a runfiles path). In the places it's used currently, it doesn't break anything, tho.
This PR fixes the behavior of get_root_dir_with_all_resources and makes the frame positions configurable on all methods (with a default for compatibility).
@martinwicke Friendly ping.
