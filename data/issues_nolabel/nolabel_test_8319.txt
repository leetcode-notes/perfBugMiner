Update macOS GPU installation instructions

Environment info
Operating System: macOS 10.12
Tensorflow: 1.0
CUDA/cuDNN: 8.0, 5.1

I was setting up Tensorflow with GPU, reading the instructions: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac. It seems that a few things can be made clearer. I'm not sure where the source for the website lives so I want to file an issue so it can possibly be updated and people searching for related issues can have a pointer.
The issues are with the Requirements to run TensorFlow with GPU support section.

It mentioned that one should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH according to NVIDIA docs, but NVIDIA docs only asks to specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, which actually doesn't work. Can we say on the website how exactly it should be set?
Same for cuDNN. The linked page actually has no instruction about how to install cuDNN. It may be useful to put on the website that the include and lib files should be manually copied over to /usr/local/cuda.
The following should be run to avoid segfault: sudo ln -sf /usr/local/cuda/lib/libcuda.dylib /usr/local/cuda/lib/libcuda.1.dylib.

The paths for 1 should be:
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/lib/
export PATH="/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/bin:${PATH}"
