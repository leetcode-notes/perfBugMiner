tf.metrics.mean_relative error doesn't handle complex inputs

The offending line is here:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/metrics_impl.py
    
    
         Line 1057
      in
      9c4bdb8
    
    
    
    

        
          
           relative_errors = array_ops.where( 
        
    
  


array_ops.where expects the second and third inputs to be of the same shape and type. Unfortunately, when the labels input is complex, array_ops.zeros_like(labels) returns an (unnecessarily) complex tensor, whereas the third input returns a float tensor.
I haven't checked, but suspect similar problems might occur with other metrics (and perhaps elsewhere).
