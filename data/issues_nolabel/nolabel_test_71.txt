Can't install from source if I don't have a GPU?

My os X: EI Captian version 10.11.1
I tried install from the source. However, running "$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg" this make me error.  I got following error message. I think I don't have a GPU in my mac. Is there anyway that I can isnstall from source even though I don't have a GPU ?
