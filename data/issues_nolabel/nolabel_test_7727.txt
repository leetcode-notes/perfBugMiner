when will tf.contrib.distributions move into tf core? Is this planned?

Hi,
I'm working with distributions a lot in my own library built upon tensorflow. However, I found the api provided in tf.contrib.distributions are subject to change very often, which makes it quite difficult to keep up and maintain a stable codebase.
So I'd like to ask whether tf.contrib.distributions is going to the tensorflow core library and how is this planned. Will you recommend to keep using it or just build my own distributions?
Best,
Jiaxin
