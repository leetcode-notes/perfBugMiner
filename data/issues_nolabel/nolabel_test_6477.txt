Sub Matrices, Partitioned Matrices and composite matrices through view on undeling data

There are times you want to address portions of a vector or matrix separately and also combine matrices and vectors to form new matrices. Essentially these matrices would be  view on the original data.
E.g.
Concatenate 2 matrices to create a view
Sub current matrix into smaller n * n matrices returning view on the sub matrices
