tf.contrib.rnn.GLSTMCell is hilariously broken

In 3f57902 an "if" was added that caches linear transformation weights:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.5/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/ops/rnn_cell.py#L2316
The problem is that this _linear is inside a loop. And so the change tied weights of all these linear transformations.
