Applying dropout in Tensorflow C++ API

I have retrained Inception-v3 model using (Tensorflow) Python API and saved a standalone Graph in .pb form. I have also used a dropout layer before the final layer. I can successfully run inference on the graph in python. The code to generate predictions in python is as follows:
softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_layer/final_result/Softmax:0')
predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, { 'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data, 'final_layer/dropout/Placeholder:0': 1.})

The C++ counterpart of the python code is as follows:
string input_layer = "Mul"; 
string output_layer = "final_layer/dropout/Placeholder:0";
Status run_status = session->Run({{input_layer, resized_tensor}}, {output_layer}, {}, &outputs);

The C++ code ends up with the following error message:
Running model failed: Invalid argument: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'final_layer/dropout/Placeholder'
What should I change in the above C++ code to remove this error? In other words, how do I change a placeholder value in the C++ code as in python code.
