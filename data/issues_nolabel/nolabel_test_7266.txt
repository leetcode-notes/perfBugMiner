undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string'

Hello,
I am tring to do install core of tensorflow on Raspberry PI 3, on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python 3.5.2, exactly following the instruction on https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile, but got error messages at last step "make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI OPTFLAGS="-Os" CXX=g++-4.8".
Note that I tried the method shared on  https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi, but there are also error occured.
I am wondering is it due to some update of tensorflow? Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!
