LSTM's forget gate biases

Hi all,
I was looking into the LSTMCell code and I got confused:
Line 505 show us the computations of new input and the gates: input, forget and output.
Both line 517 and line 520 show the addition of the forget gate (which is a scalar in this particular piece of code).
I got confused by this addition as it seems to be already done when we split the gate's values  in line 505 as mentioned before. Am I missing something or is this a second addition to the forget gate computations? If it is a second addition, wouldn't that change the computations?
By the way, that bias shouldn't be a vector instead of a single scalar?
Sorry if I am saying nonsense. but I'd like to double check that before saying it is a bug.
