In this doc we discuss the Head API, which helps users define customizable
models that follow the tf.estimator API. The API
includes:

A Head interface.
Factory methods to create common heads, such as regression head.
A multi_head method that combines more than one heads for multi-objective
learning.
Canned estimators that can use those heads.

The API is already exposed under tf.contrib.estimator. The code is in
tensorflow/contrib/estimator/python/estimator/head.py,
tensorflow/contrib/estimator/python/estimator/multi_head.py and
tensorflow/python/estimator/canned/head.py, and an earlier (deprecated)
version is exposed under tf.contrib.learn. The goal of this design doc is to
graduate the API from contrib to core.
