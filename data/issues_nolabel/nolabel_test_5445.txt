tf.gather doesn't run on GPU for DT_INT32

As I know, tf.gather should be able to operate on a GPU device according to this issue: #2502
I installed the latest version of r0.11 branch (commit hash written below) and ran the following code:
    import tensorflow as tf
    x = tf.constant([1,2,3,4,5])
    idx = tf.constant([0,1,2,3,4])
    with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
        y = tf.gather(x, idx)
    sess = tf.Session()
    print(sess.run(y))
and it returned the following error message:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'Gather': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
     [[Node: Gather = Gather[Tindices=DT_INT32, Tparams=DT_INT32, validate_indices=true, _device="/device:GPU:0"](Const, Const_1)]]

If I change '/gpu:0' into '/cpu:0', it works well. Can you give me any hint on this?
