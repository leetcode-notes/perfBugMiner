sparsemax implementation is not infinite-safe

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes, but I have a simple reproducer below


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Fedora 27


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip3 install --user tensorflow


TensorFlow version (use command below):  1.4.0


Python version: 3.6.3


Bazel version (if compiling from source): no


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): no


CUDA/cuDNN version: no


GPU model and memory: no (x86_64 CPU)


Exact command to reproduce:


Describe the problem
tf.contrib.sparsemax.sparsemax does not produce the correctly expected results when infinities are present in the input.
Mathematically, a negative infinity should be treated the same as a very large negative number, and produce a 0 in the output.
This is a real-world problem when sparsemax is combined with contrib.seq2seq.LuongAttention (as suggested in its documentation, and also as suggested in the sparsemax paper), because entries past the input length in the batch will have a score of -inf by default.
