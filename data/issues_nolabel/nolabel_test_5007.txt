Update classify_image.py code to use latest pre-trained model

The code in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py references the older pre-trained model at http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz however, a new pre-trained model is available at http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-v3-2016-03-01.tar.gz and is referenced in other parts of the code tree (such as https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception).
Please update the code in classify_image.py to reflect the latest pre-trained  model.
