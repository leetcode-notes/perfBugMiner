Feature request: Have Estimator display Loss and Metrics for Every Epoch and not Every Step

Most of the papers I’ve read measure the time it takes to train a model with every epoch and not every step. If it isn’t possible to display the loss only for every epoch, I think it would be nice to print when an epoch has passed.
