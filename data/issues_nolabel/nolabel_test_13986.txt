tensorflow building graph very slow â€” for more than two hours when looping

Describe the problem
Tensorflow is really slow when using loops. A very simple code can even last for hours and this is strange.
Can anyone help me with issue?
Source code / logs
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# define a guassian function so that it picks a value of 1 when the required value is met and otherwise a small neglegible value
def gaussian(x_box, x_tensor):
    x_box=tf.convert_to_tensor(x_box,dtype=tf.float32)
    return tf.exp(tf.divide(tf.square(x_box-x_tensor),-0.02))

a=time.time()
# the input tensor with shape=[1,1000]
length = 1000
input_= tf.placeholder(dtype= tf.float32, shape= [1, length])


# the box length is 100
box=np.zeros(100, dtype='O')
#zero_tensor=tf.convert_to_tensor(0,dtype=tf.float32)
#box[:]=zero_tensor


# in order to put the element in the correct box, I use a gaussian function, so that when the element
# in input_ is  near the box , it contributes a large number
for i in range(length):
    for j in range(len(box)):
        box[j] += gaussian(j, input_[0][i])
b=time.time()
print(b-a)

##########
# really slow when length=1000 and box len 100, but if I set length =10 and box len also 10
# it get the correct ansewr and faster as expected
# for example
input_value = [[0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]]
with tf.Session() as sess:
    for i in range(len(box)):
        box[i] = int(sess.run(box[i], {input_: input_value}))
print(box)
