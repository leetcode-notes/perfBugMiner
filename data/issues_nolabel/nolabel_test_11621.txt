WARNING:tensorflow:Input graph does not contain a QueueRunner. That means predict yields forever. This is probably a mistake.

I have built a Custom Estimator, and I created an input function using the Datasets API when I call:
estimator.predict(input_fn)
I see the following Warning:
WARNING:tensorflow:Input graph does not contain a QueueRunner. That means predict yields forever. This is probably a mistake.
The input function looks like this:
def get_input_fn(review, word_to_id):
  """Create a Input function for classify_sentiment_analysis.py.

   Args:
      review (str): review sentence
      word_to_id (list): list with all words represented in the embedding.
                         The index is the word index in the embedding.

   Return: sequence of indexes that map that words to the embedding.

  """
  def _word_to_index(sequence):
    """Convert a sequence of words into a sequence of integers."""
    id_sequence = []
    UNK = 399999 # vector for unkown words
    for word in sequence:
      if word in word_to_id:
        id_sequence.append(word_to_id.index(word))
      else:
        id_sequence.append(UNK)
    return np.array(id_sequence)

  def input_fn():
    """Input function."""
    # make review a sequence of words
    review_split = review.split(' ')
    # converting words to indexes
    review_id = _word_to_index(review_split)
    # calculates the length of the sequence
    x_len = len(review_split)
    # creates the dataset from in memory data
    ds = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_tensors(review_id)
    # the model expects a batch
    ds = ds.batch(1)

    # creates iterator
    x = ds.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next()

    dict_x = {'x': x, rnn_common.RNNKeys.SEQUENCE_LENGTH_KEY: [x_len]}
    # no label needed since we're only using this input function for prediction
    # if training make sure to return a label
    return dict_x, None

  return input_fn

Thank you!
