Describe the problem
can't  feed the multi-channel to audio_spectrogram()
the error is
Spectrogram size calculation failed:Expected height 98 but got 100
if use [16000, 1] at line 29 in my below code, the result is ok. no error. It means only accept one channel.
I read the code at:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/spectrogram_op.cc
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/spectrogram.cc
I think the error is :
samples_to_next_step_ and  input_queue_ is modified when calculation for each channel.
But Spectrogram don't initialized these two variable at each channel,
