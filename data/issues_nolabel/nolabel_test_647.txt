Cannot import tensorflow under python

Hi all, I first successfully installed the tensorflow following the instructions of "Pip Installation". However, I couldn't import tensorflow in Python. Thanks a lot!!
The error comes like this:
zhuotun@sunformoon:~$ python
Python 2.7.11 |Anaconda 2.4.1 (64-bit)| (default, Dec  6 2015, 18:08:32)

import tensorflow as tf
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named tensorflow



I double check that I have installed successfully the tensorflow by re-installing the tensorflow as following:
zhuotun@sunformoon:~$ sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.6.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
