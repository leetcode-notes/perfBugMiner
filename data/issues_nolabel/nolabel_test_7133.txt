Loading Files with New Tensorflow

Using newest version of Tensorflow on Linux.
Ok so I had a working Saver.restore going for literally months and everyone was fine:
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.restore(sess, "deep_tweet_lstm_w-300000")
deep_tweet_lstm_w-300000 was the name of the file with the data points.
Ever since updating my Tensorflow I get this error:
NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to find any matching files for deep_tweet_lstm_w-300000
I honestly find this change infuriating, how in the world do I load this file with the new Tensorflow?
