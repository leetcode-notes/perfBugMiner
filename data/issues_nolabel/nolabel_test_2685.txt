ImportError when I use  "from tensorflow.models.rnn import rnn, rnn_cell"

I install tensorflow on a new cluster and try to run program on it.
But I get this error:
ImportError("This module is deprecated. Use tf.nn.rnn_* instead."),
from this line:
from tensorflow.models.rnn import rnn, rnn_cell.
It seems the new version of TF has changed the way to import rnn, but I don't know how to fix it. (version of TF is 0.9)
