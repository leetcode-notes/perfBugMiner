Fix failing build on Fedora 26 (stropts.h)

Tensorflow branches 1.4 and master do not build on Fedora 26. When bazel builds curl as a third-party package, the file stropts.h is always included, while it is no longer present on many Linux distributions (including Fedora). Curl can be easily built without it by removing the HAVE_STROPTS flag.
This problem was already mentioned (tensorflow/serving#320). The solution proposed there is to create an empty /usr/include/stropts.h as root. Because that is not always possible, just removing the HAVE_STROPTS flag seems to be a better solution.
