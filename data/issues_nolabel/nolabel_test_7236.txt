Gradient is incorrect for log pdf of Normal distribution

Am I missing something basic here?
Gradients of the log pdf of normal distributions are zero. I might be going crazy, it is late at night.
In [12]: mu = tf.get_variable('mu', [], 'float32')
In [13]: q = dist.Normal(mu, 1.)
In [14]: log_q = q.log_pdf(q.sample())
In [15]: grad = tf.gradients(log_q, mu)
In [16]: sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
In [17]: sess.run(grad)
Out[17]: [0.0]
In [18]: tf.__version__
Out[18]: '0.12.1'
