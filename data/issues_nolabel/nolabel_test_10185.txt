Unable to create so file

I have got the build file in mytensorflow-master/tensorflow directory. Following is the build file contents
cc_binary(
    name = "libtensorflow.so",
    copts = tf_copts(),
    linkshared = 1,
    linkopts = [
        "-lpthread",
        "-lm",
    ],
    deps = [
        ":cc_ops",
        "//tensorflow/core:kernels",
        "//tensorflow/core:tensorflow",
    ],
)

Executing this build file, throws the following error
/Users/Johnny/Downloads/tensorflow-master/tensorflow/BUILD: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
/Users/Johnny/Downloads/tensorflow-master/tensorflow/BUILD: line 1: `cc_binary('
