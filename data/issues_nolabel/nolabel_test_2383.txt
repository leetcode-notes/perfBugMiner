machine learning beginner: how to get custom input data to train a conv net?

I have started learning tensorflow recently. I am trying to input my custom python code as training data. I have generated random exponential signals and want the network to learn from that. This is the code I am using for generating signal-
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import numpy as np
lorange= 1
hirange= 10
amplitude= random.uniform(-10,10)
t= 10
random.seed()
tau=random.uniform(lorange,hirange)
x=np.arange(t)
plt.xlabel('t=time")
plt.ylabel('x(t)')
plt.plot(x, amplitude*np.exp(-x/tau))
plt.show()`
How can I use this graph as input vector in tensorflow?
