Tensorflow not working properly in Python sub-interperters

System information

Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf on a Python wsgi application written in Flask

Describe the problem
This is a follow-up to a problem that I described in a stackoverflow post today:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49471240/slow-page-loading-on-apache-when-using-flask/49471633#49471633
The summary of the issue is that when trying to import tensorflow in a web application written in Flask and hosted on Apache, the page never loads up because of the tensorflow import.
From the reply, they suggested that Tensorflow, being a C extension does not yet provide proper support to be run on python sub-interpreters.
They also suggested a workaround that worked for me, which was to force wsgi application to run on the primary python process.
I admit that I don't really understand the scope of the problem, but I thought it might be worth mentioning this issue and understand if it is something that could be/should be fixed.
