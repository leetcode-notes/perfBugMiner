tutorials_example_trainer working for cpu not gpu (built from source)

I am trying to install TF from source WITHOUT INTERNET so far I have been able to advance thanks to @damienmg by replacing git repos by local repos for re2,gemmlowp,libpng,jpegsvrc and eigen and modifying WORKSPACE accordingly.
The bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer cmd for tutorials_example_trainer works fine (with a few warnings due to comparison between signed and unsigned entities and index subscript above array bounds).
And bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer produces the expected result.
However when I clean up with bazel clean --expunge and rerun ./configure for GPU support and then run:
bazel build -c opt config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
I get the error messages :
'@gemmlowp//:eight_bit_int_gemm' failed: crosstool_wrapper_driver-is_not_gcc failed: error executing command third_party/gpus/crosstool/cleang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE '-D FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' fstack-protector -fpIE -Wall -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object
or the same with '@re2//:re2'
