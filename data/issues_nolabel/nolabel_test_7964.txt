How to specify the original name of an image using summary.image?

I want to visualize detection results on images using tf.summary.image and record the original name of this image at the same time.
In the old version tf.image_summary(), I can pass a placeholder for an image name and feed the name in sess.run.  Like this,
log_image_data = tf.placeholder(tf.uint8, [None, None, 3])
log_image_name = tf.placeholder(tf.string)
log_image = tf.image_summary(log_image_name, tf.expand_dims(log_image_data, 0), max_images=1)

But the new version of api only allows to speficy a fixed name in string type instead of a placeholder when building the summry graph.
tf.summary.image(name, tensor, max_outputs=3, collections=None) 
# Args: 
# name: A name for the generated node, which cannot be a placeholder

How can I name the visualized image on the fly?
