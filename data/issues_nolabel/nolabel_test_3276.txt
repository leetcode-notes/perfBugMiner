Trouble building from source: import tensorflow fails (from any directory)

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: 7.5/5
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named tensorflow
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: (most recent: b62f19c)

Steps to reproduce

Created an empty conda environment only seeded w/ python 2.7.5 + anaconda
Installed numpy scipy
Correctly configured w/ ./configure
Ran the exact bazel build command provided on the site from root of tensorflow cloned directory
import tensorflow fails (from any directory) AND conda list or pip list do not show tensorflow after installation.  (Yes, I checked to make sure that the ./configure had the right address matching the output of which python)

What have you tried?

Creating new conda env, to see if it would help. Don't have access to virtualenv on my machine nor do I have sudo access.
