Improve severly lacking Trainable.fit() documentation

I'm a beginner, some questions that came to mind after reading it multiple times:

Give examples of x and y, I never got those to work. It either breaks because they have no "dtype" or complains that I should use input_fn instead.
Are x/y supposed to be tensors?
When is input_fn called?
If input_fn returns some kind of "queue" how is it used?
What would you actually expect a "step" to do? (Needed to know estimate a good value of "steps")
How many training examples does each step consume/look at?
Why can't batch_size be specified together with input_fn?
What does batch_size actually do? What is a batch?
Do you always want to do training with limited batch size?

Thanks.
