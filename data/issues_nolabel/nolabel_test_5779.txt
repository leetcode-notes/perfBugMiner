[TensorFlow Mechanics 101]: Add conv layers to this tutorial

It seems the tutorial in TensorFlow Mechanics 101 has more beautiful structure in coding, and as it currently only contains fully connected layers. Is it a good addition to include conv layers ? If so, please leave a short comment and I'll submit a pull request soon.
