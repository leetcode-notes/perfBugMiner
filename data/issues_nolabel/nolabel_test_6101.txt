Feature request - Android example app for Windows tensorflow.

There is now a support of TensorFlow for Windows. I installed it using the instructions provided as part of Anaconda, and it works. However, I can't seem to find information about developing an application with TensorFlow for Android in Windows, by using Android Studio.
I found the path of TensorFlow installation in Windows,  C:\Program Files\Miniconda2\envs\py35\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\contrib\android\java, but it is completely empty.
Is there a chance of getting an example app for Windows Android Studio?
I've also asked it on stackeoverflow, but didn't get any answer yet.
I am asking it here because it looks like the example has not been developed yet.
