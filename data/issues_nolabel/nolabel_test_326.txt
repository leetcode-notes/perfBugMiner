bazel should be optional when building from source

nobody likes a complicated compile and installation process.  its great that to get started users can easily pip install tensorflow, but its not great that to do a full recompile they need to install bazel.
Jim F. has a great tutorial here for using tensorflow directly from c++, https://medium.com/jim-fleming/loading-a-tensorflow-graph-with-the-c-api-4caaff88463f#.ruuyvd9ae
but for users like me on Fedora, installing bazel is unsupported, so its a major disappointment not being able to try Jim's tutorial.
cmake is probably a better choice for alternate build system, because that is easy to use on any type of linux.  The cmake build script could be super stripped down and not include building the python wrappers, because most people building from source are embedding into their own apps, and only use python to create and train their graphs.
