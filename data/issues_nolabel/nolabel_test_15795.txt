configure.py environment variables

Have I written custom code: No
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux (Any?)
TensorFlow installed from: Source
TensorFlow version: 1.4 (Master Branch)
Bazel version: 0.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A
System information

Building from source
Branch Master (currently d87a9fb)

Describe the problem
Line 1353 of configure.py needs to have int( ) wrapped around the function get_var, otherwise the string that is returned always flags positive and setting TF_SET_ANDROID_WORKSPACE=0 environment variable to avoid user interaction in building from source will never work.
