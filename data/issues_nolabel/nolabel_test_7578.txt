cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py is mentioned in the tutorial, but doesn't exist in the source tree

cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py was removed in the 1.0, but still exists in the docs:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn
Where can users find examples for multi-GPU/distributed training compatible with v1.0?
