Let cosine_distance work across multiple axes

This change lets users use cosine_distance to directly compute the cosine distance between n-dimensional tensors. Currently this requires reshaping the input tensors to 1D before calling cosine_distance. Other loss functions don't require reshaping, so it would be nice to remove this little bit of cognitive overhead.
I also added tests for cosine_distance, for both 1- and 2-dimensional cases.
