Feature request: Profiling with multiple workers in distributed settings and visualizing them individually

Hi,
I am running Tensorflow in distributed settings only using CPUs with multiple workers and parameter servers. I would like to find a way to generate timeline information of individual workers/parameter servers and visualize them together to check on potential scaling issues.
Currently, I can generate timeline traces containing the profiles of all the parameter servers and a single worker.  But, visualizing all the workers in the same timeline trace would be beneficial.
Thank you.
