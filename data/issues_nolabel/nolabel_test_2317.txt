Install the latest version whl of tensorflow from Jenkins daily build system, but can not find a part of the directory。
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.

first download the latest stable package:
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-matrix-cpu/TF_BUILD_CONTAINER_TYPE=CPU,TF_BUILD_IS_OPT=OPT,TF_BUILD_IS_PIP=PIP,TF_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON2,label=cpu-slave/lastStableBuild/

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".




import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)
0.8.0



Steps to reproduce

pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install  --upgrade  tensorflow-0.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

What have you tried?

in  the  path anaconda2\envs\tensorflow\lib\python2.7\site-packages\tensorflow\models\image dictionary，can not find the alexnet and imagenet dictionary, but can find them from the github path https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/models/image.
