./configure modifies build_config.bzl which is version-controlled

Configure modifies build_config.bzl that is tracked by version control. This causes following annoyances:

When you do git pull, it'll overwrite build_config.bzl after which you need to do a ./configure and rebuild. I sometimes do testing of the same change on Mac and Unix host, and use git pull to sync them, which will overwrite my machine-specific config with default value.
You can't use git commit -a because that'll include build_config.bzl

Current work-around for 1. is to do following when pulling:
git stash
git pull
git stash pop

If you merge failed message, do
git checkout --theirs -- tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config.bzl

For 2. it's possible to use skip-worktree
@aselle what do you thinking about adding build_config.bzl to .gitignore?
