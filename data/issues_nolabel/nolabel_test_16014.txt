Error While Importing Tensorflow 1.5 RC0 with CUDA 9.1

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 64-bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5 RC0
Python version: 3.6.3 (via Anaconda)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.1/7.0.5
GPU model and memory: GTX 1050 4GB (notebook version)
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow (from a Python shell)

Describe the problem
The installation of the CUDA, cuDNN and Tensorflow went smoothly. When I import tensorflow I get the error pasted below. CUDA and CUDA_PATH_V9_1 were automatically set by the installer to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.1.
Installation instructions used:
CUDA: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html#windows
(steps 7 to 10 ignored, because it involved downloading nearly 6 GB for a test. Is it required? I haven't installed TF in Windows before.)
cuDNN: http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html
(step 5 ignored as I didn't have a Visual Studio project - is there a VS project in the context of Tensorflow?)
Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
(pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0rc inside a conda environment)
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
