No OpKernel for DepthwiseConv2dNative

When trying to run inference of tf graph by means of benchmarking tool, I'm getting error that indicates absence of DepthwiseConv2dNative op.
I'm building and running benchmark tool as it described in Tensorflow Makefile
Run command:
adb shell '/data/local/tmp/benchmark --graph=/data/local/tmp/optimized_inference_graph.pb --input_layer="model/input_node:0" --input_layer_shape="1,256,256,3" --input_layer_type="float" --output_layer="output:0" '
I found this op as unsupported here. If it is related to this issue, I'm wondering if there is an upcoming patch to support this op? Or maybe there is a way to circumvent it?
Error log:
Could not create TensorFlow Session: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DepthwiseConv2dNative' with these attrs.  Registered kernels:
