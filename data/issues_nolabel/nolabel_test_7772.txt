where is the gradient computation of a variable in cpu

There are some variables of a neural network. Some are in GPU, and some are in CPU. For the variables in CPU, where are their gradients computed? CPU or GPU?
For example, where is the gradient of c computed?
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
  a = tf.get_variable("a", [100, 3])
  b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
  with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
  d = tf.matmul(b,c)
Thanks very much.
