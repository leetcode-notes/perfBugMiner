ImportError: No module named core.framework.graph_pb2

Hello, I am trying to build tensorflow from source without CPU support. When I try to import it in python I am getting the error "ImportError: No module named core.framework.graph_pb2".
I have tried this on Arch Linux AND on Ubuntu which gives me the impression I might be doing something wrong. However I am exactly following the instructions on the TF homepage.
I would appreciate any help!!
Environment info
Operating System: Arch Linux
Commit hash: 263d00d
Steps to reproduce

./configure
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
python2
import tensorflow

What have you tried?

I made sure I am not in the build directory
I have uninstalled protobuf and reinstalled it
I have reinstalled six
I tried with different versions of protobuf
I tried the same on Ubuntu 15.04 -> getting the same error ()

Logs or other output that would be helpful
