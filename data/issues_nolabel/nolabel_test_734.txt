failed to enqueue convolution on stream: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM

Hi guys,
I'm just trying to run the Deep MNIST example on my GeForce GTX 980Ti (it worked on the CPU) but am getting the above mentioned error message during the training phase. Can anyone point me to the right direction what might be wrong?
Here's what ipython notebook outputs on my Ubuntu 14.04 system with CUDA 7.0, cuDNN 6.5 and NVIDIA drivers version 352.39 (linux-x86_64): http://pastebin.com/f4y3c9CH
Thanks
