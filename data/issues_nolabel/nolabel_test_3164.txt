Add Float64 support to CTC Decoder Ops

PR incomplete! Have question about best way to get around one line
Chipping away at ops listed in #1140
This PR adds 64-bit floating point support for CTCGreedyDecoder and provides tests for it. However, CTCDecoderBeamSearch doesn't have support yet, as there's a line that needs to be changed, and I need help with it. What would be the best way to dynamically select the correct DataType here? Currently DT_FLOAT is hard-coded in, but it should be DT_DOUBLE when the template type is double. Thanks!
