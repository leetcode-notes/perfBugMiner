If installed from binary pip package, provide:



import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)
1.0.1



If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
adder_node = a + b  # + provides a shortcut for tf.add(a, b)

print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: 3, b:4.5}))
print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: [1,3], b: [2, 4]}))

Expected result should be
7.5
[ 3.  7.]

It seems, tensorflow reads uninitialized memory, because sometimes it prints some random numbers.
