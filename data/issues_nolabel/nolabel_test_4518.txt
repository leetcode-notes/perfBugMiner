GPU kernel for MatrixTriangularSolve

A feature request. This should be possible without too much disruption because it relies on a CUBLAS call and therefore would not require changes to stream_executor, see section 3.4.6 of the linked document.

The requisite blas function is called cublasStrsm and seems to be already in stream executor in this file

I know that @rmlarsen has been interested in this sort of area in the past.
I don't think it is possible to do this as a user op added at run time because stream executor is not part of the tf includes in the binary, but I'd be happy to be wrong.
