how to assign a tensor to a sub part of another tensor

Hi, dear all,
I am new to tensorflow. Previously I use theano. Now I want to assign a tensor to a sub part of another tensor. e.g.:
a =
[[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0]]
b =
[[1],
[3],
[4].
[5]]
I would assign to a[0,:], like this
a =
[[1,0,0,0],
[3,0,0,0],
[4,0,0,0],
[5,0,0,0]]
in theano we use set_subtensor, what should I do with tensorflow? Thank you very much!
