No module named 'gen_word2vec' and missing tf.models

I got two problems with tensorflow, which was built today from source. My OS is Mac.
1.I was trying to run the code here https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py, but received an error:
ImportError: No module named 'gen_word2vec'
Could anyone help explain where I could find the gen_word2vec.py?
2. Another problem is that I couldn't import tensorflow.models anymore:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'models'
The information of my tensorflow is here:
