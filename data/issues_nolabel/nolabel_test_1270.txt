User ops documentation not sufficient

I followed the documentation for building a user ops (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/adding_an_op/index.html),
trying the zero_out op, there are a couple of places where the doc is not clear and also after hacking my way around it the op failed to work.
I am following the instructions for adding an op with Tensorflow source installation.
Here are the questions:
1- Where should the bazel build rule be placed?
2- How to exactly use bazel to build the op?
I appreciate if you can clarify the documentation, it will help a lot.
