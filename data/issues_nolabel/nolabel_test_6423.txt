Swift 3 wrapper around c interface.

From comments here @rxwei

It's apparent that the c wrapper is limited - and there's no feature parity matching python api.
In order to progress swift - we need more of the python functionality to be ported to c interface.
Or a path forward using the services layer.
I wonder if this c porting could be done automagically using some off the shelf library?
