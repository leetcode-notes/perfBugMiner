TensorFlow iOS apps crash at launch on iPhone 4s/iPhone 5 simulators

Running the simple iOS example provided by this repository will crash if I target any iPhone 4s/iPhone 5 simulator. The app will crash immediately at launch, before entering didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. The last call I can identify in the debugger is usually tensorflow::internal::LogMessageFatal::~LogMessageFatal:.
The crashes happen on iPhone 5 simulators running iOS 10.2, 9.3, and 9.1. And on iPhone 4s simulators running iOS 9.3, 9.1, and 8.4.
I can reproduce this behavior with other TensorFlow iOS apps.
The same apps that crash in an iPhone 4s/iPhone 5 simulator, will build & run fine on other simulators & devices, e.g. on iPad Air simulator running 10.2, a physical iPad Air running 10.2, or physical iPhone 6s Plus running 10.2. Tests on a device farm including iPhone 4s & iPhone 5 devices were inconclusive… I’m seeing a very similar crash happen, mostly affecting devices running 9.3.5, but the devices/iOS combos that fail on physical devices are slightly inconsistent from run to run (in the simulator the same devices crash 100% of the time no matter what OS I use, and from run to run).
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
This issue is the only hit I get, but seems unrelated.

Minimal reproducible example

Prepare the simple iOS example provided by Tensorflow
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
$ cd tensorflow
$ tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh
$ tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh
$ open tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/simple/tf_ios_makefile_example.xcodeproj

Download the Inception graph per the instructions
Target the iPhone 5 simulator on iOS 10.2, and Run.
The app will crash before entering didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
(If you target the iPad Air simulator on iOS 10.2, it will work.)
