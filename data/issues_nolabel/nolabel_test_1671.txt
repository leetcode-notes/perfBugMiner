Tensorboard does not list any event

Tensorboard does not list any event stored in disk.
Environment info
Operating System: Docker on Windows 10
Tensorflow version 0.7.1
Steps to reproduce
graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default(), tf.device('/cpu:0'):
  a = tf.constant(5.0)
  b = tf.constant(6.0)
  c = a * b

  # Enter data into summary.
  c_summary = tf.scalar_summary("c", c)
  merged = tf.merge_all_summaries()

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:
  writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter("log/test_logs", session.graph_def)

  result = session.run([merged])
  tf.initialize_all_variables().run()
  writer.add_summary(result[0], 0)

I then ran tensorboard --logdir={absolute path to log/test_logs} but no event was listed there. Is there anything I should have written differently in the code maybe?
Note that log/test_logs does contain files like events.out.tfevents.1459102927.0a8840dee548.
What have you tried?
Running https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.7/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py did not correct this (despite the events correctly outputted to disk).
