concurrent.futures for Python 2 installed with tensorflow-gpu with pip3

We noticed an issue with the tensorflow-gpu package available in pip for Python 3: it leads to concurrent.futures for Python 2 being installed as a dependency.
$ jupyter-notebook --no-browser

The workaround is to remove concurrent.futures as it is already included in Python 3 standard library.
