Feature: Add dependency version

Tensor examples :
tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/adding_an_op/
do not come with version of TensorFlow.
So, as tensorFlow API is still changing a lot, breaks appear when:
using older-examples  with new TF
new examples with older TF.
Please provide versionning for example scripts:

Example of versioning in the comments of the example script:
(to ensure we can reproduce it) :
'''
Script MNIST
TensorFlow  1.0.1
Numpy   1.9.1

'''

Please provide different version of exampleof scripts:
Major current version t
Major version t-1
Major version t-2

Question:  Can you include example scripts as part of regression tests ?
