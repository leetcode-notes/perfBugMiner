TensorArray: Tried to write to index 18 but array is not resizeable and size is: 18

Problem
I wrote an application using TensorArray. It prints out error about allocate memory.
For each sample. It must create a lot of TensorArray to store temporary data.
With few number of samples (around 20), it passed smoothly 100 epochs.
When I trained with the whole dataset (10.000 samples), it have never passed epoch 6. The stopped epochs are varied.
