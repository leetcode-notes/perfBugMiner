Download and setup instructions issue, incorrect version of CuDNN

Instructions indicate to use CuDNN 5 with Tensorflow for GPU with CUDA Tookit 8.0 and Python 3.5 under Ubuntu/Linux. After doing that, when using the Tensorflow Python API I get a run-time error:
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:378] Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 5005 (compatibility version 5000) but source was compiled with 5105 (compatibility version 5100). If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library to match. If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime matches a compatible version specified during compile configuration.
and the computation stops.
If instead I use CuDNN 5.1, the computation goes through correctly.
I have installed Tensorflow 0.12.1 for Python 3.5 with GPU with:
sudo -H pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
under Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.
> python3 -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"

0.12.1

Here a program that can be used to reproduce the issue.
I believe installation instructions should be updated to reference CuDNN 5.1.
