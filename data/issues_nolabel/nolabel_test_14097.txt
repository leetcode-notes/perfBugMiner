how can i get a specific version of tf

platform
raspbian 8.0
problem
I need this specific release of tensorflow... and does anyone have the repository of that version?
it needs to be a source file.. because of some specific situation and some difficulties that hard to solve, I have to compile it from source and get a consequence similar to git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git but in the version of 1.1.0
related:
https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/blob/master/GUIDE.md
after bazel build in this guidance, the contributor gave the command like this:
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.1.0-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl
I don't know whether this command will have some influence.. but an release can adapt to this command will be ideal...
many thx!
