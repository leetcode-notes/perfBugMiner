Feature Request - Return final loss from tf.estimator.Estimator.train along with self.

Describe the problem
Things like hyper opt need to know the loss so that it can effectively pick the best hyper parameters for the model. Right now self is just returned, it is a one line change to the code since the loss is set the exact line before. I would be happy to initiate the PR myself assuming its wanted.
Source code / logs
From:
loss = self._train_model(input_fn=input_fn, hooks=hooks)
logging.info('Loss for final step: %s.', loss)
return self

To:
loss = self._train_model(input_fn=input_fn, hooks=hooks)
logging.info('Loss for final step: %s.', loss)
return self, loss
