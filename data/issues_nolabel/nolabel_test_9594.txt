How can I check the test coverage?

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS 10.12
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): (binary) pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tensorflow (1.1.0)
tensorflow-gpu (1.0.1)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5-homebrew
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.0
GPU model and memory: AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I'm planning to develop some test codes for contribution.
Therefore, I need to find some untested codes using code coverage tools.
I have tried to find the way to check test coverage in this project.
But I couldn't figure that out.
Is there anyone tell me how to check it out?
I'm now running tests like this.
./configure
bazel test //tensorflow/tensorboard/backend:application_test

Sincerely
