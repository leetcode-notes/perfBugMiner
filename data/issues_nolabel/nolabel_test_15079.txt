could softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits's  label  has many 1.

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Mac 10.13.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):pip
TensorFlow version (use command below):v1.3.0-rc1-2456-g7abd587 1.4.0-dev20170922
Python version: 3.6.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

a = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
# b = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  
b = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0])
sess = tf.Session()
print(str(sess.run(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=b, logits=a))))

I think it maybe should throw a warn. Because the softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits's labels should not accept the label which has many 1.
If we should fix it. could you let me try to fix it ?I want to try, thanks.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
