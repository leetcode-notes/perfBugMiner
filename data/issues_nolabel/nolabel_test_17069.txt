tf.cast() can't cast string to number

OS: Win10 64bit
Tensorflow version: 1.5.0
It looks like tf.cast() can't cast string to number,  but the documents doesn't explain it.
I found this problem when I migrated older versions of tensorflow code to a new version.
When I used tf.cast() to cast string to float, I got error "Unimplemented: Cast string to float is not supported".
And when I used tf.string_to_number () instead of tf.cast (), the problem was solved.
