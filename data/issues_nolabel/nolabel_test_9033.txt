Problem anaconda tensorflow Windows : Traceback <most recent call last>:   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

Hi Guys!  [ # if you don't won't to read everything go down directly to # SOLUTION ]
here is the way how i fixed the problem of installing tensorflow on Windows. I will start 👍from the begining 👍


I downloaded the Anaconda 4.3.1 For Windows with Python 3.6 version.


Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:
C:> conda create -n tensorflow


Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:
C:> activate tensorflow
(tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change


Issue the appropriate command to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:


(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
Message appear : can not install this wheel ......... [ i forgot the message, it's just couldn't find the point]
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command (on a single line):
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
same message appear couldn't install
so after that i wanted to write my first code 👍
c>python
python version 3.6 .... (anaconda).............



import tensorflow as tf
[it appears this Error : ]



Traceback :
File "", line 1, in 
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

SOLUTION
Fix The Problem :
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
tensorflow-1.0.1 -cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
tensorflow version 1.0.1
-cp 35 : python version needed
win_amd64 : windows x64
so the Anaconda 4.3.1 For Windows with Python 3.6 version so we need python 3.5 i downloaded it from other this web site cause anaconda has only the version 4.3.1 &  for python 2.7 :
so this anaconda for python 3.5 : http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/get-anaconda
then i followed the other steps & everything worked fine :), i hope everything will work with you
