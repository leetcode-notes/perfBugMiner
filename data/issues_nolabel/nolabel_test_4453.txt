Remove state_ops.variable_op()?

I'm reading the source code, and I find there is a comment saying that
# TODO(mrry): Move this to where it is used, so we can get rid of this op wrapper?
in the state_ops.py
So, I searched and found that only variables.py calls it twice times here, and here.
BTW, some xx_test.py also call it, but I think it's easy to change.
In a word, could I handle the issue and update all the files?@mrry
I output the file list which call the variable_op():
Variables.py
Variables_test.py
Variable_ops_test.py
Tensor_util_test.py
Moving_averages_test.py
Learning_rate_decay_test.py
Graph_util_test.py
Control_flow_ops_py_test.py
