Fix static initialization based registry patterns with shared libraries.

We rely on static initializers of shared libraries of which no other
code is used to be run; thus, the shared libraries need to be linked
into the final binary. Some distributions default to -as-needed for
linking shared libraries into binaries, which discards libraries that
are not actively referenced.
