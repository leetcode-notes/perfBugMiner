Add clang style check as part of the sanity check

This fix is an effort to add clang style check as part of the sanity check.
NOTE: Not sure if this PR is relevant so feel free to close it if it doesn't make sense
In CONTRIBUTING.md it has been advised to run clang-format --style=google file.cc so that Google coding style is conformed. However, there is no sanity check in the current Jenkins build so current .cc and .h files in the repo are not really conforming to the coding style.
This actually causes issues. In case a PR is submitted with clang-format --style=google file.cc, the reviewer may see additional unrelated changes which might be a distraction. The developer may also spent additional time to manually check for any discrepancies manually with additional unrelated style changes.
This fix adds the clang-format check to the ci build so that when ci_sanity.sh is running, it will use clang-format to make sure the code is conforming to the coding style as specified in CONTRIBUTING.md.
One thing that might need to take notice is the header order of the Eigen library. See
#13907 (comment) for further details.
Basically, if Eigen headers could be placed in any order, then no additional steps are needed. Otherwise, it is always possible to place the Eigen headers at the top, then leave one empty line like:
#include "third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor"

#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
...
In this way, even a run of clang-format -i --style=google file.cc will still respect the order and leave Eigen header at the top.
This PR is experimeal so it only checks tensorflow/core/ops directory. Other files could be added if this PR is OK.
This PR also sanitizes all files in tensorflow/core/ops directory so that it conforms to coding style requirement.
