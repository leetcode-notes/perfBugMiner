The window in tf.contrib.rnn.AttentionCellWrapper()

It is very strange to have a fixed-sized window in the implementation of AttentionCellWrapper, because there is no description about it in the Bahdanau paper. Of course, the behave of the window is not clear, which makes me confused. Can anyone explain it?
