Update eigen and gemmlowp dependencies

This PR updates some dependencies which are required to make Tensorflow work on the ARM platform.
The first dependency, Eigen has been updated to version 3.4 containing this fix.
The second one updates Gemmlowp with this fix with the issue reported on this thread .
⚠️ The PR doesn't work as-is simply because I wasn't able to upload the archives to http://mirror.bazel.build. Could someone points me to the right direction on how to do it? Or do it in my place if I don't have the rights to do so? Thank you.
