contrib/makefile: No session factory registered for the given session options

Environment info
Operating System: Arch Linux 64-bit
GCC: 6.1.1
no CUDA or cuDNN used
Tensorflow installed from Git repo sources. I tried v0.9.0 and current master (c129591).
Steps to reproduce
1. Build contrib/makefile (download_dependencies.sh + make)
2. Link produced tensorflow-core to a C++ project
3. Try to create a new TensorFlow session:
Session* session;
Status status = NewSession(SessionOptions(), &session);
4. Compile succeeds, but running the code gives:
E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/session.cc:69] Not found: No session factory registered for the given session options: {target: "" config: } Registered factories are {}.

tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark seems to be working.
