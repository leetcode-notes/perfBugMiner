Integration of "Tensor Comprehensions"?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Not relevant
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Not relevant
TensorFlow version (use command below): Not relevant
Python version: Not relevant
Bazel version (if compiling from source): Not relevant
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Not relevant
CUDA/cuDNN version: Not relevant
GPU model and memory: Not relevant
Exact command to reproduce: Not relevant

Describe the problem
FAIR just released an initial version of their Tensor Comprehension Framework which I think is a really clever concept. The Tensor comprehension library allows to define functions with a syntax similar to einstein-notation and then compiles these functions into fast GPU code via evolutionary search. Is this something you would consider including into the core or would you rather favor an integration as a separate framework?
Cheers,
