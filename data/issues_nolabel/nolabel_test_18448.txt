Replace all COMPILER_MSVC to _MSC_VER and _WIN32 accordingly

-D compile flag should be avoided as much as possible. Many Google projects like Chromium follow  (which uses CMake or GN) only define macro in header file like below and always include the header file to get the macro (IWYU).
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define COMPILER_MSVC
#endif
However, such rule is not easy to implement for Tensorflow as Bazel require strict header dependency. It is easier to just use _MSC_VER and _WIN32 directly.
Other stuff:

Remove ARRAYSIZE macro in tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/port.h (only used in tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc, which is now replaced with TF_ARRAYSIZE from tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/macros.h).
