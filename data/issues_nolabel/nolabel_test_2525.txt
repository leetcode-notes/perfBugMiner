the cudnn lib directory is not in the tensorflow gpu docker image's LD_LIBRARY_PATH

libcudnn4 is installed in the gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu docker image, but I get the following errors from the jupyter tensorflow tutorial:
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:204] could not find cudnnCreate in cudnn DSO; dlerror: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so: undefined symbol: cudnnCreate
running env shows that LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not have a reference to the libcudnn.so location
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64:
