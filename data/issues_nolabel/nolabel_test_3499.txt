Placeholder names are inconsistent when re-entering a scope

with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
        for name in ["a","b"]:
            with tf.variable_scope("fc"):
                x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1], name=name)
                print(x)

gives
Tensor("fc/a:0", shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
Tensor("fc_1/b:0", shape=(1,), dtype=float32)

The variable "b" unexpectedly has the name "fc_1/b:0" rather than "fc/b:0". This makes it difficult to refer to placeholders by name in my program.
