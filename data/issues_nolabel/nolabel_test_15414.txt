Failed to convert a .pb file to a .lite file where there is a custom lite op sin

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4.0
Python version: 2.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.8.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
I followed "How to use custom operators" to create a .pb file and "sin.cc" in //tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernel/. Then I added "TfLiteRegistration* Register_SIN();" and "AddCustom("Sin", Register_SIN());" in "register.cc"
But when I used the bazel command to covert the pb file, the sin op can not be converted
Here is the command I used:
bazel build //tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco:toco
bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/toco --input_file=tftest/sin.pb --input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF --output_file=tftest/sin.tflite --output_format=TFLITE --inference_type=FLOAT --input_array=input --input_shape=1 --output_array=output
Here is the corresponding ERROE information:
Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: Sin.
I tried to use ----allow_custom_ops, but it did not work. Here is the ERROR information:
Converting unsupported operation: Sin
I think I have to modify more files, but I do not know which files I should modify and how to modify. Could you please give a detailed demo?
Thx
