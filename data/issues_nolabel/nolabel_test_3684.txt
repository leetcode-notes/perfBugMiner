ExponentialMovingAverage.variables_to_restore() treats all vars like they have averages

Use:
ema = tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage(0.9)
test = tf.Variable(0.1)
print(ema.variables_to_restore([test])

outputs {u'Variable/ExponentialMovingAverage': <tensorflow.python.ops.variables.Variable object at 0x1139d1bd0>}
I expect variables_to_restore not to append /ExponentialMovingAverage to the names of variables that do not have averages tracked.
I checked that ema._averages and tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES) were indeed both empty.  Calling ema.average_name(test) produces the modified name and this appears to be done specifically (perhaps for another reason).  So variables_to_restore incorrectly modifies the name because it uses average_name.
