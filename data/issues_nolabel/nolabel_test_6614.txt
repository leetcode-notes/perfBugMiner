zlib has disappeared

Obviously this isn't your doing, but http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz and http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz are no longer on that server. The new http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.10.tar.gz released yesterday is there.
Because dependencies are downloaded as needed this is breaking the build.
