Silent fail when network is big

Steps to reproduce

Build a 10 layer hidden network with 2400 neurons in each layer
Have data with correlation
Accuracy will be 1 / n_classes_outputs for each training step.

What have you tried?

If you will have less neurons and layers, everything works

I presume that there is a issue with memory and setting weights, but a error message would be nice.
