Incorrect documentation on log_loss

I noticed that [1] states that tf.contrib.losses.log_loss is deprecated and that tf.losses.log_loss should be used instead. However in v0.12 that function does not exist and the documentation in [2] does not talk about this. So which one is correct?
Furthermore it seems that tf.contrib.losses.log_loss only returns a scalar for the summed loss of all dimensions. Is there a function more like tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (but without the softmax), that returns the loss for each element separately?
