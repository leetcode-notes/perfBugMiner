Tensorboard not displaying event files

Hi all
First time posting, please forgive and correct me if i do anything wrong or stupid.
I have an issue where I am training a model, but tensorboard isn't displaying any data from the event files. I've done everything in my knowledge. Yes I read the tensorboard ReadMe FAQ. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md#frequently-asked-questions
I start the train process with the folowing command (cmd started in folder with the directories "tf_files" and "flower_photos" int it):
python retrain.py --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks --model_dir=tf_files/models/"mobilenet_0.50_224" --summaries_dir=tf_files/training_summaries/"mobilenet_0.50_224" --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt --architecture="mobilenet_0.50_224" --image_dir=flower_photos



The retraining finishes successfully.
Tensorboard i start with the command:
tensorboard --logdir i:/temp/learningtf/tf_files/training_summaries

The command above with --inspect give me the following output:


As you can see, tensorboard doesn't display anything. Im quite confused.

Here are the event files I'm talking about. If these are not the files you need, post a reply and tell my which files i need to upload, please.
the_i_hope_right_files.zip
If you need eny further Info on this case, please let me know.
Thanks for any help in advance.
