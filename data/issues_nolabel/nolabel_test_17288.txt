OutOfRangeError (see above for traceback): box_index has values outside [0, batch_size)

SYSTEM INFO:
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Tensorflow version: 1.4.0
Python version: 2.7.12

My issue is very similar to this one here: issue #10618
I have been doing a multi-GPU session and I get some weird behavior from Tensorflow.
My script only can finish its run in 1 out of 6 attempts, and in each finished execution, the result is slightly different from the single-GPU execution mode (unrepeatable error). If the execution cannot finish, most of the time it reports OutOfRangeError (see above for traceback): box_index has values outside [0, batch_size)
, which is not supposed to appear for tensorflow 1.4 and above, according to the issue above.
Moreover, sometimes it would report InternalError (see above for traceback): Blas SGEMM launch failed : m=14700, n=2048, k=1024
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
