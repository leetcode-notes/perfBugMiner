Validate axis in shape function of tf.reverse

tf.reverse requires the axis to be in the range of [-rank(tensor), rank(tensor)). Previously the validation is only done in runtime though it is possible to validate axis inside the shape function if the shape of the input tensor is already known.
This fix add the validation in the shape function.
