The TensorFlow library was compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these aren't available on your machine.

Hello,
My CPU is AMD Phenom II x6 1090t, I don't know if that's relevant.
I have an issue with my tensorflow, I have tried a few things and nothing is working. Here is the error I'm getting when I run my script.
chad@chad-GA-990XA-UD3:~/tensorflow$ ./configure
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]:
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation [Default is -march=native]:
Do you wish to use jemalloc as the malloc implementation? [Y/n]
jemalloc enabled
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N]
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [y/N]
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with the XLA just-in-time compiler (experimental)? [y/N]

I followed this tutorial generally https://alliseesolutions.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/install-gpu-tensorflow-from-sources-w-ubuntu-16-04-and-cuda-8-0-rc/
Can anyone help me?
