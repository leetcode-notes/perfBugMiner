time to restore saved model increases over time

System information

Manjaro Linux
TensorFlow installed with pip:
TensorFlow version: v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee 1.3.0:
Python version: 3.6.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0.61-3 / 7.0.3-1
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1080 (8 GB)

Describe the problem
Executing the code below in a loop slows down linearly with
number of iteration as can be seen in the figures below.
(The use case being a long running app where different models
are loaded (multiple times) depending on user inputs)
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.25)
config = tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options)

with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(modelname)
    saver.restore(sess, tf.train.latest_checkpoint("./"))
