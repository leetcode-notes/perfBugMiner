error when import skflow from tensorflow.contrib..

I successfully installed tensorflow using ' pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp34-none-linux_x86_64.whl'!!!
Instead when i run the examples in tensorflow/examples/skflow, an error occurred.
' ImportError: cannot import name 'skflow'!
it seems that the error comes from one sentence ' from tensorflow.contrib import skflow'.
I tried to solve this problem, and asked the author(maybe). he said 'you should install 0.8 RC0 (released today) - it has skflow/learn now 0.7.1 didn't have it yet (it was a separate repo when it was released)'.
I really confused about this.
So, how to insert the skflow(from a separate repo) into tensorflow?
