Unable to visualize Inception v3 graph in TensorBoard with TensorFlow 0.7.1

Summary
Attempting to visualize the Inception v3 graph with TensorBoard results in an empty graph (after several minutes of loading).
Update: an earlier version of this issue indicated that the progress bar hung forever, but apparently, I just didn't wait long enough.
Environment info
Operating System: OS X 10.11.3, Chrome 48.0.2564.116, Anaconda 1.2.2
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp35-none-any.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".: 0.7.1

Steps to reproduce

Downloaded and un-tar the inception v3 model. The graph protobuffer is in /tmp/imagenet/classify_image_graph_def.pb.
Run this code to dump the graph:

    import os
    import os.path
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile

    INCEPTION_LOG_DIR = '/tmp/inception_v3_log'

    if not os.path.exists(INCEPTION_LOG_DIR):
        os.makedirs(INCEPTION_LOG_DIR)
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        model_filename = '/tmp/imagenet/classify_image_graph_def.pb'
        with gfile.FastGFile(model_filename, 'rb') as f:
            graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
            graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
            _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
        writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter(INCEPTION_LOG_DIR, graph_def)
        writer.close()

Run tensorboard: tensorboard --logdir /tmp/inception_v3_log
Navigate to graphs tab at http://0.0.0.0:6006/#graphs

Expected result: the graph
Actual result: Empty graph screen (after several minutes of loading with no movement of the progress bar)
A 91 MB file (same size as the graph protobuffer) called events.out.tfevents.1456423256.[hostname] is correctly saved to the log directory, so it seems that the graph is in there somewhere.
What have you tried?

Installing Python 2 pip version of TensorFlow 0.7.1 in a separate conda environment; same results.
Running mnist_summaries_example; graph is shown in TensorBoard properly, so this is a problem with the Inception model
