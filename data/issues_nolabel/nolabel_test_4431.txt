Forward mode ad, directional derivatives

Say I have outputs = f(inputs) and g of the same shape as inputs. I'd like to compute the directional derivative of outputs with respect to inputs in the direction g - in other words, the derivative of f(inputs + alpha * g) with respect to alpha at the point alpha=0.
This is a straightforward application of forward-mode automatic differentiation, which should be pretty easy to implement (much easier than the already-implemented reverse-mode ad). Are there any plans to add this feature?
