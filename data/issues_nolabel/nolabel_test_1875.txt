Gradient for MatrixTriangularSolve

We have a gradient op in master for MatrixSolve . It seems like it shouldn't be too difficult to define a gradient for MatrixTriangularSolve in a similar way. Are there any imminent plans to do this? @rmlarsen @girving ?
I actually had a look at doing it myself but I was getting some strange numerical behaviour from the finite differences test. Possibly just something I am doing wrong. If we can work out what is going on with the test I would be happy to help.
