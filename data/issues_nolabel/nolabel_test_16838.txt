Fixes issue when linking of rule '//tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco:toco' fails because LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not configured. The workaround is to add --action_env="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" to bazel build as described here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47080760/tensorflow-fails-to-compile/47295278#47295278.
