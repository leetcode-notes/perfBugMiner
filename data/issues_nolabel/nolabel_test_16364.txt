Standardizing the saved format and/or converting to big-endian on read

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04 s390x
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.1
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: bazel test -c opt //tensorflow/python:framework_meta_graph_test which invokes meta_graph.import_scoped_meta_graph.

Describe the problem
The testdata for //tensorflow/python:framework_meta_graph_test is not platform independent and causes test to fail on Big Endian systems.
As per discussion in #16003 , correct approach would be standardizing the stored format and/or conversion on load based on endianness. Can someone have a look?
