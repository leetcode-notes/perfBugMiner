`tf.global_variable_initializer` is misspelled as `tf.global_variable_initializers` (extra 's' at end) in release notes

In the release notes for 0.12.0rc0, the note on the renaming of tf.initialize_all_variables to tf.global_variable_initializer has a typo, calling it tf.global_variable_initializers instead. It's a small typo, but I think it's worth fixing since this is such an important breaking change.
