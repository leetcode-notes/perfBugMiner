TFRecord usage

Describe the problem
Can I get meta data of record in TFRecord file using tf queue pipeline, which type is an int or np.ndarry without a Tensor?
So I can use this meta data to tf.shuffle_batch example, and I do not want use a another Sesson to fecth from Tensors.
May this can be a Feature for tf.
