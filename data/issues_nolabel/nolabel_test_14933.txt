Support "causal" padding in tf.keras.layers.Conv1D by adding support to tf.layers.convolutional.Conv1D

TensorFlow version:1.4.0
In the API docs, tf.keras.layers.Conv1D supports "causal". However, if I use "causal" as the argument of 'padding', there will be an error like this: The 'padding' argument must be one of" valid "," same ". Received : causal.
I check the source code, the Conv1D uses the methods in tensorflow.python.layers.convolutional, but the default implementations of tensorflow do not support  "causal" as the padding.
(p.s., fchollet/keras uses the conv1d method in tensorflow_backend.py)
