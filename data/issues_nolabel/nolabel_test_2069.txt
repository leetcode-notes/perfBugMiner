FIFOBucketedQueue

New FIFOBucketedQueue! This queue is similar to the existing FIFOQueue but w/ buckets. This allows you to use the same graph for all your buckets rather than creating multiple graphs for each bucket (i.e., as shown in the TF examples for seq2seq). The main advantage is having a single graph (makes creating a graph much faster and simplier python code). Finally, for those unfamiliar w/ bucketing, see Sutskever et al., 2014 "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks", it is a strategy to sample by say sequence length to reduce the variance of each minibatch, and consequently be much more efficient in computation (at the cost of losing uniform sampling, however this doesn't seem to be a big problem w/ large datasets).
