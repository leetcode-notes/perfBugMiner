How can I know what variables or constants in a ".ckpt" file

How can I know what variables or constants in a ".ckpt" file?
If I restore a ".ckpt" file without defining any variables, I will get error.
However I just want to know what's in that ".ckpt" file.
I didn't see any function can achieve it.
