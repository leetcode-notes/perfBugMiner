Raspberry Pi 3 C++ compiling issue

System information
Raspberry Pi 3 running a clean install of latest Raspbian (version November 2017)
Have I written custom code: No
OS Platform and Distribution : Raspbian (version November 2017)
TensorFlow installed from : git cloned the latest version
TensorFlow version: git cloned the latest version
Bazel version: N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version : N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: Tensorflow Makefile for Raspberry Pi
Problem
I am having a problem building the C++ library of Tensorflow.
First I use a USB as a swap by follwing the instructions here:
https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/blob/master/GUIDE.md#2-install-a-memory-drive-as-swap-for-compiling
Then continued on building tensorflow with the instructions below:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile#raspberry-pi
I followed all the steps and believed that everything went successfull,
until I build the library and example using the command below:
make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI \
 OPTFLAGS="-Os -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -funsafe-math-optimizations -ftree-vectorize" CXX=g++-4.8

Logs
It will ran for quite few hours until it stops and outputs the error below:
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile:730: recipe for target '/home/pi/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark' failed
make: *** [/home/pi/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark] Error 1
