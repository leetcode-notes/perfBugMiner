Tree-LSTM couldn't be trained on the GPU

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04;macOS10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):pip
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.6.0
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: V9.0.176
GPU model and memory: Titan XP, 12G
Exact command to reproduce: GPU: python main.py;
CPU: running main.py on the Pycharm

Describe the problem
Optimization function could not be used. Because once using the optimization, the process will be stuck. When I don't use the optimization, the process can be continued.
based on strace -p, process stucks on futex_wait_private
