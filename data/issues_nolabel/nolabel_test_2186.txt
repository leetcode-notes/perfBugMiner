TensorBoard build failure on Jenkins

TensorBoard build has failed for quite a while in Jenkins now. The failure seems to have to do with gulp config, for example:

[16:46:28] Using gulpfile /workspace/tensorflow/tensorboard/gulpfile.js
[16:46:28] Task 'compile.all' is not in your gulpfile
[16:46:28] Please check the documentation for proper gulpfile formatting

For full build log, see example: http://ci.tensorflow.org/job/tensorflow-master-tensorboard/161/console
