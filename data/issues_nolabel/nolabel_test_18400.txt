Using boosted trees without an estimator

Have I written custom code : NO
OS Platform and Distribution : CentOS
TensorFlow installed from : Sources
TensorFlow version : r1.8
Bazel version : 0.11
CUDA/cuDNN version : 9.1/7.0
GPU model and memory : GTX 1080 Ti
Exact command to reproduce : N/A
At the moment is it  possible to use the TensorFlow implementation of boosted trees without invoking the concept of an Estimator ?
Examples , demonstrate its usage using estimator.
Can it be used as just another node in a TensorFlow graph ?
