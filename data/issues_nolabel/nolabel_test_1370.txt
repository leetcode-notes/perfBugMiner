MultiRNNCell with different cell sizes

When I try to create a MultiRNNCell with different number of units in the recurrent cells (e.g. 5-layer RNN with 32-64-32 GRUCells in the hidden layers) I got the following error:
ValueError: In MultiRNNCell, the input size of each next cell must match the output size of the previous one. Mismatched output size in cell 0.
Is it currently possible to create a MultiRNNCell with different number of hidden units?
