Tensorflow on Ubuntu 14 with cuda 8 and cudnn 5.1

Hello I am trying to install tensorflow on ubuntu 14 with cuda 8 and cudnn 5.1. I followed the instructions here  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#installing-from-sources
I was able to run the demo model but when I try to import tensorflow in python I get the following error



import tensorflow
