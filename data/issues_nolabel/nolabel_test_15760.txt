Custom gradient aggregation methods

I would like a way to apply some custom gradient aggregation ops. Probably the simplest thing to do is just allow tf.gradients (and Optimizer.compute_gradients) to return un-aggregated gradients so I could work with those?
Anyway, seems like an easy fix? I will do this myself in a month or so (cant now as on holiday), but if someone else wants to do it/has some thoughts, I am interested.
