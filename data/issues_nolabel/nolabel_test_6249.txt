InvalidArgumentError: Input to reshape is a tensor with 313600 values, but the requested shape requires a multiple of 4608

When I implemented this (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) by TensorFlow, I had an issue on reshaping. When I tried to flatten 12 * 12 * 32 tensor, I had an error message saying
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Input to reshape is a tensor with 313600 values, but the requested shape requires a multiple of 4608 [[Node: Reshape_1 = Reshape[T=DT_FLOAT, Tshape=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](dropout/mul, Reshape_1/shape)]]
I tried to match the input shape, but the error message said "a tensor with 313600 values" which I had no idea where this came from. Therefore, I thought this might be an issue on TensorFlow.
