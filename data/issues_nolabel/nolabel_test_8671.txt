regarding best approach to update tensorflow without affecting other installed packages

We have maintained a virtual environment to hold all the deep learning-related development projects. In this environment, we have installed tensorflow, keras, theano and quite a lot otherpython libraries for project purposes.
Currently, I would like to update tensorflowfrom 0.12.0-rc0 to 1.0. To keep the current development environment, which is shared by other users, I donâ€™t want to change the current virtual environment at all.
I am thinking of the following options,


Create another virtual environment, have tensorflowwith the latest version of 1.0


Are there any ways to just copy or link all the other python packages in the old environment to the new virtual environment? I just do not want to re-install everything.


Thank you for the advice!
