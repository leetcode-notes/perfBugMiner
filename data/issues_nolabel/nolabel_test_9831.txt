gpu_memory_fraction for tf.contrib.lean Estimators stopped working in tensorflow 1.1.0

I was updating to Tensorflow 1.1.0 to use the tf.estimator API and I found, that I couldn't get it to use less than the full GPU RAM for one process.
I was trying to find out where the issue is and found, that also the tf.contrib.lean.Estimators had the same problem.
Here a code snippet to reproduce the issue:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.contrib.learn import DNNClassifier
import os

tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO)

from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets('MNIST_data', one_hot=True)

feature_columns = [tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column("x", dimension=mnist.train.images.shape[1])]
model = DNNClassifier(hidden_units=[10,10],
                      feature_columns=feature_columns,
                      n_classes=10,
                      config=tf.contrib.learn.RunConfig(gpu_memory_fraction=0.1))

input_fn_train = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn(
                                x={"x":mnist.train.images.reshape([-1,28,28,1]).astype(np.float32)[:1000]},
                                y=np.argmax(mnist.train.labels[:1000],1).astype(np.int32),
                                batch_size=50,
                                num_epochs=50,
                                )


model.fit(input_fn=input_fn_train)


With tensorflow 1.0.1 it works as expected and only allocated 1/10 of the GPU RAM, but in tensorflow 1.1.0 it ignores this parameter.
I also check with the code from the MNIST for ML beginners code  and used the GPUOptions when initializing the session:
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.1)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))

It works as expected in both verions.
Somehow this GPU options is not set correctly when using the tf.contib.learn.Estimator framework OR The gpu_memory is allocated before this call.
I asked this before on the tensorflow discuss group and I was told that is is a bug.
