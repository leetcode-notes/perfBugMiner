document error

I was following the getting started tutorial and found one issue in this http://tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage.md#overview.
there is undefined name "state" in the example of Variables section. I think it should be "var" but I am new to tensorflow. Please confirm and update the doc so that others don't get confused.
