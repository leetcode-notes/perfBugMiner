Adding mechanism for XLA device plugins to be loaded into the python unit tests

By copying and configuring 2 files, the unit test framework will include a plugin when running.

tensorflow/compiler/tests/plugin_config.tpl -> tensorflow/compiler/tests/plugin_config.py

This file should contain the registered name of the device, the types that it supports, and the name of a python module that loads the plugin.

tensorflow/compiler/tests/plugin/BUILD.tpl -> tensorflow/compiler/tests/plugin/BUILD

This should contain a rule called 'deps' that contains attributes for ensuring that the plugin and its associated files are included in the runfiles of the unit tests. A 'data' attribute is probably most appropriate.
