connect trained inception model to classify_image.py file cannot find pbtxt file

I have tried the training on flowers, it generated 2 files in /tmp a output_graph.pb and output_labels.txt file, but when i tried connecting these files to classify_image.py file I found the code is reading a .pbtxt apart from .pb and .txt file. How do I use the python code without the pbtxt file.
find the classify_image code here
