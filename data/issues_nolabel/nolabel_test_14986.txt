improvement in the tf.nn.raw_rnn documentation

PR for #14963. This exposes the advanced use-case of the raw_rnn where the user can project the cell_output into logits as a part of the loop_fn computations. Earlier it mislead the users that it is mandatory for the loop_fn to return emit_output such that it matches the cell.output_size.
