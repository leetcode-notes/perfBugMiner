What will dynamic_rnn reuse when set reuse of variable_scope as true

I'm sorry but I havn't found a clear answer in StackOverflow
I wonder what will dynamic_rnn reuse when set reuse of variable_scope as true, only the gate parameters will be share or including the output & status?
The example is that my code wanna process two sequence with different length by one bidirectional LSTM network, and then compare them for further use. Will I set reuse as True when process the second sequence at one step? Do I need to clear the state in this situation?
