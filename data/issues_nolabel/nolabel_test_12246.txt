make `gather` cpu kernel to be multiple threads.

related to 11709.
On a single machine, profiling the embedding_lookup_sparse with tfprof, the result shows that gather Op takes a lot of time. I checked the code and found that the CPU version gather op is single-thread.
Then I modify the gather Op to multi-threads, the result shows about 6x speedup.
