Tensorflow Debugger crashes on tab complete

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary (pip wheel)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version:  3.5
GPU model and memory: (CPU only)

Describe the problem
Sometimes when using tfdbg, tab-completing on pt will crash the debugger (unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to reproduce this consistently yet) and my terminal will look like:

the terminal will be unresponsive, and scrolling + regular mouse selection will be disabled (although SHIFT + mouse selection will work).

As I said, I unfortunately have not figured out how to reproduce this regularly -- this happens every once in a while when I'm working on the LSTM from #12465. I'll try to create a minimal reproducible test case later, but I figured I'd file this ticket first.
