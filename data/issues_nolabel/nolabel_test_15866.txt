TensorFlow fails to build with MPI

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS 7.4
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): r1.5
Python version: 2.7.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.9.0 & 0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 6.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build --copt -mfma --copt -mavx2 --copt -O3 --verbose_failures -s -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
TensorFlow fails to build with MPI with the following error:

This error persists even when Bazel 0.7.0 is used to build TensorFlow.
