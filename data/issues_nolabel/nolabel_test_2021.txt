bazel not respecting PYTHONPATH

Environment info
Operating System: Fedora 23
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
Built without GPU
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
c303ff7
Steps to reproduce

bazel --output_base=/projects/.cache test //tensorflow/...

What have you tried?

starting python from command line and import tensorflow is ok.
the above command line produces tests shown below in the pastebin in the log section
echo $PYTHONPATH
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages:/projects/.cache/tensorflow/bazel-out/local_linux-fastbuild/bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles
I think there is an imports function recently added for bazel, would like some pointers to see if this is the best way to solve this problem and change all the bazel files (and not commit them to pull requests), or if there are better ways.
