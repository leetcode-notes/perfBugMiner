interpreter crashes with SIGSEGV (tf 0.7.0-cpu, python 3.5)

I pip-installed the 0.7.0-cpu (linux) release on a python 3.5 conda environment, and now get the following error:
Python 3.5.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:16:01) 
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
fish: “python” terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)

I also installed the 2.7 version in a separate conda environment, and everything works fine.  Both environments are up-to-date (conda upgrade --all).  Any ideas?
