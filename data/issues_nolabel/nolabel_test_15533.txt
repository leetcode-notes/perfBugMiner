added note about weights gradient in compute_weighted_loss

Added a note concerning the gradient computation w.r.t. weights in losses.compute_weighted_loss,
see #15046.
I have only added it to this function, and not the other losses (like mean_squared_error) because it is a rare cornercase that should be documented somewhere, but is of no relevance to most users.
