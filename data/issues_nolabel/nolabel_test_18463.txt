Op type not registered 'GatherV2' error when using libtensorflow maven artifacts

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): maven
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0-rc1
Java version: 1.8.0_162
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80

Describe the problem
When attempting to use the libtensorflow maven artifacts mentioned in the GPU Support for Java page to load an exported graph, I received the error:
Exception in thread "main" org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'GatherV2'
	at org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle.load(Native Method)
	at org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle.load(SavedModelBundle.java:39)
	at net.imagej.ops.experiments.filter.deconvolve.FlowdecGraph.load(FlowdecGraph.java:38)

Please let me know if any other information would help, but the error seems pretty informative so I just wanted to check and see if support for newer operations like "GatherV2" were likely to make it into the java artifacts in the near future.
It may also help to note that the same code I was running works just fine when using either python or the non-gpu-enabled java artifact like this:
<dependency>
         <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
         <artifactId>tensorflow</artifactId>
         <version>1.7.0-rc1</version>
</dependency>

But switching that to these dependencies results in the error (with no other changes):
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
	<artifactId>libtensorflow</artifactId>
	<version>1.7.0-rc1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
	<artifactId>libtensorflow_jni_gpu</artifactId>
	<version>1.7.0-rc1</version>
</dependency>

Thanks for the help!
