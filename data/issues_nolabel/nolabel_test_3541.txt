Constant folding seems to cause error with ImmutableConst ops

Using memory-mapped ImmutableConst ops seems to cause the initial constant folding process to fail.
Reproduction steps:

Load a graph containing ImmutableConst ops.
Create a memory-mapped environment and session like this:

 // Create and initialize MemmappedEnv from the converted file.
  MemmappedEnv memmapped_env(Env::Default());
  TF_ASSERT_OK(memmapped_env.InitializeFromFile(filename_mmap));

  // Load the graph and run calculations.
  SessionOptions session_options;
  session_options.env = &memmapped_env;
  std::unique_ptr<Session> session(NewSession(session_options));

Run the graph using session->Run().

Expected results:
The graph should execute successfully with no error messages.
Actual results:
The graph seems to execute correctly, but the following is printed to the console:
E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:334] Executor failed to create kernel. Unimplemented: File system scheme memmapped_package not implemented
     [[Node: W_conv23 = ImmutableConst[dtype=DT_FLOAT, memory_region_name="memmapped_package://W_conv23", shape=[9,9,32,3], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]()]]

Notes
From investigation, it seems like the constant folding code creates a new device with empty session options, which means a default Env is used instead of the memory-map-aware one the client passes in:
