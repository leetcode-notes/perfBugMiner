Changing the number of (CPU) threads for cifar10

Whenever I run the cifar10_eval.py, in creates 32 threads as following:
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:25] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 32
I think this number of threads is the number of threads running on CPUs, but when I check the usage, only 400-500% of CPUs are used. I wonder if there is anyway to change this number of threads?
Thanks
