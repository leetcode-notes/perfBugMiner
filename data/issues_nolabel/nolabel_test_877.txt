word2vec.py error

I download the tensorflow-master version.
When I execute the word2vec.py on pycharm, it shows the error:
from tensorflow.models.embedding import gen_word2vec as word2vec
ImportError: No module named embedding
In init.py, I see "Import generated word2vec optimized ops into embedding package."
Does it means it needs a file about "generated word2vec optimized ops"? But I can' t find it. How can I fix it?
The environment is Mac OS X, and I install tensorflow in this way: $ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl.
