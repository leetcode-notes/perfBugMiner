No builds for Linux Py3.6-gpu TF1.3 RC2?

Using Python 3.6 in Anaconda on Ubuntu 16.04
source activate py36env 
pip install --upgrade \
> https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
tensorflow_gpu-1.3.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform. 

I checked the build stream and don't see a Linux PY3.6 GPU being built?
Seems to me that since I have TF 1.2 installed (it had the PY3.6GPU support that new RC's should also include builds for Py3.6/GPU or a lot of people just won't build a separt downgraded test environment for the RC?
Or is the intention to drop support?? (I hope not!)
