What is All_op in tf.nn.dynamic_rnn?

Hi, I am doing an android demo for RNN. I built a two-layer GRU network for inference. I used the API tf.nn.dynamic_rnn. However, when using this API, the saved generated .pb file contains an op called "All". And after I moved my .pb file to assets directory and run my android app demo, it said the op "All" is not registered. I know I can register an op in /core/kernels/BUILD file. However, I didn't find such an op in BUILD file. What is it and how can I fix the problem?
Thank you very much!
Here is the .pb file:
node {
name: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/All"
op: "All"
input: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/Equal"
input: "Test/Model/RNN/RNN/Const"
attr {
key: "Tidx"
value {
type: DT_INT32
}
}
attr {
key: "keep_dims"
value {
b: false
}
}
}
