About if tensorflow can use flask to mount in IIS, use like as an web API to use?

I set up a tensorflow system, use flask grammar to set up . And in local computer, all run ok, no error.
But when I mount it in IIS, as Web API to use, It always show FASTCGI error. Does tensorflow  incompatiable with IIS?
