Refer users to the RedBaron fork of this script.

@machrisaa, has created a fork of tf_upgrade.py that uses RedBaron. For minimal dependency reasons, testing reasons and RedBaron's not full Python3 support, we aren't changing the officially supported version yet. In the mean time, we will refer users README.md that they can try it if our script finds a case it cannot handle.
