Describe the problem
Session.run() hangs in thread if it has executed something in the main thread. If we don't execute the first calculate_something() in the main thread- or execute it after we submitted to the pool, everything works. Only when first calculating something in the main thread, and then in the child thread does tensorflow hang.
Reproducing example
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor as ProcessPool


def calculate_something():
    import tensorflow as tf

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        a = tf.constant(2)
        b = tf.constant(3)

        print("a=2, b=3")
        print("Addition with constants: %i" % sess.run(a+b))
        print("Multiplication with constants: %i" % sess.run(a*b))

calculate_something()

pool = ProcessPool(1)
pool.submit(calculate_something)
