Problem with CuDNN RNNs on Windows

OS: Windows10
Keras version: master (as of today: 2.08+)
Tensorflow backend version: master (as of today ~1.4rc0)
GPU: Geforce GTX 1080Ti (11GB)
Cuda version: v8.0
cuDNN version: cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v6.0
First opened as a Keras GitHub issue here (includes full code and error output):
fchollet/keras#8135
Francois Chollet suggested that this may be a Windows TF problem.
Hi, I tried keras.layers.CuDNNLSTM after seeing fchollet's tweet the other day. I have the latest Keras and Tensorflow, but there is a tensorflow problem with the Op 'CudnnRNN' not being registered.
Have I missed something?
Thanks
