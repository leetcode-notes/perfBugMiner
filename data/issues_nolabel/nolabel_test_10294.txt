remove some invalid entries

I noticed that some entries don't exist (anymore).
This seems to be some kind of a consistency issue.
More specifically:
tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/camera/data
tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/testdata/saved_model_half_plus_two
tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/testdata/saved_model_half_plus_two/variables
This is the continuation of PR #10264 @drpngx
