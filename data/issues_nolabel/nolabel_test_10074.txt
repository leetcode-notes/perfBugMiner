fatal problem with saving variables

I coded a simple feedforward neural network and it works very well.
I tried to save the computation time, and created:
self.total_time = tf.Variable(0, dtype = tf.float32, trainable = True, name = 'total_time')
in the fnn class.
and i tried to print the total training time per some training epoch.
I made it to grow with time:
# Check & Print training time
till_now = time.time() - start_time
self.total_time += till_now
print_time(self.total_time.eval())
and the result look something like this :
Epoch :   0 | Evaluation :  115 | Learning Rate : 0.50
Training Loss :         0.040919
Validation Loss :      0.0741969
Validation Accuracy :      97.77%
Total time cost : 0.38 seconds
Epoch :   1 | Evaluation :  116 | Learning Rate : 0.50
Training Loss :        0.0417941
Validation Loss :       0.073841
Validation Accuracy :      97.73%
Total time cost : 0.71 seconds
Epoch :   2 | Evaluation :  117 | Learning Rate : 0.50
Training Loss :        0.0334573
Validation Loss :      0.0745566
Validation Accuracy :      97.75%
Total time cost : 1.01 seconds
However, When i interrupt the training procedure and try to restore global variables and restart the training, I just lose the value of variable total_time and it initialized as 0 which is the value i first give to.
I also checked tf.global_variables() include self.total_time.
What is wrong?
