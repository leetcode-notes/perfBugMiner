Tensorflow installation from local drive

Hi,
I am trying to install Tensorflow in windows machine using docker. It's a corporate connection and I am not able to connect to daemon for installation. If there any way where I can download tensorflow in my local drive and execute it from docker?
$ docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow.tensorflow
Unable to find image 'b.gcr.io/tensorflow.tensorflow:latest' locally
Error response from daemon: unable to ping registry endpoint https://b.gcr.io/v0/
v2 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://b.gcr.io/v2/: dial tcp 74.125.68.
82:443: connection refused
Please help.
