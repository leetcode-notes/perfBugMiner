tensorflow object detection issue

i developed the custom object detector with some 96 images (train 76 and test 20) after trained 200k steps my losses(1) goes down correctly....after that i create the interference graph all ok..........but my question is when i run my code to detect the object from video it not able to find the correct object ........ thanks in advance.....
actually i think we have a enough image for the dataset...because my dataset can able to detect the object from pre built video....so....it can detect the object from webcam also but not ...i dont kw the exact problem.....i think the resolution may b differ...thats y it not able to detect the object....ï»¿

ubuntu 16.04
