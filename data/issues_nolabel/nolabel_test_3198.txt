Error: Nodes were connected by a reference connection

I am running distributed TF 0.8 for Py 3.5. I have followed the initialization of tf.train.Server() as in the imagenet_distributed_train.py. I am getting the following error while executing sv.prepare_or_wait_for_session(). I am passing remote ps server and local workers as the arguments. I do have blocks of code using tf.device('/cpu:0') at some places.
sv = tf.train.Supervisor(is_chief=is_chief,
init_op=init_op,
summary_op=None,
global_step=global_step)
sess_config = tf.ConfigProto(
allow_soft_placement=True,
log_device_placement=True)
Get a session.
sess = sv.prepare_or_wait_for_session(target, config=sess_config)
Error while executing last line:
tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow.StatusNotOK: Invalid argument: Nodes were connected by a reference connection (requiring them to be on the same device), but the two nodes were assigned two different devices: Cannot colocate nodes 'Variable' and 'Assign: Cannot merge devices with incompatible jobs: '/job:ps/task:0' and '/job:worker/task:0'
[[Node: Assign = Assign[T=DT_FLOAT, use_locking=false, validate_shape=true, _device="/job:worker/task:0"](Variable, mul)]]
Any idea what is happening?
