How does conv2d_transpose exactly space out inputs in tensorflow?

This may not be the best place to ask this question but I don't get any help from stackoverflow. Sorry if I ask this question in the wrong place.
I understand how transpose convolution works dealing with 2-D images. I just wonder how conv2d_transpose() function in tensorflow exactly adds zeros to the inputs.
Does it only pad zeros along the border, or does it insert zeros to space out inputs in a certain way?
