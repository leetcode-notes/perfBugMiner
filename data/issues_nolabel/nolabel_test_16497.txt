SpatialConvolution in tflite is very slow

Hi, i build tflite ,using bazel build --cxxopt='--std=c++11' //tensorflow/contrib/lite/java:tensorflowlite
--crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool 
--host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain 
--cpu=armeabi-v7a
I test my CNN model, but it's very slow in google piexl. I analyze time cost of my CNN model. SpatialConvolution function is very slow, only 20%  of the peak flops of my hardware.
my model's data type is kTfLiteFloat32.
Is build script for android right ï¼ŸI doubt my build script is wrong , so run the SpatialConvolution function with ARM NEON.  (I don't know how Eigen is organized in tflite, i can't add log code in the source code to prove my suspicion)
