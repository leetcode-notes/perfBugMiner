Compatibility with Bazel 0.8

Starting from Bazel 0.8 support for set constructors will be removed completely. Currently one of the dependencies, grpc, is not compatible with this: tensorflow uses an old version of it. grpc has already been fixed, please update your dependencies to use grpc with the following commit included: grpc/grpc@759c702
grpc is loaded as a patched_http_archive, you can also update the file third_party/grpc/grpc.patch to include the one-line patch from the commit above if it's more convenient.
Just updating grpc to head or to to the commit that has the fix is not trivial because third_party/grpc/grpc.patch then has to be updated as well. and as I don't know why those changes were necessary I don't know if I should keep, update or delete them when I update grpc.
