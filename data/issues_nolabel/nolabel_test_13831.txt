Fix casting to `size_t` for mkl conv filter dims

Here's the output from clang regarding explicit casting int64 to size_t.
tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl_conv_ops.cc:291:31: error: non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'int64' (aka 'long long') to 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]

After modifying those lines I was able to compile successfully for CPU w/MKL + XLA.
