Pruning some features

I'm doing some work about pruning VGG16. And my method is set some kernel to be zero.
kernel = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([3, 3, 3, 64], dtype=tf.float32,
stddev=1e-1), name='weights')
kernel1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3, 3, 3, 64], dtype=tf.float32), name='pruning_weights',
trainable=False)
kernel1 = kernel1[:, :, :, 0:32].assign(kernel[:, :, :, 0:32])
But I want to train VGG again. the problem said that,
LookupError: No gradient defined for operation 'conv1/conv1_1/conv1/conv1_1/strided_slice/_assign' (op type: StridedSliceAssign)
Anybody came across such issues? Or have some idea to set the kernel last dim to be zero?
Thanks a lot!
