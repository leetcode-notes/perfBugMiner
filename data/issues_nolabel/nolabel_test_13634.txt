Failed build tensorflow with bazel, failed with: error SQLite will not work correctly with the -ffast-math option of GCC.

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): commit: 1ad5e69 master branch
Python version: Python 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source):  0.6.1
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
#build tensorflow
bazel build --config=mkl --copt="-g" --copt="-DEIGEN_USE_VML" --copt="-mavx2" --copt="-mfma" --copt="-O3" --verbose_failures  --copt="-Ofast" --copt="-L/opt/intel/gcc/lib64" -s -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
