Device string in eager API differs from main ops API

In the Python API device strings are normalized such that /cpu:0 becomes /device:CPU:0. This happens in the device.py and more specifically, here. However, the eager execution API throws an error if provided /device:CPU:0 for the device. It only works if I set it to CPU:0. Why does that inconsistency exist? @asimshankar @alextp
P.S. I try to tag people that I believe are relevant based on previous issues/discussions. Please let me know if that's annoying and would prefer me not tagging anyone. :)
