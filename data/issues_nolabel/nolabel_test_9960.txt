Placeholder modification behavior

I am using Tensorflow 1.0.1, on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4, with CPU in a jupyter notebook (but the behavior I am describing appeared in a regular python script too).
The problem I am having is with placeholders. I have been using tensorflow for only 1 month so I was not really comfortable with using them and I made a mistake that took me a very long time to debug.
Here is the type of code I wrote:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
x_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float64, [5])
x_ = tf.where(tf.is_nan(x_), tf.zeros_like(x_), x_)
a = tf.constant(1, shape=[5])
a = tf.cast(a, tf.float64)
c = a + x_
init_op = tf.group(
    tf.global_variables_initializer(),
    tf.local_variables_initializer())
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init_op)
x = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
x[3] = np.nan
sess.run(c, feed_dict={x_: x})
To this, the output was: array([ 1., 2., 3., nan, 5.]), which is not what I expected since I had replaced all the nan with the tf.where. I understood only later that it was because tensorflow was feeding the placeholder in the latest position it appeared (maybe not exactly how it's implemented, but empirically, that is what happens).
Therefore a good (in the sense of what I intended to do) code is:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
x_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float64, [5])
r = x_
r = tf.where(tf.is_nan(r), tf.zeros_like(r), r)
a = tf.constant(1, shape=[5])
a = tf.cast(a, tf.float64)
c = a + r
init_op = tf.group(
    tf.global_variables_initializer(),
    tf.local_variables_initializer())
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init_op)
x = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
x[3] = np.nan
sess.run(c, feed_dict={x_: x})
This indeed outputs array([ 1., 2., 3., 1., 5.]). However, to me it's a bit weird that you would need to throw in an extra variable to achieve this purpose and even weirder that I didn't receive any error when modifying my placeholder.
My suggestions are:

Throw an error or a warning when reallocating a placeholder.
State clearly that placeholders are not meant to be modified (I looked for it in the docs and didn't find it, maybe I didn't look well enough).
Allow placeholders to be modified (might be offputting for someone who understands it well).
