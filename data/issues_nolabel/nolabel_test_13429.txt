Describe the problem
This is a tiny code that creates layers and connects them in series.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.layers.base import Layer


class A(Layer):
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.v = self.add_variable('v', (), tf.float32)
        self.built = True
    
    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.v * inputs
    

# Case 1
with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (), 'x')
   
    out = x
    out = A()(out)
    out = A()(out)
    out = A()(out)
    
    tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard/1', graph=graph).close()

# Case 2
with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (), 'x')
   
    out = x
    out = A(name='a')(out)
    out = A(name='a_1')(out)
    out = A(name='a_2')(out)
    
    tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard/2', graph=graph).close()

# Case 3
with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (), 'x')
   
    out = x
    out = A(name='a_1')(out)
    out = A(name='a_2')(out)
    out = A(name='a_3')(out)
    
    tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard/3', graph=graph).close()
Results
Other than case 3, an unexpected graph is generated.
Is this a bug?

Case 1



Case 2
