TensorFlow logging configuration is non-standard

Describe the problem
The logging configuration in tf_logging is odd and inconsistent with how things are generally done in Python.
In general, it's typical to attach handlers to the root logger in Python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate
However, because tf_logging sets up its own stream handler, and does not disable the propagate flag, anybody who does follow the standard Python convention of attaching handlers to the root logger gets duplicated log output from TensorFlow.
Per #8023, while this isn't a bug per se, it's still wrong and undesirable.
The cleanest way forward is probably to just set propagate=False on the TF logger.
