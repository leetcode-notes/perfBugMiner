Fix problem with camera on Android TV

For a scenario of using a usb external camera, we should use Camera API 2 according to the definition:
Camera1 API is framework API that had been created to support HALv1.x
Camera2 API is a new API that is meant for HALv3.x.
However, CameraCharacteristics.INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_FULL) should return false as USB camera doesn' support all the necessary capabilities.
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_FULL
This is a work around to use facing == CameraCharacteristics.LENS_FACING_EXTERNAL to detect usb external camera and use Camera2 API instead.
