[done] update zeros_initializer()

I'm reading source code this day, and I find there is a #TODO in array_ops.py saying that move zeros_initializer() to init_ops.py.
So, I think I can help update the change. Not only move zeros_initializer() to init_ops.py, but also update the reference files which call array_ops.zeros_initializer().
BTW,  I list all of them as below:

init_ops.py
array_ops.py
rnn_cell.py

3 files in contrib/..

feature_column.py
histogram_ops.py
rnn_cell.py

@girving  Could you have a look?
