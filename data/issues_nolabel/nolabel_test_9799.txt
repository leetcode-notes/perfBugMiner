TensorBoard "gulp" assigns to const

The TensorBoard build is all kinds of broken, but the latest introduction to the tree includes an assignment to a const within the gulpfile.
In particular:
tensorflow/tensorboard/gulp_tasks/compiler.js:51 reassigns to the variable "entries" which is marked with const.
The same occurs on the next line for the variable "deps".
