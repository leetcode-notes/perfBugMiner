Resource exhausted error for translate.py  Seq2seq model (CPU)

Windows 10
Tensorflow: 1.0.0
Python version : 3.5
I get the following error when i try to run translate.py for Seq2seq model
Resource exhausted: OOM when allocating tensor with shape[576,1024]
Is there any way i could reduce the size in translate.py so that the error does not occur?
Thanks
