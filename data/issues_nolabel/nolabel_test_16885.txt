Implementation of the unpooling layer in tf.contrib.layers

This pull request follow the propositions from #2169
And try to reproduce the layer implemented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04366
I integrated the code as a layer in tf.contrib.layers
There is most probably additional changes that are needed.
I saw that there should be a testing unit added but I don't know exactly how it should be done.
