Seq2Seq Documentation is Broken

A good third of the documentation on https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.seq2seq is written about a DynamicAttentionWrapper class.
The link posted for an API results in a 404: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/DynamicAttentionWrapper
This class is not mentioned in __init__.py at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/__init__.py
Can someone please either update the documentation or add the class to git so we can actually use it?
