Diagnostic / assessment tools for network

It would be convenient to have some tools out of the box for assessing networks complexity, computational cost, resources use etc without need for the user to do it 'by hand'. Do you think the following would be possible to implement in a general way?

getting a command to know how many parameters will be optimized by a tf.train node, and how many floating operations are required
more generally, getting a command to know how many operations are required to execute a node with sess.run
getting a set of commands to evaluate memory, cuda cores and bandwith use (both absolute value and proportion of the device) by a node on gpu, and cpu use. A little bit as mentioned here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34629613/how-to-profile-tensorflow-networks
