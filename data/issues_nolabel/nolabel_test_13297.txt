Feature request for graph visualizer: turn off node collapsing

There's a simple feed-forward pbtxt here
It can be visualized without any edges crossing. However latest TensorBoard collapses Relu-Relu_6 nodes together, so that complicates the diagram and introduces edge crossings. It would be nice to have a way to visualize without node collapsing
