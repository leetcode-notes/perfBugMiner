…l(R) MKL
This is an Ubuntu 16.04 Container running Tensorflow 1.4 with Intel MKL.
To test on a system with Docker installed, do this as root:
Build the container (Needs to be done only once; takes about 20 minutes)
# cd <tensorflow-root>tensorflow/tools/docker
# docker build . -t intelaipg/tensorflow -f Dockerfile.devel-cpu-mkl

Then run the container as root. :
# docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/root,target=/host intelaipg/tensorflow
This will bind a directory in the container at /host to /root on the host machine.
Run your tests and benchmarks.
