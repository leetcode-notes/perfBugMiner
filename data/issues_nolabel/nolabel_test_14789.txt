Add templated functions for `safe_strto[f|d|i32|i64|u32|u64]`

While working on #14330 I noticed that there is no templated functions for safe_strto[f|d|i32|i64|u32|u64]. As a result, an additional wrapper has to be created in different places to apply the typename in a templated class or function.
Examples of the wrappers include the existing implementations in tensorflow/core/kernels/string_to_number_op.cc (Convert), tensorflow/core/lib/strings/proto_text_util.h (ProtoParseNumeric), and in #14330.
It might make sense to add a templated function for safe_strto[f|d|i32|i64|u32|u64] to avoid existing and future code duplications.
This fix adds
template<typename T>
bool SafeStringToNumeric(StringPiece s, T* value);

to address the above mentioned issue.
Note: If this PR is merged then #14330 will needs to be updated accordingly.
