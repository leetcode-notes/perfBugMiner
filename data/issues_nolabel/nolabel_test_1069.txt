Use external repository rather than git submodule for protobuf dependency

Currently, TensorFlow vendors its protobuf dependency using a Git submodule due to the hack that is required for protobuf Python support.
I have made a change (bazelbuild/bazel#702) to add an imports attribute to Bazel's Python rules, which allows us to add directories to the PYTHONPATH and thus allows us to remove the hack in protobuf.
I have a patch to remove the hack for protobuf Python support (see google/protobuf#1230). I am testing this change using a corresponding change to TensorFlow which removes the git submodule and includes the protobuf dependency using a Bazel external repository instead. Once my patch for google/protobuf#1230 has been submitted, I will send out my corresponding patch to TensorFlow for review.
