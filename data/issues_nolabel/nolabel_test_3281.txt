Enable reverse op for complex values

I've enabled complex values for the reverse op based on #3271.
This is part of the more general #2577.
I've also extended the tests to cover all enabled dtypes.
One thing that I've noticed is that we're compiling GPU code for bool and int32, but we're not enabling GPU kernels for these dtypes.
I've added commented out versions of the kernel registrations for these dtypes to point out that they're currently not enabled.
