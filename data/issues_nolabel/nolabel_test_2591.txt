TensorFlow "Development" Build Issue

I just built Tensorflow from the most recent source (81db154), and attempted to set it up for a "development" install - using python setup.py develop after following the instructions in the documentation. After doing this, running import tensorflow in Python results in a "package not found" error.
I have found that changing the line in the documentation
ln -s ../bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/org_tensorflow* .

to
ln -s ../bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/org_tensorflow/* .

solves the problem (the difference is an extra backtick near the end of the line). Perhaps this was a typo?
