run image_retraining always get  ‘integer division or modulo by zero’

I tried bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain && \ bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain \ --image_dir ~/flowers
but get retrain.py", line 257, in get_image_path mod_index = index % len(category_list) ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
I have got some files, like  flower.jpg.txt.
why the length of category list could be zero?
