Does Tensorflow Lite supports LSTM?

Hi,
Tensorflow Lite does not supports tf.tanh according to [compatibility guide].(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/g3doc/tf_ops_compatibility.md).
However tf.tanh is usually part of LSTM.
Then, Does TF-Lite support LSTM or not?
Does TF-Lite have compatible operator of BasicLSTMCell?
Thanks.
