0.12.0rc1 windows package for Python 3.5 (x64) does not include lib or include files

I installed the 0.12.0rc1 tensorflow package for Python 3.5 (64 bit) on Windows 10.
I started to try to add running trained models into an existing C++ software package, but the include and lib files specified by the documentation and found with tensorflow.sysconfig.get_include() and .get_lib() don't exist They return values:
In [5]: tensorflow.sysconfig.get_include()
Out[5]: 'e:\\python35\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\include'

In [6]: tensorflow.sysconfig.get_lib()
Out[6]: 'e:\\python35\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\core'

But these directories do not exist. I do not know if there is a problem with the package or the documentation.
