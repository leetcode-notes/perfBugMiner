NADAM Optimizer

Implements Nadam - a published variant of Adam Optimizer with Nestov momentum
Same basic algorithm used by the Nadam Optimizer in Keras (https://keras.io/optimizers/#nadam) but implemented from scratch by me for TF's dense / gpu kernels
Cites academic references for source algorithms
