Feature Request: Allow extending Estimator

Our model is time based and we are doing continuous training and eval on the same machine. The model is very large and takes 1+ minutes to load, so we don't want the overhead of reloading the graph and weights every time we switch from training to eval #13895 (comment).
I tried to subclass Estimator to override the _train_model fn but it is not allowed due to this white-list. Can you remove this restriction and let people override methods at their own peril?
Subclasses of Estimator cannot override members of Estimator. <class ... does override ['_train_model'] (relates to #12908).
