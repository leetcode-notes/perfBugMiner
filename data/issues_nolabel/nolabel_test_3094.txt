Fix path to boringssl_err_data_c in workspace.bzl.

Passing in an absolute path for path_prefix gave me this error:
invalid package name '.../boringssl': package names may not start with '/'.

I believe the intent was to refer to the target within the TF repo, and
I think that tf_repo_name is supposed to accomplish this.
