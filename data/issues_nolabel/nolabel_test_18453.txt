Slim Train API doesn't provide control to user to extract loss and accuracy metrics

I am referring to train_image_classifier.py script provided by Tensorflow for image classification.
Script uses slim.learning.train API to kick off the training and then it takes care for everything internally.
Though it logs the metrics i.e. loss/accuracy but that's all internal to slim. I doesn't provide handle to get periodic updates of loss/accuracy in my script while training is going on.
My requirement is to extract loss and accuracy metrics after every n number of epochs, i.e. 5 and dump that into database for later analysis.
But because of high level abstraction of slim train API, It seems there is now way to get periodic updates loss/accuracy info during the training.
Is it possible to tap the training process and get the loss/accuracy values after every given number of steps/epochs ?
If it's possible, please share the pseudo code for that.
It will be really helpful for me.
Thanks.
