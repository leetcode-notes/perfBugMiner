run on gpu in tensorflow backend .

Hi,
How can  be sure that the tensorflow+keras  run on GPU?i use tensorflow+keras with backend   .
Although in keras manual Written ;"If you are running on the TensorFlow or CNTK backends, your code will automatically run on GPU if any available GPU is detected"
How can this be checked?
Thanks.
