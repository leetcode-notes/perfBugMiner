Fix wrong error message for beta distribution

This PR fixes the assertion failure message for Beta distribution's valid sample check, which is currently incorrect. For a sample with value 1.0, the current error message is: sample must be no larger than '1', wrongly suggesting that sample can be 1.0. After this PR, the will say, sample must be less than '1'.
