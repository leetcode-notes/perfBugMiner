partial_run segfault

Running partial_run twice results in a segfault. By running twice I mean: setting up placeholder, ops and completing one run through the graph and then trying to do another run.
Environment info
Operating System: Linux.
Version: 0.7.1
Hash: 028d0b4
Steps to reproduce
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python import array_ops
from tensorflow.python import math_ops
from tensorflow.python.framework import dtypes
sess = tf.Session()

a = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
b = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
r1 = math_ops.add(a, b)

h = sess.partial_run_setup([r1], [a, b])
res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})

h = sess.partial_run_setup([r1], [a, b])
res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})

> Segmentation fault (core dumped)

What have you tried?

Changing execution target to CPU instead of GPU (same problem)
Reusing the same handle for the second run results in a StatusNotOK error because the input has already been fed
