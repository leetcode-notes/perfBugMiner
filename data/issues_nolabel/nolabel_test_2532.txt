Tensorflow Anaconda Import Module Error

I installed Anaconda Environment Installation with Python 3.5 for 64-bit on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
I created the conda environment for tensorflow in 3.4 and installed tensorflow 0.8.0 version for python 3.
After activating tensorflow source, I typed in python and imported sklearn & skflow. But it gives me an import error.
When I install both sklearn & skflow using pip within activated tensorflow environment. It does work for that session only. After I deactivate and activate again, it starts giving an error again.
