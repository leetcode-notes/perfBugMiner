Eliminate ':' in summary name of contrib.learn.estimators.

When I run the contrib.learn.DNNRegressor or contrib.learn.DNNClassifier model, I've got the log messages like below.
INFO:tensorflow:Summary name dnn/hiddenlayer_0:fraction_of_zero_values is illegal; using dnn/hiddenlayer_0_fraction_of_zero_values instead.
INFO:tensorflow:Summary name dnn/hiddenlayer_0:activation is illegal; using dnn/hiddenlayer_0_activation instead.
INFO:tensorflow:Summary name dnn/hiddenlayer_1:fraction_of_zero_values is illegal; using dnn/hiddenlayer_1_fraction_of_zero_values instead.
INFO:tensorflow:Summary name dnn/hiddenlayer_1:activation is illegal; using dnn/hiddenlayer_1_activation instead.

Tensorboard show me that the characters ':' in these summary name were replaced by '_'.
I think this change doesn't cause any big incompatibility issues.
