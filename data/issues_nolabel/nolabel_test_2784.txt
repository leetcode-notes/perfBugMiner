Lite runtime is not supported in proto3

compiling proto3 for ios with tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_ios_protobuf.sh an error is thrown on the make step:
google/protobuf/unittest_proto3_arena_lite.proto: Lite runtime is not supported in proto3.
It seems that Lite support has been added to the master branch of protobuf however: google/protobuf#1443
any idea why this error persists? Same for a clean pull and install of tf, as well as a couple of other proto branches.
