a CUDA runtime call was likely performed without using a StreamExecutor context

I want use my pylearn2 dataset code with tensorflow. But when I add from pylearn2.datasets.dense_design_matrix import DefaultViewConverter into mnist convolutional.py and run it in my server, I get this errors:
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:302] current context was not created by the StreamExecutor cuda_driver API: 0x38e0330; a CUDA runtime call was likely performed without using a StreamExecutor context Aborted (core dumped)
My server is GTX980 with 8 core CPU, I will get that errors in my server. But I can run it in my desktop PC with GTX960/GTX970 and 4 core CPU and I don't get any errors. All the cuda version is same in my machices.
Does anyone can help me?
the full traceback is:
