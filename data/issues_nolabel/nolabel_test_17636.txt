Fix broken link in programmers_guide/faq and some minor format

As we can see in programmer_guide/faq, there are two broken links:
The first one:

See the how-to documentation for @{$reading_data#creating-threads-to-prefetch-using-queuerunner-objects$using QueueRunner objects to drive queues and readers} for more information on how to use them.

The seconde one:

If your data is not easily parsable with the built-in TensorFlow operations, consider converting it, offline, to a format that is easily parsable, such as ${tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter$TFRecord} format.

This PR is to fix the first broken link thru replace '-' with '_' and fix the second broken link thru replacing the begining '$' with '@'.
Besides, I think there might be some format issue on the '*' which I assume they should be used to highlight the "In particular" and "With one exception" sentence.

The TensorFlow Python API adheres to the PEP8 conventions.* In particular, we use CamelCase names for classes, and snake_case names for functions, methods, and properties. We also adhere to the Google Python style guide.
The TensorFlow C++ code base adheres to the Google C++ style guide.
(* With one exception: we use 2-space indentation instead of 4-space indentation.)
