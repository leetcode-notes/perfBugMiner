The name 'final_result:0' refers to a Tensor which does not exist. The operation, 'final_result', does not exist in the graph.

System information
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Tensorflow 1.2.1
Having done a clean install of Tensorflow, I have rebuilt the model using training data which went fine. On classifying I receive:
  File "/home/tass/OpenTass/Tensorflow/TassClassifier.py", line 235, in classify
    softmaxTensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_result:0')
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2733, in get_tensor_by_name
    return self.as_graph_element(name, allow_tensor=True, allow_operation=False)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2584, in as_graph_element
    return self._as_graph_element_locked(obj, allow_tensor, allow_operation)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 2626, in _as_graph_element_locked
    "graph." % (repr(name), repr(op_name)))
KeyError: "The name 'final_result:0' refers to a Tensor which does not exist. The operation, 'final_result', does not exist in the graph."

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
