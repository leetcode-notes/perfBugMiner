build from source fails

i just built the latest bazel from source, and pulled the latest tensorflow from source, and ran this to compile tensor:
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
After running for awhile, it failed with this error:
ERROR: /home/brett/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorboard/bower/BUILD:3:1: no such package '@plottable//': Unexpected end of file from server and referenced by '//tensorflow/tensorboard/bower:bower'.
ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.
