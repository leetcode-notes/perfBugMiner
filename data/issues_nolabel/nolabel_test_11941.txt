Where can I find "gen_checkpoint_ops"

When I was debuging inception v4, there has a message:
"22 from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops import gen_checkpoint_ops
23 from tensorflow.contrib.util import loader
24 from tensorflow.python.framework import dtypes
ImportError: cannot import name gen_checkpoint_ops
".
But I can't find a module or package named "gen_checkpoint_ops".
I don't know how to resolve this problem.
Help!
