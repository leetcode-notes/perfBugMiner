No way to re-enter previous name/variable-scoped context

As far as I can tell, there is no way to re-enter the same name_scope or variable_scope (once closed) without the name being "unique-ified."
The example in the docs shows how to re-enter the original scope from within a nested scope - but not when context is closed.
Perhaps this could be solved by enabling access to the scope reference as tf.Variable.scope ?
Current hack-y workaround is to manually specify variable name as "{}/name".format(previous_scope_name)
