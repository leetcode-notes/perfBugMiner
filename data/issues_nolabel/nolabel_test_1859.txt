Python 2 linux GPU nightly link in readme is wrong

Hey! I wanted to try out the scan op, so I installed the latest. however, on doing so, I discovered that no nightly build has been attempted in jenkins for about 20 days. if this is simply because one has not been run, could someone at google hit build and then take a look at why it hasn't run?
Note: I don't mean it's failed; I mean there are no builds in the list newer than that, failed or otherwise.
In the meantime, I'll install from source.
Environment info
Operating System: Linux; Ubuntu/14.04

What are you about to try?

building from source.
