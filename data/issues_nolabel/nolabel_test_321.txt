Don't require absolute path when specifying tensorboard logs dir

When running tensorboard on Mac OS X currently, you have to specify the absolute directory to the logs path in order to get it to run.
tensorboard --logdir /Users/myusername/Code/tensor-play/tf-play/linear_regression/logs/events
It should accept relative paths (like most unix commands) for convenience.
tensorboard --logdir logs/events
