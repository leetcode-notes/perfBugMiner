Interface improvement suggestions for tf.tranpose and tf.slice

I would like to suggest the following improvements for the interfaces of tf.transpose and tf.slice.

tf.transpose currently accepts a boolean mask that selects the dimensions to be reversed. AFAIK this is the only op in Tensorflow that uses a mask for this purpose, whereas other, e.g. tf.reduce_***, take an axis number or a list of axis numbers. I think tf.tranpose could also be changed accordingly.
tf.slice signature is tf.slice(input_, begin, size, name=None), and it is very unusual for Python that the slices are defined by their size, not by their end. Also, there is a slice object in Python, which would be a very natural argument for tf.slice.
