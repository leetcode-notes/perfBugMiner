Missing support for Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
none (using CPU version)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
What have you tried?
I tried to install
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl

but it failed with the following message:
tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

This is probably because the python3 version in Xenial is Python 3.5.x
I managed to install tensorflow using instead:
linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl

but there's not anything like that neither for the protobuf nor for the tensorflow-0.8.0 packages.
