Stream Executor: perform a cudnn library vs. binary check, add relu6/x support.

During initialization, we check whether the loaded version
of the cudnn library matches the version of the library that
the binary was compiled against.  When there is a mismatch,
throw an error.
Example: I built with cudnnv5 but I am loading V4, and I get:
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:298] Loaded cudnn library: 4007 but source was compiled against 5004.  If using a binary install, upgrade your cudnn library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded matches the version you specified during compile configuration.
I then copy the v5 version of libcudnn.so into /usr/local/cuda/lib64
and when I re-run the program, the error goes away.
Thoughts, @zheng-xq, @leary-google, @zffchen78 ?
