Build of pip package with current HEAD of bazel fails

Bazel built from it's current head (cc8fd606f2f1878cbb5ed0ff8b533e514818c9dd for me) fails to build the pip package of tensorflow due to exclamation marks occurring in the path of some files. Error message:
ERROR: /home/panmari/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorboard/BUILD:31:1: //tensorflow/tensorboard:all_files: invalid label 'components/prism/tests/languages/css!+css-extras/entity_feature.test' in element 1233 of attribute 'srcs' in 'filegroup' rule: invalid target name 'components/prism/tests/languages/css!+css-extras/entity_feature.test': target names may not contain '!'.

ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.

Simply removing the exclamation mark in the offending paths by renaming them does make the build proceed again. But I still have to check if the tensorboard still works.
