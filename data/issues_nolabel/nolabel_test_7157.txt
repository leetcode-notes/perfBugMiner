AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'constant'

I've just installed tensorflow (without the gpu) on my mac, through my virtual environment. I initially had tensorflow downloaded in my ~/ directory, but then found that I could not import it at all in python3.4. I found that I fixed this by making a copy of the tensorflow directory in my working directory fixed that. But now the problem is that once I import tensorflow with $ import tensorflow as tf, I get the message:
>>> a = tf.constant('Hello') Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'constant'
