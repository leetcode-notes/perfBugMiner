Tensorboard doesn't show anything in 0.12

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
I was having IOErrors but after trying in different browsers. After reading issue #4830, I decided to upgrade tensorflow to 0.12, even when it says the 0.11 is fixed.
A link to the pip package I installed: tensorflow-0.12.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Minimal reproducible example
So, the IOErrors did dissapeared but I stil can't show any graph or scalar or summary. After following the debug everything seems fine:
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is in debug mode.

However, I try again all the browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Chromium) and nothing appear. I'll provide one of the event files I got.
