PIP installation error due to libcuda.so.1 not found

I encountered a strange error after installing tensorflow through pip: the tensorflow says it cannot find libcuda.so.1, which should not exist. Does anyone know how to fix it? Thanks for help!
Environment info
Operating System:
CentOS 6
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
Cuda 7.5 and cudnnv4
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
