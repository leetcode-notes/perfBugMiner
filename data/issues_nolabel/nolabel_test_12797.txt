UINT8 is used but only partly supported in the Java API.

The datatype uint8 exists in the Java API (see DataType.UINT8) and is used by the LabelImage program. However, it does not seem to be fully supported. In particular, elemByteSize() in tensor_jni.cc does not have a case for TF_UINT8, which prevents uint8 tensors from being created or extracted from TensorFlow.
