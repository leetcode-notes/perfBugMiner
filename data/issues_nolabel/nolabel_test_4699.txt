Fail configure script immediately on error.

For lines such as default_python_bin_path=$(which python), add a || true
expression so that if the executable does not exist, the command will not exit
with a non-zero exit code, and the variable will be set to an empty string.
Also, use yes to automate the ./configure script when running CI tests
rather than piping in an empty file, which causes subsequent read commands
to fail.
This change also augments the code in the configure script for resolving the
cuDNN library to search both the case where libcudnn is installed to a lib/lib64
directory (such as /usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64) and when it is not (such as
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu), as well as when the platform is Darwin.
