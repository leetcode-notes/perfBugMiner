using two different models for prediction

Im using the following code to import graph def since i want to use two model files individually.
def initialSetup():
    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'
    start_time = timeit.default_timer()

    # This takes 2-5 seconds to run
    # Unpersists graph from file
    with tf.gfile.FastGFile('age/output_graph.pb', 'rb') as f:
        age_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        age_graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        tf.import_graph_def(age_graph_def, name='')

    with tf.gfile.FastGFile('output_graph.pb', 'rb') as f:
        gender_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        gender_graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        tf.import_graph_def(gender_graph_def, name='')

    print ('Took {} seconds to unpersist the graph'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time))


but how do I use them after importing individually ? I tried adding name ='age' and name = 'gender' to differentiate but it is not working out as well.
