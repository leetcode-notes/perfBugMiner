Udacity word2vec notebook: more explicit examples for batch generation algo

@vincentvanhoucke As I struggled a bit (with pen & paper) to make sense of what's really happening in the generate_batch function of the word2vec notebook, I'd like to offer this revision, with examples which make it a bit more explicit IMO. Here's a link to the rendered version of what I'm proposing:
