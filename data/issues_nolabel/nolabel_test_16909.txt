Add doc on the order of eigenvalues returned by tf.self_adjoint_eig

Resolves #16747
As discussed in #16747, I think we can add doc on the order of eigenvalues returned by tf.self_adjoint_eig. But further discussion may be required. Any opinions will be appreciated.
Eigen doc says:

The eigenvalues are repeated according to their algebraic multiplicity, so there are as many eigenvalues as rows in the matrix. The eigenvalues are sorted in increasing order.

And CUDA doc says:

a real array of dimension n. The eigenvalue values of A, in ascending order ie, sorted so that W(i) <= W(i+1).

The key point is whether we should add this order constraint to TensorFlow itself. Will tf.self_adjoint_eig move to other implementation that does not guarantee ascending order one day?
