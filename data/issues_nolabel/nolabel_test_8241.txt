[feature] Logging Support from Custom Op

Repost from SO
Provide method and documentation for how to log from within a custom op. built in ops using VLOG to log, however that does not work for custom ops. I have defined my own op and in it I use VLOG however when I try to run the Op I get:
NotFoundError: dlopen(/Users/alex/git/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/core/user_ops/my_op.so, 6): Symbol not found: __ZN10tensorflow8internal10LogMessage12MinVLogLevelEv
  Referenced from: /Users/alex/git/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/core/user_ops/my_op.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in /Users/alex/git/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/core/user_ops/my_op.so

Ideally there would be some suggestion or note in the docs about how to handle logging.
