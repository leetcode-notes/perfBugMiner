building tensorflow from source / general issue

Dear Tensorflow team,
I was facing a problem described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45859371/error-building-tensorflow-on-centos-7
In short words: In the documentation there is no any single word about bazel version need for specific version of Tensorflow. In particular, I could not build a Python package with the newest version of Bazel. Experimentally I found out that that the master version (r1.3) can be built successfully with Bazel not newer than 0.5.1. (with very old versions it also doesn't work).
So I am kindly asking to mention a Bazel version (as well as other dependencies, such as gcc, etc) to have successful build for the next releases.
I spent a lot of time to find a solution. Probably it will be useful experience for others.
Cheers,
Sergey
