Feature Request: No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in tf.contrib.bayesflow

The NUTS sampler (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/hoffman14a/hoffman14a.pdf) would be a great addition to the HMC code already in tf.contrib.bayesflow.
A reference implementation is at: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/hmc/nuts/base_nuts.hpp, and this has already been mentioned by @jvdillon and @dustinvtran in #4965. The HMC code has been brought over, but I don't see NUTS in there.
Is someone already working on this? Is there any way I could help?
