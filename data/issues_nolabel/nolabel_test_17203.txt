Modify distributed TF examples to take kubeflow's TF_CONFIG as well as command line arguments.

Currently most of the examples under tensorflow/tools/dist_test require command line arguments to be passed in to construct the cluster spec.
The tensorflow operator is standardizing under a representation of the cluster spec within a variable called TF_CONFIG, which looks like this:
{"cluster":{"master":["myjob237-master-06pz-0:2222"],"ps":["myjob237-ps-06pz-0:2222","myjob237-ps-06pz-1:2222"],"worker":["myjob237-worker-06pz-0:2222"]},"task":{"type":"master","index":0},"environment":"cloud"}

It would be ideal of the examples were modified to take this variable so we can reduce the shimming required in Kubeflow related efforts, without breaking backward compatibility and keeping the command line args.
