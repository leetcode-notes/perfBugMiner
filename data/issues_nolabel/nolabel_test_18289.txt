I can't transfer .pb file to .tflite file

Hi,
I trained a model with keras framework. And i saved model as .pb file. This model takes input as "String Array" and gives out as "String Array" .I want use this model on Android device. Therefore, i use TOCO but i can't give true  --input_shaped and --inference_type parameters.  I use this toco command
bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/toco --input_file=modelimtest.pb --input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF --output_format=TFLITE --output_file=modelim.lite --inference_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8 --input_arrays=input_1 --output_arrays=activation_1/truediv input_shaped=
How can i change this command line for my problem?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.7
Python version: 3.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: Cuda 9.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1050
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
