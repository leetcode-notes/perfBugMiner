Remove errorneous squeeze in `tf.contrib.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_loss`

The tf.contrib.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_loss has an weights parameter which can be used to weight the individual batch elements. The weights parameter can have various shape, which are all taken care of in compute_weighted_loss.
However, the sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_loss methods contains an errorneous squeeze of the weights. If some dimension of weights is not known, the number of dimensions after the squeeze is unknown, which causes the compute_weighted_loss method to throw an exception. However, if the squeeze in sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_loss is not called, compute_weighted_loss can deal even with unknown dimensions of weights.
Note that tf.contrib.losses.softmax_cross_entropy_loss does not contain the squeeze of the weights, even if it uses the weights argument in an equal way.
Should fix #6846.
