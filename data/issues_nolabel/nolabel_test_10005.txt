Py_func call slows down scipy

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04.4 and MacOS 10.12.4 are affected
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): tried both, reproduces on both
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.0.1 and 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: both on Tesla K80 and on CPU version
Exact command to reproduce: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/dl.dropbox.com/s/z19wv70ogo15xg0/eigh%20speed%20bug.ipynb

Output of the enviromental script: https://pastebin.com/qdi8tJRV
Describe the problem
Calling np.lianlg.svd via tf.py_fun forces scipy.linalg.eigh to become slower for some reason (4x slower on a server and 1.5x slower on my laptop). Here is the line that causes problems:
ret = tf.py_func(np.linalg.svd, [np.random.randn(2, 300)], [tf.float64, tf.float64, tf.float64])
%timeit sess.run(ret)

Before this line scipy.linalg.eigh used CPU for 2400% and worked in 13ms, after it it uses CPU for 600% and works in 43ms.
