How can I use all of cpu cores in android

Hi,
Thank your for your work.
In my app, I use tensorflow to classify.  But CPU usage are lower, just about 30%. My device has 4 cores.  I want to use all CPUs to reduce cost time. I try to modify intra_op_parallelism_threads and  inter_op_parallelism_threads, when compile the libtensorflow_inference.so.  And use TF_SetConfig to set  TF_SessionOptions.ã€€But it doesn't work.
Can you give me some advice?  thank you.
