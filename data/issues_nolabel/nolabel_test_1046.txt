Graphs tab on TensorBoard failing with a JavaScript error

Built from TOT today (Feb 10th) with GPU support.  TensorBoard loads and the Events tab works, but when I go to the Graph tab, I see Uncaught TypeError: Polymer.dom(...).unobserveNodes is not a function.
I'm a TensorFlow rookie, so good chance I did something wrong.
