Variable "weights" does not exist with BasicLSTMcell or LSTMBlockCell

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): via pip with GPU support
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1
GPU model and memory: GPU Titan X

Describtion of the problem
I am trying to use LSTM cell, but when I make the call to it, I receive an ValueError message saying that the variable weights is does not exist or not created with get_variable().
I looked into the tensorflow source code of the BasicLSTMCell or LSTMBlockCell and we can see that the weights matrix is getted by a call to tf.get_variable()... So it seems to be a bug, right ?
Does someone can tell me if I made a mistake of if it is a bug ?
NB: Note that i tried several other solution with variable_scope instead of name_scope, with reuse = True, of False , with no success ...
Source code / logs :
here is the source code of BasicLSTMCell and LSTMBlockCell
the call to get_variable into LSTMBlockCell _call funtion
w = vs.get_variable(self._names["W"], [input_size + self._num_units,
                                             self._num_units * 4])

and into the _linear function used by BasicLSTMCell
weights = vs.get_variable(
_WEIGHTS_VARIABLE_NAME, [total_arg_size, output_size], dtype=dtype)

here is my source code
lstm_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockCell(num_units=self._state_size)
for t in range(self._rnn_step):
    with tf.name_scope('lstm'):
    _, (c, h) = lstm_cell(lstm_input, [c, h], scope=tf.get_variable_scope())

here is the error message

ValueError: Variable weights does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
