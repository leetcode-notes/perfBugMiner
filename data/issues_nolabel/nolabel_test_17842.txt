Fix deprecated api call in _NonAtrousConvolution

System information
I am using tf version 1.7.0-dev20180317, v1.6.0-rc1-1580-gc941c087a9 on OSX in standard non-eager mode.
Describe the problem
Lines 151-156 in class _NonAtrousConvolution in tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py set nhwc as data format when conv_dims is 1.
    151     if conv_dims == 1:
    152       # conv1d uses the 2-d data format names
    153       if data_format is None or data_format == "NWC":
    154         data_format_2d = "NHWC"
    155       elif data_format == "NCW":
    156         data_format_2d = "NCHW"
But this causes a warning later on at line 2384 when conv1d is called from inside the _conv1d method at line 189
WARNING:tensorflow:From ~/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py:497: calling conv1d (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with data_format=NHWC is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
`NHWC` for data_format is deprecated, use `NWC` instead
