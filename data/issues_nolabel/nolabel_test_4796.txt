Make tutorial_example_trainer build on Windows with Bazel

With these changes, we are able to build the C++ example trainer by
bazel build --host_cpu=x64_windows_msvc --cpu=x64_windows_msvc -c opt tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
with Bazel from HEAD on Windows.
I modified the BUILD files carefully, hopefully it won't break TF build on other platform.
