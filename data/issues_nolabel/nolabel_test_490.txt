Error in TF.pad API docs

Please note the following error in tf.pad in "array_ops.md":
Example 1 currently reads as follows:
# 't' is [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
# 'paddings' is [[1, 1]], [2, 2]] ##This is not a valid tensor
# rank of 't' is 2
pad(t, paddings) ==> 
     [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ##This is not the correct output
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
     [[0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

It can be fixed as follows:
# 't' is [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
# 'paddings' is [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
# rank of 't' is 2
pad(t, paddings) ==> 
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
