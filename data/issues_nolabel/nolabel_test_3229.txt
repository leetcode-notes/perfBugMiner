maximize function added to Optimizer

I have added a Maximize() function to the Optimizer.  This makes efforts where maximizing a function straight forward to implement.
I have used the "minimize()" function as a model, created "maximize()" and simply inverted the sign to the cost of the "compute_gradients()" function.
This is my first attempt at an update on Github, please let me know if there is an error in the request.
