Bug: placeholder input to tf.one_hot leads to hang

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0 / cuDNN 6.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080 Ti 11GB
Exact command to reproduce: see below

Describe the problem
I'm not sure if you're not supposed to feed in a placeholder to tf.one_hot, but if you do, it hangs and chews up 100% CPU.
Source code / logs
Minimal example to reproduce bug:
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()
p = tf.placeholder(tf.uint8, 1)
x = tf.one_hot(p, depth=10)
res = sess.run(x, feed_dict={p: [3]})
print(res)
The expected result should be either (1) it works and prints [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], or (2) it produces some kind of error.
