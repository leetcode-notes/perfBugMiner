Extended adjust_hue and adjust_saturation to work on 4D tensors

I noticed that adjust_hue and adjust_saturation only worked on single images (3D tensors), but I couldn't really see a reason for that, so I extended it to work on 4D. I don't know if you want this in the main repo?
I based the work on the r0.9 branch because that's what I'm using, but I can do it for the master branch if that is more suitable.
