Error in string_input_producer

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 15.04
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: c1a40c7
Steps to reproduce
Run the following commands:
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
filenames = ["1", "2", "3"]
filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(filenames)
test_value = tf.convert_to_tensor(filename_queue.size())
print(sess.run([test_value]))

For me, this last command returns [0]. If I'm understanding things right, I'm assuming it should return [3]. I've also tried to run the dequeue() op, which appears to hang and become unresponsive.
It's also possible I'm just completely misunderstanding how this is supposed to work - in which case, please disregard!
