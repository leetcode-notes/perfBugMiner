AVX512 support is not functional (does not compile etc)

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
there is an existing issue but it's very vague and at the same time too specific
Environment info
Operating System:
Linux
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
no cuda
Current AVX512 support does not function, for example with
bazel build -c opt  --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mavx512f --copt=-O3 --copt=-march=skylake --copt=-mfma --copt=-g1  //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
there are various compile errors. I'm filing this ticket more as a grab bag than it being about a specific compile error; as work is done we can add specific failures to this bug.
If nobody else is working on this I can try to assign someone at work to this, but if there's already code floating around to fix this then I'm more than happy to defer to that.
