Initializing saver after variables are initialized and queue runners are started causes inconsistent behaviour.

What have you tried?

Tried running the exact same code with a saver that saves no values and no saver.  Simply initializing the saver at the wrong time is sufficient to cause weird behaviour.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
App will crash intermittently somewhere completely unrelated in code (usually native).
I know this is user error, but it would have been really helpful if an exception had been raised.  I wasted a lot of time trying to hunt down a mystery error when it turned out it was the saver all along.  This can be confusing to beginners such as myself.
