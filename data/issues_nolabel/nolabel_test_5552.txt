[docs] python3 bytes -> string in example in README

The current README.md indicates the following "first TensorFlow program":
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello)
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a+b)
42
>>>

This works fine under python2, but handling of strings has changed slightly in python3. Suggested improvement to the example program for compatibility with both python2 and python3 (we need to convert bytes to string):
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello).decode("utf-8")
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a+b)
42

Tested from the wheel build of 0.11.0 (final), converted to RPM, on Fedora 24/25.
Thanks!
