Add PSGLD optimizer

I add an algorithm, Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (PSGLD), for training optimization, which

derives from Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and SGD,
requires only the gradient on mini-batches of data,
incorperates adaptive preconditioners from RMSProp.

And it effectively accelerates the convergence speed compared with the existed algorithms, while basically maintaining the accuracy of prediction.
