Why 'tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter' is so SLOW and STORAGE-CONSUMING in TensorFlow?

I'm going to write to TFRecord file using this code The problem is that this process is very slow, such that it's not feasible to write a large dataset even in days! It's just a writer that serialize to disk. Why it's so slow?! Another problem is that the size of the output file is 10 times greater than the original file!
does anyone know any way to speed up the process of TFRecordWriter and compress the result?
