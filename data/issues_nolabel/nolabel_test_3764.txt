iOS: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'RandomShuffleQueue' with these attrs

I am trying to load the simple trained model, but I am facing the following issue:
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'RandomShuffleQueue' with these attrs

[[Node: shuffle_batch_1/random_shuffle_queue = RandomShuffleQueue[capacity=1003, 
component_types=[DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT], container="", min_after_dequeue=1000,
seed=0, seed2=0, shapes=[[227,227,3], [10], [18]], shared_name=""]()]]

Thanks,
