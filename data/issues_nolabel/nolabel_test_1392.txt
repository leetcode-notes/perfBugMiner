Minor Error in Tutorial

On this tutorial page, it says that the MNIST data has been rescaled to [-.5, .5]:
"The image data is extracted into a 2d tensor of: [image index, pixel index] where each entry is the intensity value of a specific pixel in a specific image, rescaled from [0, 255] to [-0.5, 0.5]."
However, in the code, the data is rescaled to [0,1] as per the comment on line 123 (and confirmed by loading a sample image and inspecting):
# Convert from [0, 255] -> [0.0, 1.0].
Just a minor error, but thought it was worth pointing out! I'm actually curious which is the better method of rescaling, but that's a topic for another discussion..
