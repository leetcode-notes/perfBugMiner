Does the released Inception-v3 model only support forward pass with batch_size=1?

Hi all,
I am new to TF. I am playing with Inception-v3 model and I found that I can only pass batch_size=1 to the model. Here is my test code:
import tensorflow.python.platform
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile
import numpy as np


with tf.device("/cpu:0"):
    with gfile.FastGFile('/tmp/imagenet/classify_image_graph_def.pb', 'rb') as f:
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

with tf.Session() as sess:

    array = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 3)
    image_data = tf.convert_to_tensor(array, dtype=tf.float32).eval()

    test_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('Mul:0')
    print(test_tensor.get_shape())
    softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('softmax:0')
    predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor,
                          {'Mul:0': image_data})
If I change array = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 3) with batch_size=2, then TF would complain about the size mismatch.
Am I doing something wrong? Any pointer would be of great help.
