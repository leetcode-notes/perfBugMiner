Cannot create a tensor of shape (?), but can create a tensor of shape (?, 1)

I tried to create a tensor of dynamic shape.
shape = tf.shape(boxes) # boxes' shape is unknown 
batch_inds = tf.zeros((shape[0]), dtype=tf.int32, name='batch_inds')     # fails
batch_inds = tf.zeros((shape[0], 1), dtype=tf.int32, name='batch_inds')  # works
batch_inds = tf.reshape(batch_inds, [-1])                     
tf.image.crop_and_resize(images, boxes, batch_inds,
                                     [pooled_height, pooled_width],
                                     method='bilinear',
                                     name='Crop')

hmmm.. it seems a little bit clumsy to write code this way.
