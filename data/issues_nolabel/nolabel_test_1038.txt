sequence_loss_by_example()  type error for rnn/ptb

Hi
I downloaded 0.6.0 for python 2.7 and I tried running the rnn/ptb example but got a type error:
$ python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=/this/path/ --model small
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:40] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 8
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc:58] Direct session inter op parallelism threads: 8

TypeError: sequence_loss_by_example() takes at least 4 arguments (3 given)
It seems that this sequence_loss_by_example() method is imported from seq2seq which imports it from tensorflow.python.ops.seq2seq. Beyond that I'm not really sure how this happened.
Thanks
