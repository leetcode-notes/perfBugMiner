Mixture of multivariate distributions

Consider a mixture of 2-dimensional Gaussians in TensorFlow:
ds = tf.contrib.distributions

cat = ds.Categorical(probs=[0.3, 0.2, 0.5])
comps = [ds.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=[-5.0, -5.0], scale_diag=tf.ones(2)),
         ds.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=[0.0, 0.0], scale_diag=tf.ones(2)),
         ds.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=[5.0, 5.0], scale_diag=tf.ones(2))]

mix = ds.Mixture(cat=cat, components=comps)
This works because each MultivariateNormalDiag distribution has a batch shape of (). It is compatible with the Categorical's batch shape.
Now consider a mixture of 2-dimensional Bernoulli's, or Gamma's, or Laplace, or StudentT's. We need an equivalent MultivariateBernoulli, MultivariateGamma, etc. distribution which allows us to fix the batch shape and increase the event shape.
Are there plans to make such distributions available?
What about edge cases such as a matrixvariate (k-variate) Bernoulli, where additional parameter dimensions determine the batch shape and the event shape is fixed at 2 (k)?
