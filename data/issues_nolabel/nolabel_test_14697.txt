tf.train.Scaffold does't accept global_step, and therefore only one checkpoint (0) is saved

Disclaimer: Issue #10661 might be related.
When I create a Scaffold object and attempt to use it in a MonitoredTrainingSession, there is no ability to specify the global step.  As a consequence (I think), only one checkpoint is created, labeled "model.ckpt-0".
As I understand it, the code below (taken from a custom class I've written...hence the selfs) should save a new checkpoint every 10 seconds, but only actually creates a single checkpoint at the start of training, and then never again.
self.GLOBAL_STEP = tf.train.get_or_create_global_step()
self.init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()       
self.Saver = tf.train.Saver()

self.Scaffold = tf.train.Scaffold( init_op=self.init_op,
                                   saver=self.Saver
                               #   global_step=self.GLOBAL_STEP  
                                       )

self.sess = tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession( master='',
                                               is_chief=True,
                                               scaffold = self.Scaffold,
                                               checkpoint_dir='./chkpt/',
                                               save_checkpoint_secs=10,
                                                   )

If I uncomment the global_step=... line above, I get an error (as expected) since Scaffold.__init__() doesn't take a global_step argument, however shouldn't it?
