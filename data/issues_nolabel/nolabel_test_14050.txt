Feature request: Exporting TensorBoard graphs to graphviz DOT files

As recently discussed on the TensorFlow mailing list (https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/discuss/GUW0KOmN7MM/2lRMD4JVAQAJ), it would be nice if TensorBoard would have an option to export a graph as graphviz DOT file. This would allow users and developers to create e.g., Python packages based on pygraphviz that can further modify the graph structure, such as simplifying or summarizing the graph ops into a publication-ready figure, etc.
For example, scikit-learn has such a function to export decision trees to DOT files; maybe the source code is useful as an example: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/f3320a6f/sklearn/tree/export.py#L74
