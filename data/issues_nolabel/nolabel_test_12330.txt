Request for computation of hessian wrt tensor of shape 1 x n

There currently exists tf.hessians function which returns 2nd order y derivatives w.r.t. to a specified tensor x. Currently x has to be one dimensional.
In my application, I need to differentiate with respect to a tensor that has dimensions batch_size x layer_width. (I am interested in second derivative of output from neural net with respect to a particular layer.) I can bring dimensionality down to 1 x layer_width, by setting batch_size to 1. Unfortunately, this still does not let me use tf.hessian.
Would it be possible to add functionality where hessian w.r.t. effectively one-dimensional tensors can be computed? So that, for example tensors of shape 1 x n (or 1 x 1 x n) can be used. It feels like it shouldn't be a hard problem, but I'm completely lost when I look at tf.gradients code.
Thanks
