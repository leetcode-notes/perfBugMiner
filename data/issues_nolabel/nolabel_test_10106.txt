Feature request: improve tensorboard embeddings search

Currently, when making a search query using a custom variable, let's say a relevance score, then results display relevance scores. This is not always helpful. In my application, I have word embeddings that I would like to filter by a custom variable (relevance score), and I can't see what word is corresponding to each relevance score (see screenshot).
It would be better to have a separate field so that users can define how they would like to see the results of their search query.
