why does sess.run()so slow on android?

I used retrain.py to retrain inception_v3 with my own images.It works will on pc with label_image.cc.It costs about 2-4s on android demo(just change the graph.pb) once sess.run().In original demo,it costs only 400ms?whats wase,the result always get wrong.I have no idea,why it works so slow?why the accuracy so low on android device?
