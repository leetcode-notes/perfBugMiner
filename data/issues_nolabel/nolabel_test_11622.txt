Enable passing scope to variable lookups

NB: Changes the public API, albeit in a backwards-compatible way.
Especially when copying variables between scopes it's handy to be able to grab sets of variables by scope. This allows the much more succinct:
tf.trainable_variables("myscope")
which is equivalent to:
tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES, "myscope")

Also fixup a minor unrelated documentation bug.
