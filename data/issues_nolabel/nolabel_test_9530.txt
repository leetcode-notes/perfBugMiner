PyCharm won't correctly import tensorflow

I get the following error when I try to run a python program:
ImportError: libcudnn.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I understand this is a simple error most people would encounter when they start tensorflow. I did checked the solutions on Stackoverflow and I managed to run the same program in Terminal. What I did is I made an virtualenv and I activated it and when I try using python3 to run the program it successfully proceeds without any error. However the error always appear when I run the program in PyCharm even with python interpreter set to the location of virtualenv I created. Can someone tell me why as I had no idea why it works in terminal but not with PyCharm.
