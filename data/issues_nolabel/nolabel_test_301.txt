I think there is a small mistake in the tensorflow's documents

I don't know whether it's right to report documents mistakes in this place,i don't find other place to report mistakes...
On tensorflow's website, the introduce of tf.transpose(a, perm=None, name='transpose') in the doc says:
For example:
# 'x' is [[1 2 3]
#         [4 5 6]]
tf.transpose(x) ==> [[1 4]
                     [2 5]
                     [3 6]]

# Equivalently
tf.transpose(x perm=[0, 1]) ==> [[1 4]
                                 [2 5]
                                 [3 6]]

I think the perm should be [1, 0] , not [0, 1].
