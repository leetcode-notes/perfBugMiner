No toolchain found for cpu 'arm64-v8a' when building android demo app

Hi,
I'm trying to build the android demo app with target cpu of 'arm64-v8a', from a mac. With command "bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo --cpu=arm64-v8a", I got the following error:
ERROR: No toolchain found for cpu 'arm64-v8a'. Valid cpus are: [
  darwin,
  armeabi-v7a,
  x64_windows_msvc,
  s390x,
  ios_x86_64,
].

I am able to build with the default target "armeabi-v7a". Any advice?
I'm on a fairly recent SHA: 55a1f26 (the master as of Mar 29). My bazel version is 0.4.5
I specified the NDK path in the WORKSPACE file as the following:
android_ndk_repository(
    name = "androidndk",
    path = "/Users/_user_/Downloads/android-ndk-r12b",
    api_level = 14)

I searched the toolchains under folder /Users/_user_/Downloads/android-ndk-r12b/toolchains and found android-ndk-r12b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm64-v8a. Not sure why bazel does not use it.
