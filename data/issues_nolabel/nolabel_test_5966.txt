How to map '\n' to id in a metadata.tsv when visualizing embedding

I'm quite excited about the new embedding visualization feature in TF 0.12.0-RC0. But when I walk through the new documentation page in the metadata part, it says that the metadata has the exact format with first line as header and others as fields.
What if I have to map char '\n' to id? In this way, the specific format of tsv file will broken. This is often the case in most NLP tasks.
Hope the developer will explain this. thanks.
