Quantization: error during quantizing inception v3 model

Hi experts,
I met issues during quantizing retained inception v3 model. could someone help take a look? Thanks!
Environment: tensorflow-1.4.0, python 3.5.2(Anaconda 4.2.0)
Issue description:
I am using the downloaded inception v3 model, and try to follow the guide written by @petewarden ,. always met the error below:
ValueError: No inputs to quantize for op: name: "conv/Conv2D"
op: "Conv2D"
input: "Mul"
input: "conv/conv2d_params"
...

my python script is as below:
from tensorflow.contrib.quantize.python import quantize_graph
from tensorflow import gfile, GraphDef,import_graph_def,get_default_graph

model_file="classify_image_graph_def.pb"
with gfile.FastGFile(model_file,'rb') as f:
    graph_def = GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    import_graph_def(graph_def,name='')

    graph=get_default_graph()
    q_graph=quantize_graph.create_eval_graph(graph)
    with gfile.FastGFile("output.pb",'wb') as f1:
        f1.write(q_graph.as_graph_def().SerializeToString())
