Add "PlainSessionCreator"

Not sure if this is desirable, but I found this improves the usability of the SessionCreator interface. When I use a factory to create session, it's helpful that it can at least create session in the simplest way.
An example usage would be to write a "train" function that takes a SessionCreator and a bunch of other things.
