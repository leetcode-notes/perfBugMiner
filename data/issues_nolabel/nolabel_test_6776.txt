Siamese Inception model

Already tried on StackOverflow - no success.
Please, help.
How to implement such network in TensorFlow?
    (input_1)    (input_2)
          \         /
(Inception(GoogLeNet) without softmax layer)
          /         \
    (output_1)    (output_2)
             \   / 
        (Contrastive loss) 

I need to reuse weights in Inception for transfer learning.
