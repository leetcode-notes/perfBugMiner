The one_hot_labels in acgan is not pooled in tfgan.gan_loss function.

Describe the problem
I am trying to use tfgan.acgan_model together with tfgan.features.tensor_pool. There are three inputs to the acgan_model, i.e. real_data, generator_inputs, and one_hot_labels. While only two of the inputs (read_data, generator_inputs) are manipulated by tensor_pool in tfgan.gan_loss, which means that the one_hot_labels are incorrectly used in the acgan_discriminator_loss function.
The following is the entrance to the error function call. The one_hot_labels should be read from the tensor pool before this function call.
