1.7.0rc1 cherry-pick request: Fixes a race condition in function instantiation.

This cherry pick fixes a bug that was discovered independently by multiple TPU users after the release branch was cut. The main consequence of not including this change in the release would be flaky crash failures (segmentation faults) in the input pipeline.

Previously, if the same function was being concurrently instantiated
and released:

Thread one could begin to instantiate the function, determine
that it already existed in the runtime, then be preempted.
Thread two could release the handle on the function, causing it to
be freed and removed from the FunctionLibraryRuntime::items_ map.
Thread one could then incorrectly assume that the function still
existed, and fail to find it in the FunctionLibraryRuntime::items_
map, causing a segfault when it attempted to increment the refcount
on an uninitialized object.
