If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf
idx_0 = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, [None])
mask = tf.one_hot(idx_0, 3, axis=-1)
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
a = sess.run([mask],feed_dict={idx_0:[0,1,2]})
print(a)
