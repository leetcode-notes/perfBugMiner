MonitoredTrainingSession can't add summary and checkpoint hook

I trying to add summary and checkpoint to my distributed tensorflow training with custom data
summary_hook = tf.train.SummarySaverHook(save_secs=600,output_dir=FLAGS.log_dir,summary_op=summary_op)
checkpoint_hook = tf.train.CheckpointSaverHook(save_steps=test_timing,checkpoint_dir=FLAGS.log_dir,saver=saver)
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(server.target,is_chief=is_chief,hooks=[sync_replicas_hook,summary_hook,checkpoint_hook],config=sess_config) as sess:
with above I can't run the sess with error of below

how ever if I run without the summary and checkpoint hook it just work fine....
I want to specify which timing and which directory to view my summary and save the checkpoint.
Does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem?
