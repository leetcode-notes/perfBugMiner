Describe the problem
I want to convert a trained model to lite and run it on iPhone,I use command above to convert but it faided:

Input weights "bottle4_1_conv/weights/read_transposed" had shape [ 16, 4, 4, 16 ].

the error information is confused, bottle4_1_conv is a layer using conv_transpose, but it's weights has shape [4,4,16,16] and I run the .pb model in python ,the result is correct, so any idea?
