Remove python boolean check from adjust_gamma

The adjust_gamma operation used a python boolean to check if gamma was positive.  This however removes any possibility of using a scalar tensor, which means it can't be used to apply random augmentations during training.
It is fixed by using a tf.assert_positive statement.
