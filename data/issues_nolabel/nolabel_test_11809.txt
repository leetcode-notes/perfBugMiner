Setting weights for different layers in a CNN

I have a number of models which I have trained in lasagne. I have weights saved for all those models. As of now I want to switch to tensorflow. I can build the whole architecture in tf but I want to load the weights from my hard disk. How can I set the pre-trained weights for the network?
