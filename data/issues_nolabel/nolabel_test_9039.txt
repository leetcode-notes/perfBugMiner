Who can help me fix the problem of 'Net Crash' ?

I am training a convolutional network, but suddenly that happened. I retry for 3 times, same scene happened. The network looks as if it crashed ! Who can help me fix this problem?
The scene looks like the following:
Epoch:100 training_accuracy:0.975 validation_accuracy:0.94242
Epoch:101 training_accuracy:0.075 validation_accuracy:0.103736
Epoch:102 training_accuracy:0.075 validation_accuracy:0.103736
