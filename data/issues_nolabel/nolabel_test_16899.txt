Describe the problem
The 1.5.0 Java API fails at runtime on Ubuntu 14.04 (after working okay for 1.3/1.4) on the hello world example. I originally noticed this behavior in CentOS 7; I'm reporting this as a bug for Ubuntu 14.04 because it is officially supported in the docs and the error appears to be the same.
Possibly related to #15777, in which case the solution may just be to build libtensorflow_jni.so on Ubuntu 14. Thanks in advance for looking into this!
Source code / logs

(Optionally) use docker container with Java 8 and Maven:
docker pull goyalzz/ubuntu-java-8-maven-docker-image
docker run -it goyalzz/ubuntu-java-8-maven-docker-image:latest bash
Follow instructions in official Java API Maven example.
Upon Step 3 of above (mvn -q compile exec:java), observe the following error:
