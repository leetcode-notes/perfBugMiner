Sort shuffled indices before indexing NumpyFeed

It is possible to use h5py datasets with tf.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn as there is a high level of compatibility.
However, with shuffle=True, one can no longer do so due to the following error:
TypeError: Indexing elements must be in increasing order

This small change allows for one to use large HDF5 datasets via h5py with shuffled batch indices.
