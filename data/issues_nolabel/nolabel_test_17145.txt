Feature Request: Add eval metrics to GANEstimator.

At the moment I can't see a way to pass in evaluation metrics (from tfgan) to the GANEstimator when I am using the tf.contrib.Learn.Experiment class. I want to be able to use the tf.contrib.gan.eval functions but can't see a way to do this. Am I missing  something or has this not been implemented?
