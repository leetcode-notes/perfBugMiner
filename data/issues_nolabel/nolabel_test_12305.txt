Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime: error when installing tensorflow. #10026 did not work, #10794 was abandoned

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
I am trying to install GPU-supported version of tensorflow. Regardless of installation method or python version I use, I always get the message down below. Note that CPU version installs and runs without problem.
I have tried uninstalling packages/anaconda/pip and then installing them through ATP, but nothing seems to help.
Thanks beforehand!
