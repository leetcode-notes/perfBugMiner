Change name of sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits to log_loss

Hi folks. This name sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits struck me as strange. In addition to being a mouthful, we're calling it cross_entropy when it really is just binary cross_entropy calculated separately on every node.
The more intuitive name I would give to this function would be log_loss or mean_log_loss (if normalized). I think this would be both easier to write, and easier to understand.
