Running graph in C++

After reading #615 and the related StackOverflow question (which only has one, unsatisfactory answer) I'd like to know what the right way to do this is. Writing a MetaGraphDef proto seems like it would be more convenient than running the freeze_graph python script, but I'm not sure how to read the MetaGraphDef with the C++ Session API.
