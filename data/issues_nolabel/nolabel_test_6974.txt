Race condition in EventFileWriter

There is a race condition here in EventFileWriter: here
    if not gfile.IsDirectory(self._logdir):
      gfile.MakeDirs(self._logdir)
It is possible for multiple concurrent threads and/or processes to get to this code simultaneously, both check IsDirectory, return False, then both try creating the directory, and have one succeed and one error.
This can be fixed by by catching the AlreadyExistsError from MakeDirs and handling it gracefully.
(this is a real issue that we have encountered in daily usage and causes us issues, not just a hypothetical)
