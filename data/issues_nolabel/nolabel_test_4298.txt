it allocates on all specified devices (GPU Memory usage is high on Nvidia-smi), but does not do computations (no memory utilization from Nvidia-smi while the program is running)

Tensorflow it allocates on all specified devices (GPU Memory usage is high on Nvidia-smi), but does not do computations (no memory utilization from Nvidia-smi while the program is running),what's wrong
