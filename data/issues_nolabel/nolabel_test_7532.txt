[#issue7328]Validate ip address in distributed computation

#issue7328
inet_pton() is a recommended and general way to validate ip address(including IPv4 and IPv6) both in linux and Windows.
@mrry  Do I add the validation in the right place? I would add some unit tests tomorrow morning.
BTW:Does TensorFlow support IPv6 now?
