`tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist` not currently downloadable

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("/tmp/data/", one_hot=True)
raises http.client.RemoteDisconnected: Remote end closed connection without response, if you don't already have the data cached. I believe this is because the underlying data SOURCE_URL is currently down.
