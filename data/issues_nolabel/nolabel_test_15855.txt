Export inception model after retrain

The are many issues and Stackoverflow posts asking how to export a retrained Inception model: tensorflow/serving#449, tensorflow/serving#33, tensorflow/serving#7. It would be nice if retrain.py did this so that it's easier for newcomers to use Tensorflow Serving.
This PR exports the model after retrain is finished. I've also added a comment on how to serve the retrained model.
Confirmed works for tensorflow version 1.4.1.
