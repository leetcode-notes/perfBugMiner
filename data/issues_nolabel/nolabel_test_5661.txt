Why does encoder not have mask option in Seq2Seq model ?

Hi, all,
There is a confusion that tf's seq2seq models don't have mask option for sequence padding.
As I know, mask and padding always are together. If without mask, the final result of padding is imprecise. And tf's rnns have implemented mask.
So why does seq2seq not have mask option?
#rnn
def rnn(cell, inputs, initial_state=None, dtype=None,
        sequence_length=None, scope=None):

# seq2seq
def embedding_rnn_seq2seq(encoder_inputs,
                          decoder_inputs,
                          cell,
                          num_encoder_symbols,
                          num_decoder_symbols,
                          embedding_size,
                          output_projection=None,
                          feed_previous=False,
                          dtype=None,
                          scope=None):
