TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'Tensor'

I'm trying to convert a the initializer form from tf.Variable to tf.get_variable for Cudnn_GRU but I keep getting this error. I have to convert because tensorflow does not allow initializing in loop/control-flow functions and only allow lambda initializers or through tf.get_variable
I have reduced the problem into the following minimal example:
import tensorflow as tf
e = tf.random_uniform_initializer(-0.1, 0.1)
i = tf.constant(0)
def func():
    gru_fw = tf.contrib.cudnn_rnn.CudnnGRU(num_layers=1, num_units=75, input_size=25)
    # original line: commented out and working if not under a control flow mechanism
    # param_fw = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([gru_fw.params_size()], -0.1, 0.1), validate_shape=False)
    # converted line
    param_fw = tf.get_variable("abcd", shape=[gru_fw.params_size()],initializer=e, validate_shape=False)
    return param_fw

def func2():
    ### repeat the same thing from func1
    pass

result = tf.cond(tf.equal(i, tf.constant(0)),func,func2)

The traceback is as follows:
