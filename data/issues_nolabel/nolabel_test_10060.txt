[XLA] [macOS] tfcompile via tf_library does not work on macOS

I am trying to compile a model using XLA on macOS. I know the XLA is still in experimental stage, but I would be happy to help fix the problem. The problem can be reproduced from supplied tests, i.e: tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests:test_graph_tfadd.
Environment
OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.4
Tensorflow source: v1.1.0-rc2
Bazel: bazel release 0.4.5-homebrew
Describe the problem
The generated object file from the graph seems to be invalid or is not recognized by libtool:
libtool: file: bazel-out/local-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests/test_graph_tfadd.o is not an object file (not allowed in a library)
file bazel-out/local-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests/test_graph_tfadd.o bazel-out/local-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests/test_graph_tfadd.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
How to reproduce the problem
The problem can be reproduced on a fresh checkout issuing the following commands:
bazel build //tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests:test_graph_tfadd
If you need more information, I am happy to provide it!
