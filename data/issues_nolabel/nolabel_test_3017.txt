how to generate image_ops.h with makefile?

As TensorFlow v0.9.0 RC0 add makefile for better cross-platform build support (C API only), i try to compile Image Recognition with makefile (which is compiled with bazel originally). However, it raise error that
image_ops.h: No such file...

And I cannot find image_ops.h in tensorflow/cc/ops/. But when I compile it with Bazel, the error is gone.
what you have tried?

I analysed tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl and BUILD files related and found that image_ops.h(or many others) was generated by tensorflow/cc/ops/cc_op_gen.cc automatically.
I found files which generated bytensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen_file_lists.sh didn't contain cc_ops_gen.cc etc. Is it not supported yet with makefile?

My Questions:

how to generate image_ops.h with makefile so as to compile Image Recongnition successfully.
Has image_ops any other lib dependencies?
