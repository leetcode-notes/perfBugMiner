tensorflow/tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py TypeError

when running ptb_word_lm.py:
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 259, in main
config = get_config()
File "ptb_word_lm.py", line 122, in init
self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'int'
I replaced
self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
to
self._cost = cost = tf.div(tf.reduce_sum(loss), batch_size)
and it seems to work fine.
