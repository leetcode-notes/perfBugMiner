Possible typo in doc of constant_initializer

In the doc of constant_initializer, it says that the argument value should be:

value: A Python scalar. All elements of the initialized variable will be set to this value.

But in fact, it can take array-like argument and initialize variables properly with it. So I guess it's a mistake in the doc? It's kind of misleading for beginners.
Thanks!
