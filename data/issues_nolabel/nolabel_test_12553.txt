Object detection evaluation warning

Hi,
Here is my system details:

macOS10
no GPU
python3.6
tensorflow1.3
installed tf from source

I'm running the evaluation of object detection, but every time I run into this warning:
WARNING:root:The following classes have no ground truth examples: 0
/Users/Mohamad/Projects/Python/tensorflow/models/object_detection/utils/metrics.py:145: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide
  num_images_correctly_detected_per_class / num_gt_imgs_per_class)

I want to know how to solve this warning? Is it something serious?
Thanks.
