Fix of issue #13164

Fixes #13164.
tf.gather and tf.gather_nd now support int32 and int64 ref tensors when running on GPU.
tf.scatter_nd now supports int32 ref tensors when running on GPU. int64 is not supported as some CudaAtomic operations are not supported.
The tests have been updated.
The fix was not tested with SYCL.
