Remove all {#anchor} tags in non-API Markdown docs

This commit does two things:

Removes all '{#anchor}' syntax from Markdown header lines in the codebase
Replaces all links that used those #anchors with links conforming to
Github/Tensorflow website auto-generated anchors

The work is a continuation on #648.
This commit does not change the API docs, as those Markdown files are
auto-generated.
Generated using Python script available here:

Cross-page links changed by hand using this script to find non-api
anchor links:
