[BUG]embedding_lookup can't convert out of index into zeros vector when embedding matrix is placed on CPU

System information

Describe the problem
embedding_lookup can't convert out of index into zeros vector when embedding matrix is placed on CPU.
when the matrix is placed on GPU, embedding_lookup method automatically convert out_of_index components into zeros vector, but it doesn't work when the matrix is placed on CPU
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None, None])
with tf.device('/cpu'):  ### when tf.device('/gpu') it's okay
embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable('embedding_matrix', [5, 2],
dtype=tf.float32,
initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer())
embedded = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix, inputs)
inputs_test = [[1],[2],[10]
]
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
res = sess.run(embedded,feed_dict = {inputs:inputs_test})
print(res)
