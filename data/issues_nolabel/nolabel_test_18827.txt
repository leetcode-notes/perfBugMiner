Describe the problem
From TF 1.8 TFRecordDataset has a new init parameter num_parallel_reads which essentially wraps a ParallelInterleaveDataset around the _TFRecordDataset instance we're reading from.
In the current implementation, the parallel interleave is hardcoded with sloppy=False.
Would it be possible to add sloppy as an additional parameter to TFRecordDataset? That would allow to simplify this:
files = tf.data.list_files('somewhere/*')
dataset = files.apply(tf.data.parallel_interleave(TFRecordDataset, cycle_length=num_parallel_calls, sloppy=True))
to
files = tf.data.list_files('somewhere/*')
dataset = TFRecordDataset(files, num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_calls, sloppy=True)
(Note that the underlying implementations are identical)
