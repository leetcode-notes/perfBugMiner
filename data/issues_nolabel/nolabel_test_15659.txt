Document Bazel-Tensorflow-Cuda interdependencies

Since each version of Tensorflow appears to require some specific release of bazel, it would be helpful to have documentation like this also for people who are stuck on an older version of CUDA. For instance, I cannot upgrade to CUDA 8 on the machine I am using and am now left with the exercise of finding a working config in a space of 5 dimensions (python version, bazel version, tf version, cuda version, cudnn version).
I had it once working with CUDA 7.0 and python 3.5 (and I think bazel 0.3), but cannot reproduce now.
In this concrete case, I am trying to build r0.11 with python 3.6, cuda 7.5, cudnn 6 and bazel 0.3/0.4/0.8 and nothing's working.
