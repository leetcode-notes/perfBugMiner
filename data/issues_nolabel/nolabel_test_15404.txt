DOCS: Update the description of the fused parameter.

Update the description of layers.batch_normalization and contrib.layers.python.layers.batch_norm to reflect the fact that fused=None is equivalent to fused=True. In fact, both functions check at the beginning if fused is None, and if yes they set it to True.
