Reproducing results in tensorflow

Hi All,
I set the graph-level seed and op-level seed to be 0, and run the same script for 10 times. However, for a different run, 5 out of 10 times, the results are exactly the same (weights in the model and the training loss). For the other 5 times, the results are completely different for each run apart from the initialization steps.
Anyone has any idea of what is going on here?
Thanks!
