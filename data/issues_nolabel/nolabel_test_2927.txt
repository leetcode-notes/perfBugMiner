iOS example Retrained Stripped model memory usage causes app to crash without warning

Environment info
Operating System: iOS
Steps to reproduce

create graph with image_retraining example
use strip_unused tool on graph with input_node_names=Mul, output_node_names=final_result
run iOS example with the retrained stripped graph
80% of the time the app crashes, apparently because it allocates too much memory

What have you tried?

reducing the size of the image being processed
