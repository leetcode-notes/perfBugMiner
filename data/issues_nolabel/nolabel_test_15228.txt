Bug in XLA, if branches optimized by grappler/arithmetic_optimizer

grappler/arithmetic_optimizer may merge different Const op with same value into one. However, if two Const ops are in different branches (tf.cond, or SwitchOp, user-defined SwitchOp things), XLA will make them into one cluster, which would cause this XlaLaunchOp can't be run forever.
One way to walk around this is to disable arithmetic_optimizer.
