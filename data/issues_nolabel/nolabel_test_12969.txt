All tf.sets.* ops fail to reproduce their own official examples.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee', '1.3.0')
Python version:  3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce: n/a

Context:
tf.sets.* ops documentation declares that: 'All but the last dimension of a and b must match.'.
Also, the example is provided:
a = [
    [
      [
        [1, 2],
        [3],
      ],
      [
        [4],
        [5, 6],
      ],
    ],
  ]
  b = [
    [
      [
        [1, 3],
        [2],
      ],
      [
        [4, 5],
        [5, 6, 7, 8],
      ],
    ],
  ]
tf.sets.set_intersection(a, b)
tf.sets. set_union(a, b)
tf.sets.set_size(a)
tf.sets.set_difference(a, b, aminusb=True)

Problem:
When using tf.sets.* ops, the following error occurs:
ValueError: Argument must be a dense tensor: [[[[1, 2], [3]], [[4], [5, 6]]]] - got shape [1, 2, 2], but wanted [1, 2, 2, 2].

From this error it is deducible, that a dense tensor is needed. This statement contradicts the description of methods. Also, logically we would not want to have a dense tensor or any kind of padding in sets (this leads to excessive padding elements in sets - which defies the purpose).
Statement:
Either the functionality or the description of tf.sets must be fixed.
