TF_OperationOpType

Hi,
TF_Node has been renamed to TF_Operation, which involved changing the names of a lot of functions. In particular, TF_NodeOpType has been changed to TF_OperationOpType. Before itâ€™s been released, I just want to confirm that Op in TF_OperationOpType is not redundant. Thanks!
Regards,
Ivan
