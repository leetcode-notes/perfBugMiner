QuantConv2D

Hi, I've followed the documentation and TF Github code and couldn't find the relation between QuantizedConv2D to GEMMlowp. Does QuantizedConv2D use, implicitly, in a way the QuantizedMatMul(quantized_matmul_op.cc), under the hood, where the latter calls GemmlowpMultiply explicitly? Otherwise how the QuantizedConv2D using the great benefit of google GEMM HW platform specific implementation?
