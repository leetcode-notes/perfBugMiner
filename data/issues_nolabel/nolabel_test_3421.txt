Scope Reusability in tf.nn.dynamic_rnn

I am getting this error when I try to run the code for RNN:
ValueError: Variable RNN/MultiRNNCell/Cell0/BasicLSTMCell/Linear/Matrix does not exist, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
Here is a snippet of my code for RNN:
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(self._num_hidden, forget_bias=0.0)
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([lstm_cell] * self._num_layers)
self._initial_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
inputs=[tf.reshape(data_,[batch_size,num_cat]) for data_ in tf.split(0,max_length,tf.transpose(data,[1,0,2]))]
output,_=tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell,inputs,initial_state=self._initial_state,sequence_length=self.length)
The error seems to be in line:
output,_=tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell,inputs,initial_state=self._initial_state,sequence_length=self.length)
My input is a tensor with dimensions : batch_size x max_ seq_length x feature_vector_size
I am reshaping it to a list of dimensions : batch_size x feature_vector_size
I am assuming that the reusability of scope is handled internally by tf.nn.dynamic_rnn function. Any idea why this would happen? What could be the solution?
