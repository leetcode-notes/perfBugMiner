Using a `tf.Tensor` as a Python `bool` is not allowed

import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1,2,3])
b = tf.equal(a, 0)

with tf.Session() as ss:
    print(ss.run(a,b))

When I run the code above, I encounter the following errors:

TypeError: Using a tf.Tensor as a Python bool is not allowed. Use if t is not None: instead of if t: to test if a tensor is defined, and use TensorFlow ops such as tf.cond to execute subgraphs conditioned on the value of a tensor.

But when I change to the following code, it doesn't raise a exception
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1,2,3])
b = tf.equal(a, 0)

with tf.Session() as ss:
    print(ss.run(a))
    print(ss.run(b))

with the output of

[1 2 3]
[False False False]

It seems to be a bug, or it's designed to be so?
