ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow' on windows + anaconda

I followed the instructions on downloading and setting up tensorflow on windows. they result in one red line on the pip installation and the no-module-found error message in python interactive.
steps:

install anaconda for windows 64bit for python 3.5 as per given link in the tensorflow install page
issue a pip for tensorflow (either one of these would result in the samething):
C:> pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
or
C:> pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

the pip installation ends with a line printed in red:
"Cannot remove entries from nonexistent file c:\users\jesaremi\appdata\local\continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\easy-install.pth"

open up python and type "import tensorflow as tf":




import tensorflow as tf
