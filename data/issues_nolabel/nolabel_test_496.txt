tensorflow/core/user_kernels needed

correct me if I am wrong, but I believe a subdir of tensorflow/core/user_kernels is needed to support user written GPU kernels (CPU is fine), this is due to the build rules in tensorflow/core/BUILD when building the user_ops_op_lib is a cc_library rather than say tf_cuda_library.
