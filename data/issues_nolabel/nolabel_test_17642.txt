Fix unaligned access on Android 4 or 5

This issue is caused by a breaking change in NDK clang (r13+). In those
recent NDKs, clang assumes NEON vectors are aligned to 128-bit boundary,
and thus generates 128-bit address hints. However, on old Android
versions, heap-allocated memory are not always aligned to 128-bit.
After consulting NDK maintainers (here), the breaking change of compiler will not be fixed - so TensorFlow should fix it instead.
P.S: it also seems to be responsible for #16317 .
Secondly, it looks to me that existing code (here) allocates more than it actually needs. The element count should not be multiplied by sizeof(float32x4_t) again. Please help verify this part.
