docs error in triplet_semihard_loss()

Since ||AP|| + alpha < ||AN||, I think the docs in the following
def triplet_semihard_loss(labels, embeddings, margin=1.0):
"""Computes the triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining.
The loss encourages the positive distances (between a pair of embeddings with
the same labels) to be smaller than the minimum negative distance among
which are at least greater than the positive distance plus the margin constant
(called semi-hard negative) in the mini-batch. If no such negative exists,
uses the largest negative distance instead.
should be
