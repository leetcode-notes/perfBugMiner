iPython Tensorflow import error

I am trying to install Tensorflow GPU on a different environment than my original anaconda root. So I followed the instruction on the website, installed CUDA 8, cuDNN 5.1, and tensorflow on a new Tensorflow environment.

PS: The same happens when I tried to install the simple tensorflow on my original root environment, works on python but not on ipython.
Any suggestions please? Thank you.
