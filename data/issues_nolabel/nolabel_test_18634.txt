`tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer` is not consistent with `tf.variance_scaling_initializer`?

I found the implementation of tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer is not consistent with implementation of tf.variance_scaling_initializer?
In https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.7/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/initializers.py#L148, the trunc_stddev is multiplied by 1.3.
While in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.7/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py#L466, there is no 1.3.
So, which is correct?
