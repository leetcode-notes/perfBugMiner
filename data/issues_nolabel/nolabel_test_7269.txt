Simplify cuDNN library handling in configure script.

cuda_configure.bzl now handles the more complicated operations.
Also, we were running into bugs with failure to handle filenames "cudnn.dylib" and "cudnn.5.dylib"
cuda_configure can do that without any issues.
Also locally verified that local_config_cuda repository references libcudnn with version string in the name, thus rendering the removed code redundant.
