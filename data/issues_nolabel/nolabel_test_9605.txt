Add check for duplicate names in import_graph_def

Found when working on #8999. Currently, import_graph_def naively goes through all the Ops in the GraphDef without asserting that all names are unique. This causes bugs when it loops through the ops a second time in order to update their input values, as the input values for one op may be assigned to another op.
Generally, people don't need to worry about unique names, as TensorFlow provides that functionality automatically. However, this will be a useful debugging check to have for tools that modify GraphDefs directly (such as the quantize_graph tool).
