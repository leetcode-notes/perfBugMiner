Environment Variable KERB_TICKET_CACHE_PATH is unnecessary

83559ee have provided a commit to add kerberos ticket cache file.
In com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule#initialize(), it default set ticketCacheName from ticketCache of options, ticketCache was set in org.apache.hadoop.security.HadoopConfiguration by System.getenv("KRB5CCNAME");.
So, according to https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/hadoop, set ticket cache by KRB5CCNAME instead of KERB_TICKET_CACHE_PATH, the program still working properly.
Therefore, 83559ee is unnecessary, just remind users set KRB5CCNAME in https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/hadoop
