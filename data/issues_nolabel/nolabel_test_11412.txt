WAV encoding/decoding fixes.

Hi,
This PR contains two WAV related fixes.
Fixes WAV encoding/decoding for multi-channel data:

DecodeLin16WaveAsFloatVector was failing for multi-channel data with “Bad bytes per second” due to it expecting the byte rate to be that for a single channel, whereas the header specifies the byte rate for all channels.
EncodeAudioAsS16LEWav was incorrectly encoding the byte rate as that for a single channel instead of for all channels.

Fixes shape function for the DecodeWav op:

The function was returning a non-ok status when either desired_{samples,channels} attributes were default; now, we use the unknown-dim instead.

Cheers.
