Matplotlib incompatibility when using virtualenv

RuntimeError when importing matplotlib.pyplot in a jupyter notebook from a virtual environment:
RuntimeError: Python is not installed as a framework. The Mac OS X backend will not be able to function correctly if Python is not installed as a framework. See the Python documentation for more information on installing Python as a framework on Mac OS X. Please either reinstall Python as a framework, or try one of the other backends. If you are Working with Matplotlib in a virtual enviroment see 'Working with Matplotlib in Virtual environments' in the Matplotlib FAQ
I have solved the problem using one of the solutions mentioned at: Matplotlib VirtualEnv FAQ and that is ok when using python from the command line or a script file, but not with the kernel used in jupyter.
So, the question is: how to create a jupyter kernel that uses a specific bash which properly setups python to use matplotlib within a virtual environment.
Another solution is:
import matplotlib  
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')   
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

But maybe that is not the best thing to do. So, any suggestions?.
