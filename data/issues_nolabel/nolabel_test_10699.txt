RDMA transport should support variable sized tensor

RDMA transport disabled variable size tensor https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/verbs/rdma.cc#L738 and https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/verbs/rdma.cc#L759.
However, in the embedding lookup model, the tensor has variable size. It's a common model parallelism case.
