Fix code block rendering issue in adding_an_op.md

In adding_an_op.md, html <code> was used in markdown for code blocks. However, this does not work very well as some of the code blocks includes incorrect rendering.
This fix converts html into "```c++" (backticks) so that the rendering could be fixed.
