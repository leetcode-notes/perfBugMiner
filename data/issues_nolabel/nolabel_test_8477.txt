No scalars and images show up in tensorboard

I'm trying to get some visualization on tensorboard, the graph is shown up, but scalars and images are not. I also tried the mnist demo code, still the same problem.
My colleagues could see the visualization from tensorboard on their machines, so the event/data itself has no problem.
Anyone has any clue?
I have checked this thread: #1421, and tried everything suggested. I do have css file under /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/lib/css/
Environment info
Operating System: Linux Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:  CUDA 8, cuDNN 5
pip installed tensorflow 0.12.1
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried different browser, chrome and firefox got the same results, no images and sclars show up.
I tried on other machines with same enviorment settings, and had no problem.
