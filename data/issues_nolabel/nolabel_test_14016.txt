CMake-Linux support for GPU-build

There had been some fixes for Linux

Enable to specify or find related libraries (cuda/cudnn)
Enable "find_package(CUDA)"
Address the Linux Cmake-parser issue with TF_EXTRA_CUDA_CAPABILITIES=3.0,3.5,5.2
Improve the method to find static libraries
Enable tf_stream_executor for Linux-CMake build by linking to "libgomp"
Adjust pywarp_tensorflow_lib configuration
Hide build option not recognized at Linux toolchains
Add resampler cu.cc files
Don't use tf_core_kernels_cpu_only for Linux (it's for Windows only)

Tested with OBS (open build service) + rpmbuild for bare-metal (minimal packages are installed) x64 Linux.
