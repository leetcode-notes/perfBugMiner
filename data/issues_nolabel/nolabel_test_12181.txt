System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
NO


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Debian 8.4


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):


Trying to compile it from source.


TensorFlow version (use command below):
latest git head


Python version:
2.7.10


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
5.2


CUDA/cuDNN version:
various, tried CUDA 8.0, 7.5, 7.0 and cuDNN 4.0, 5.0, 5.1


Exact command to reproduce:
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git tensorflow-1.3.0
./configure
WARNING: Running Bazel server needs to be killed, because the startup options are different.
You have bazel 0.5.2- (@non-git) installed.
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /software/python/2.7.10/intel/bin/python]:

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with jemalloc as malloc support? [Y/n]:
jemalloc as malloc support will be enabled for TensorFlow.


Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N]:
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [y/N]:
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]:
No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GDR support? [y/N]:
No GDR support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with VERBS support? [y/N]:
No VERBS support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL support? [y/N]:
No OpenCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 8.0]: 8.0
Please specify the location where CUDA 8.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: /software/cuda/8.0
"Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]: 5
Please specify the location where cuDNN 5 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /software/cuda/8.0]:/software/cudnn/5.1
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size. [Default is: 3.5,5.2]2.0,3.5
Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]:
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.
Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]:
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]:
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]:
Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the environment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.
Configuration finished
bazel build --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
