Enable building with CUDA support on Mac OS X

building with CUDA support on OS X requires GNU coreutils due to the OS X
native readlink command behaving differently from the GNU version - you can
install it using homebrew: "brew install coreutils"
OS X CUDA builds against CUDA toolkit v. 7.5 to overcome host compiler
incompatibility - the toolkit versions (CUDA & cuDNN) are now controlled by
variables set in the configure script
cuda/platform.bzl file is dynamically generated by the configure script to
overcome bazel limitations for using "select" to set the platform
specific names and paths of CUDA libraries
SE_STATIC_THREAD_LOCAL_POD now uses __thread instead of thread_local which
is not yet supported by the version of clang shipped by Apple. __thread
supports only primitive types, but is more performant
Updates Eigen to a newer version that fixes a (clang) compilation error
