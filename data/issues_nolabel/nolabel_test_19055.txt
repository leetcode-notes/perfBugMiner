Feature: Add reduce_average (weighted reduce_mean)

Add tf.reduce_average according to issue #7422
In this issue, some people doubt why this function is needed. I think broadcasting weights and corresponding axis is complex enough and worth a built-in function.
np.average is also contributed by me. Related Issue and PR.
I add support for any case where len(axis) == rank(weights),  and it's the same in tf.reduce_average to keep compatibility with numpy.
A unit test is attached.
