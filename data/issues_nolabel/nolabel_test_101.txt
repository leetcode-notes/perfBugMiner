Neural Translation Model example fails due to missing EN tokens

The S2S Neural Translation example (tensorflow/models/rnn/translate)  runs into this error:

tensorflow.python.platform.default._gfile.FileError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/giga-fren.release2.ids40000.en'

The issue seems to be in prepare_wmt_data of data_utils.py. Here, instead of creating a new file for the EN tokens, the FR tokens are overwritten by EN tokens:

data_to_token_ids(train_path + ".en", fr_train_ids_path, fr_vocab_path)

The fix seems to be as simple as changing that line to:

data_to_token_ids(train_path + ".en", en_train_ids_path, en_vocab_path)
