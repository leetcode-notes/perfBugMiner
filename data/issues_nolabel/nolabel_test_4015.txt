Consider that arg keep_prob to dropout might be an int

Calling
tf.nn.dropout(layer, dropout=0.0)

raises a ValueError, as expected. However, since the condition for the ValueError reads as
if isinstance(keep_prob, float) and not 0 < keep_prob <= 1:
    raise ValueError(...)

a call like this succeeds:
tf.nn.dropout(layer, dropout=0)

This problem occurs whenever an int is passed that is not 1 (the only allowed int value). This PR contains a simple workaround by considering that the argument might be an int.
