Generating whl for linux

Hi all,
I am trying to compile tensorflow for ubuntu 14.04 by following instruction at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#create-pip.
Made it as far as:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
with correct output.  The instructions seems to stop there without any indication of how to generate whl for pip and further how to install with pip.  Any pointers will be appreciated.
Thanks
LEon
