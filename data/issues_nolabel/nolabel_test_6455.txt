gradient for tf.gather_nd

I use tf.gather_nd to build a Value Iteration Block(NIPS2016 best paper, value iteration network).
I need to pick several "pixels" (what the input (i,j) points to in the following picture) in the feature map Q_n.

But I got this error: NotImplementedError: Gradient for gather_nd is not implemented.
I know gradient for tf.gather is implemented, but tf.gather could only slice the first dimentsion. It should be easy to transfer the gradient of tf.gather to tf.gather_nd.
Or anyone could tell me how to implement this operation and train this?
