Attention Decoder

Hi,
@ebrevdo Eugene speaks here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIR_-Xlbp7s (29:50) about a class AttentionDecoder and says it's under development (as of Tensorflow Summit date), however I can't find this class anywhere in the master/r1.1/r1.0 tensorflow code. Do you know when it will be added?
