error while loading shared libraries: __vdso_time: invalid mode for dlopen():Invalid argument

sorry to trouble you. I use Centos6.4 and CUDA7.0 and I have no ‘sudo’ authority. I install tensorflow from the source. After I installed glib2.17 and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, I encountered the same error many people got:
error while loading shared libraries: __vdso_time: invalid mode for dlopen():Invalid argument
I try to search many solutions and there is still not a good or detailed solution. Can you give some detailed instructions. I think it will help many people.
Thankyou very much in advance!
