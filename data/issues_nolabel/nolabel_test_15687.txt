How to load a metagraph via C++

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2
Python version: 2.7

Describe the problem
I want to load a metagraph via C++ code, and later the checkpoint weights. To load the metagraph, I first generate a pb file from it
with tf.Session() as sess:
	new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(root_dir + meta_graph)
	tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, root_dir, export_pb, as_text=False)

Then I use selective registration to generate the ops and kernels needed
bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header --graphs=xinmei/rnn_dict/model_test.pb > tensorflow/core/framework/ops_to_register.h
Next, I compile my runnable using this registration. However, when I run the executable on my Android device, it says
Error creating graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Const' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
  <no registered kernels>

	 [[Node: save/RestoreV2_8/shape_and_slices = Const[_output_shapes=[[1]], dtype=DT_STRING, value=Tensor<type: string shape: [1] values: >]()]]

How can I load the metagraph? The motivation of this is that I want to continue training the model on my Android device.
