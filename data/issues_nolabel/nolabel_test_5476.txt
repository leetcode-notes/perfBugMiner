CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM in version 0.11.0rc1

NOTE: Only file GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests.  All other topics will be closed.
Following steps i did:

Install tensorflow
Execute the source example to make sure everything is fine
Run srcnn.py in  https://github.com/liliumao/Tensorflow-srcnn/blob/master/srcnn.py

Then I encounter the error message
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:444] could not set cudnn tensor descriptor: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM
What is more strange is that the program did trained 160 times and then show the error message.
And it only happens after iteration 160 times.

Environment info
Operating System : CentOS 7.2.1511+ tensorflow 0.11.0rc1
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 8.0 & cuDNN 5.1
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
0.11.0rc1

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
https://github.com/liliumao/Tensorflow-srcnn/blob/master/srcnn.py
What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Transfer the cuda version to 7.5, however the tf.0.11.0rc1 needs cuda 8.0.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
