I implemented Multiplicative Integration variants of recurrent neural networks
(RNN, GRU and LSTM) proposed in
Yuhuai Wu, Saizheng Zhang, Ying Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
On Multiplicative Integration with Recurrent Neural Networks. NIPS, 2016.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06630
The RNNs proposed in the paper are implemented as:
MultiplicativeIntegrationRNNCell
MultiplicativeIntegrationGRUCell
MultiplicativeIntegrationLSTMCell
_multiplicative_integration as a helper function
