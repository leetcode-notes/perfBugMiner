r1.3 fix Bazel 0.5.3 build error

This is the patch necessary for TensorFlow r1.3 to compile with Bazel 0.5.3, which is set to be merged before the 1.3 release.
@martinwicke Mentioned in #11949 (comment) from which this change is cherry picked:

@av8ramit is this on the 1.3 branch? If not, can you cherry-pick it? It's build only so no need for another RC because of this.

I can confirm it isn't on the 1.3 branch. I'm building on Bazel 0.5.3, and I can also confirm that the r1.3 build works locally on my Ubuntu 16.04 once this patch is added, but does not work without it.
