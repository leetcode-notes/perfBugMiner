Won't build with latest version of ComputeCpp

I was just supposed to install Keras. But it failed on building Tensorflow.
The command I ran is 'bazel build --local_resources 2048,.5,1.0 -c opt --config=sycl //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package', as in https://www.codeplay.com/portal/03-30-17-setting-up-tensorflow-with-opencl-using-sycl .

From source. Git master version. ec2c663 commit.
Package: python3
Version: 3.5.1-3
Package: bazel
Version: 0.12.0
gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9)
No CUDA, because I have RX 550 with working OpenCL
amdgpu-pro-17.40.2712-510357 driver, because latest wasn't working

The problem is 'error: no template named 'map_allocator' in namespace 'cl::sycl''.
It also constantly appears while running testsuite.
Forgot to mention - it is said that I need ComputeCpp 1.2. But minimum version on their site is 0.2.0, and I'm using 0.7.0. That might be the problem, however I don't know which version is supported at the moment.
