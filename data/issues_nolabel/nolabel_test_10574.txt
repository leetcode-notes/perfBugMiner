Changed default `evalution_master` to also use cluster information

When using the standard Estimator during evaluation in distributed setting (a cluster_spec was supplied) I encountered the following error message:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device for operation 
'save/RestoreV2_28': Operation was explicitly assigned to 
/job:ps/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 but available devices are
[ /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0, /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0 ]. 
Make sure the device specification refers to a valid device.

[[Node: save/RestoreV2_28 = RestoreV2[dtypes=[DT_FLOAT], 
_device="/job:ps/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](save/Const, save/RestoreV2_28/tensor_names, 
save/ResyoreV2_28/shape_and_slices)]]

In short:
The evaluation graph is looking for Variables on /job:localhost but they are on /job:ps, as is intended.
To fix this I changed the default settings of placing the evaluation_master on localhost to the same as for master. This means that when instancing a RunConfig with no evaluation_master given it will check if there is a cluster_spec. If so it will get the evaluation_master based on the cluster_spec.
This fixes the problem for me and leads to correct behaviour.
