Compilation fails with --config=sycl due to missing comma in tensorflow/core/kernels/training_ops.cc

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 17.10

Describe the problem
Bug in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/training_ops.cc
in line 2551 resulting from a missing comma. Instead of
ctx, 0, use_exclusive_lock_, false & var));
it should read
ctx, 0, use_exclusive_lock_, false, &var));
Source code / logs
When compiling with opencl enabled (--config=sycl) the bazel build command will result in an error.
