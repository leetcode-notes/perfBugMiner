Document functional differences between tf.stack and tf.parallel_stack

What if tf.stack had the API:
tf.stack(
    values,
    axis=0,
    name='stack',
    algorithm='sequential'
)

Options for algorithm could be sequential, parallel to start. This could apply broadly to many ops and ops like parallel_stack could be deprecated.
Any ideas for a better parameter name than algorithm?
