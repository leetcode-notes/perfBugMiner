tf_env_collect.sh script is not working well in Mac OS

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS 10.12
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): (binary) pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tensorflow (1.1.0)
tensorflow-gpu (1.0.1)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5-homebrew
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.0
GPU model and memory: AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
This script to extract the environment is not working well in my Mac. ( MacOS 10.12 )
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
I think we should replace &>> into >> in the script.
There are 4 &>> in this script.
c++ --version &>> $OUTPUT_FILE

c++ --version >> $OUTPUT_FILE

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Let me show my results.

Wrote environment to tf_env.txt. You can review the contents of that file.
