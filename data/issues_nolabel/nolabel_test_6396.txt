Cmake static library build issue

Hi all,
I have successfully build tensorflow in windows/visual studio using the cmake project.
Now due to large build time of tensorflow, I am building the tensorflow as libraries (static library) and trying to use them in an application (tf_label_image_example). However, I get the following runtime error at the points of calling env constructor in the SessionOptions at the following source code:
session->reset(tensorflow::NewSession(tensorflow::SessionOptions()));.
Error is: No session factory registered for the given session options: {target: "" config: } Registered factories are {}.
It is similar to this error in makefiles and MAC os where the compiler is stripping the multiple defined symbols. I tried to add visual studio equivalent of this compiler options (/FORCE:MULTIPLE and /WHOLEARCHIVE) to build of tf_core_lib.lib . however, the compiler options are not applicable to static libraries. Alternative option to is make a DLL, however, that would require modification of all functions with __declspec(dllexport).
Is there a better solution?
The tf_label_image_example application contains main.cc and the following additional lib dependencies:
tf_core_cpu.lib
tf_core_framework.lib
tf_core_kernels.lib
tf_cc_framework.lib
tf_cc_ops.lib
tf_core_ops.lib
tf_stream_executor.lib
tf_core_direct_session.lib
tf_core_lib.lib
Thanks in advance.
