no such package 'tensorflow/examples/image_retraining': BUILD file not found on package path

System information

I have not written any of my own code. I downloaded Tensorflow through virtualenv as recommended by tensorflow
My OS is High Sierra on a macbook pro
: I am using python 2.7
**Bazel version Build label: 0.7.0-homebrew:

I'm following the tensorflow tutorial on how to retrain inception v3, which I have linked here; https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining
When I input the bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain  it says there is no build file. How do i get the build file. Im new to tensorflow so if you could put the code in here that would be extremely helpful because I am new to coding and new to github itself
