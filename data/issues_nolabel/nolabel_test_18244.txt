Python3 support of docs generation

This is a resubmit of pr #16817, by @ppwwyyxx.
(I accidentally squashed the original PR with a bad push command)
These changes:

Switch the docs generator to use astor instead of codegen (since astor is now a tensorflow
prerequesite, and codegen is not py3 compatible).
update tf_inspect to emulate the behavior of py3's inspect.getfullargspec in py2, so that the
behavior is consistent.
