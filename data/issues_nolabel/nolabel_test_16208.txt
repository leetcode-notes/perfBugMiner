using string_input_producer with train dataset and validate dataset

I have two datasets(files), for train and validate respectively. I can successfully load training set thru tf.train.string_input_producer, set num_epochs=5. Then I can iteratively get batch of data to optimize my model.
But, I got stuck when trying to load my validation set by the same way, the program keeps saying "OutOfRange Error" even I didn't set num_epochs in string_input_producer.
Can you supply an example that using string_input_producer  with two or more dataset?
same as the question on stackoverflow: here
Please help me solve the problem. Thank you very much.
