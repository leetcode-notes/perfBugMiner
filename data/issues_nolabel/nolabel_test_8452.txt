Addresses #6682.  Tensordot now correctly infers partial shapes when possible.  In some cases, such inference is still impossible, such as when axes are specified as a tensor or when either of the operand tensors has an unknown number of dimensions.
The tests for tensordot were updated as well in order to test the new behavior
