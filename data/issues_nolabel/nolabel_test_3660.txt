cannot run on x86 emulator android example

Linux Sabayon 4.3 on intel x86_64 platform

cannot build and run an apk for x86_64 cpu android emulator.
bazel release 0.3.1-2016-08-02 (@8b4df1b)

I run this command in order to build the apk package that I would like to run on x86_64 emulator
bazel build --android_cpu=x86_64 //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
But in
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/android/_dx/tensorflow_demo/native_symlinks/MANIFEST
I
still see a link to an arm library...
I've  built the library for x86_64 with this
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_native_libs --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=x86_64 --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain
I thought that specifying --android_cpu=x86_64 was enough to link the apk towards x86_64 native library
Kind regards.
