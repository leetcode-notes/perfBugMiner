tensorflow:nightly-devel-gpu is broken

Commit "Fix nightly docker builds" broke the nightly builds :)
$ nvidia-docker run --rm -ti tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-devel-gpu nvidia-smi
NVIDIA-SMI couldn't find libnvidia-ml.so library in your system. Please make sure that the NVIDIA Display Driver is properly installed and present in your system.
Please also try adding directory that contains libnvidia-ml.so to your system PATH.

You shouldn't override the existing value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, we use it to point to the path where we mount the driver libraries mounted by nvidia-docker, see here
