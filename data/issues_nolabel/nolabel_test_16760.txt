Feature request: Adding data_format argument to lstm2d.separable_lstm

Since ndlstm is used for 2D data such as images, I think it would be nice to include a data_format argument in lstm2d.separable_lstm in case one decides to use the channels first format (NCHW) for their images (i.e. Using CNN having NCHW data format followed by NDLSTM).
