Plots in tensorboard overlay when change horizontal axis

Problem
When using tensorboard, if the axis is changed from 'step' to 'relative' and back to 'step' quickly a new graph is created and overlays the original one.  This looks confusing as in the images below.  Note that the issue can be cleared by refreshing the page.
Small graph, both of the graphs shown here have an extra graph overlayed.

If the graph is expanded, the old graph stays small and the new graph is enlarged showing the double graph issue more clearly.

Environment info
Operating System: Fedora release 23
Tensorflow Version: 0.7.1
Steps to reproduce

Run tensorboard from a directory with some tensorflow summary files.
Open tensorboard in on the 'Events' page.
Quickly change the 'Horizontal Axis' from 'Step' to 'Relative' and back to 'Step' (ie. all within < 1 second)
Graphs are now reproduced as described above.

Workaround
Just refresh the page if you accidentally do this.
Would be worth fixing if somebody is aware of the code responsible and it's an easy enough fix.
