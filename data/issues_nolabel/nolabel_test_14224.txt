tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.0-devel-gpu uses libcuda.so stub at runtime

$ nvidia-docker run -ti tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.0-devel-gpu /bin/bash
root@2ad65cce2269:~# ldd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so

        libcuda.so.1 => /usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs/libcuda.so.1 (0x00007f9de7215000)

As a result, you can't use CUDA in this image:
