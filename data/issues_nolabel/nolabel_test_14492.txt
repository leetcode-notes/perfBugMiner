Add a mutex in cuda_solvers GetrfImpl.

This should solve issue #13558. Because NVIDIA does not publish the code, it is not possible to prove
the bug is in the cuSolver function. However, I have removed / commented code from
matrix_inverse_op.cpp until essentially only the call to solver->Getrf remained, and from @yaroslavvb'
project mostly everything except the regularized_inverse calls, and the segmentation fault still
occurred. It did not appear when there was a single thread calling regularized_inverse. The segmentation fault always occurs without my change, and never after introducing the
lock (although that in itself does not mean the bug is solved).
Note that GetrsImpl is already protected with a lock, so apparently this issue was known.
Finally, @yaroslavvb has a second stacktrace which does not involve the Getrf function.
I could not reproduce this error, but it may be a different bug.
