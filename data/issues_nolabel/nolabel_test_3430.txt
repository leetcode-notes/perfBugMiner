Ignoring gpu device with Cuda multiprocessor count: 7.

I am unable to run TF on a GPU, despite the fact that I have 2 CUDA-enabled K4200 NVIDIA QUATTRO (Compute Capability 3.0)
Environment info
Operating System: linux 14.04 x64
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:

CUDA 7.5
cuDNN 4

If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, GPU enabled, Python 2.7
TF v0.9.0

Steps to reproduce

Run IPython Notebook
Run a tensorflow session (I was doing Udacity DL course)
In IPython log, observe:

What have you tried?

Setting TF_MIN_GPU_MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT to 4, both locally and system-wide

Logs or other output that would be helpful
echo $TF_MIN_GPU_MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT
4
Am I missing something? Setting the environment variable seems to have no effect.
