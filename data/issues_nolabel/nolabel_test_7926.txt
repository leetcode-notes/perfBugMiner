Freeze graph erroring out claiming there are uninitialized values in embeddings

This is similar to #7172 but with my own model.
I'm training a CNN with word embeddings and for some reason I'm getting FailedPreconditionError exception whenever I try to save a frozen version of the model for later use.
This is despite the fact that I call sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) just before training and I have no problem monitoring the training in tensorboard and checkpointing the model at regular intervals.
The problem occurs when I try to load a model from a checkpoint and save a frozen model. The function I'm using is as follows:
def freeze_model(checkpoint_path, model_save_path, output_node_names):
    checkpoint = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(checkpoint_path)
    input_checkpoint = checkpoint.model_checkpoint_path

    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(input_checkpoint + '.meta', clear_devices=True)
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    input_graph_def = graph.as_graph_def()
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        saver.restore(sess, input_checkpoint)

        output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
            sess,
            input_graph_def,
            output_node_names
        )

        with tf.gfile.GFile(model_save_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())
The error that I'm getting is as follows. It looks like the problem is with two embeddings coefficients. If I set clear_devices=False, I get the same error but for only one embedding coefficient:

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I am assigning the embeddings pretrained word2vec values after initializing. I have tried running the model without assigning these values and I get the same error.
I have tried running the training for 70K batches.
I have tried running tf.report_uninitialized_variables after calling tf.global_variables_initializer() and it has come up empty.
