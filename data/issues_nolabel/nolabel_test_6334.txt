Offering a small TensorFlow runtime for production environments

I noticed in #1109 that some attempts to reduce the PyPI package have been made,  but since 0.9 the package has grown quite a bit.
Are there any ongoing attempts of creating a smaller TensorFlow runtime that can be used for putting graphs into production? For example, the most common use case for TensorFlow is probably running a machine learning model's forward pass. For that, all of the gradient related code could be excluded from the package, no?
Preferably I'd love a utility that takes in a graph protobuf and spits out a pip installable TensorFlow version with only the required parts of the codebase. Is this at all doable?
