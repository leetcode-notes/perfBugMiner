Installation exception in EI Capitan

I just installed homebrew, and also set brew python as default.
when I import tensorflow:
Python 2.7.11 (default, Dec 13 2015, 19:34:28)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76)] on darwin

>>> import tensorflow as tf

Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.```

what is the problem?
I can't find the solution anywhere
