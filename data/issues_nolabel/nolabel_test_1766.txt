Multi-dimensional argmax and one-hot

This is a feature request, unless someone can show me how the following might be done with the current API.
Say I have a tensor WxHxD, and I want to keep only the largest element in each WxH slice, setting the rest to zero. These indices could be obtained in numpy by doing something like
(row,col) = np.unravel_index(A.argmax(), A.shape)
on each slice WxH slice A.
Collecting the D row and column indices, I could create a boolean mask using advanced indexing
mask[rows,cols, range(D)] = 1
Then, an elementwise multiplication between the WxHxD tensor and the mask gives the desired tensor.
