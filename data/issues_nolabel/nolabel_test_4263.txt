Update OSS protobuf git depedency version to 3.0.0

from 3.0.0-beta-2
Add a level of indirection to the int64 type in
core/example/feature_util.h, feature_util.cc and the places where the
type is used. This is for dealing with the variability of "int64" type
definition among different platforms. On some systems, int64 is "long
int", while on others it is "long long int". See GitHub Issue for more
details: #3626
