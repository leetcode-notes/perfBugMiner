I can successfully open cupti64_80.dll library. But It seems the program run all the time and will never stop.

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I google for the problem. At first, I can't open "not find cuptiActivityRegisterCallbacksin libcupti DSO", and I adopt the idea from the "menggangmark".
and it can successfully open the cupti64_80 library.
