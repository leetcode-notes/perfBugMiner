Sorry to Reply you.My problem is tensor-flow un-incompatible with windows IIS?

Sorry, i just have time to reply you. Thanks for replying me.
I means I use Flask to call tensor-flow py. And mount Flask to windows IIS. Local run ok. But in IIS will show FastCgi error. Check local run is ok,no error. But when in IIS, when i import keras, it will show fastcgi error. but when don't import keras, it will ok. If tensor-flow isun-incompatible with IIS?
