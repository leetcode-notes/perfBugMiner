tf.count_nonzero should support string tensors

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): N/A
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8
Python version: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: tf.count_nonzero(tf.constant(["test"]))

Describe the problem
tf.count_nonzero should support string tensors, since tf.zeros and tf.zeros_like work with string tensors.
Source code / logs
tf.count_nonzero(tf.constant(["test"]))
