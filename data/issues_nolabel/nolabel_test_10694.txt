Cannot build tensorflow at all

OS/X, building on a branch not master.
After pulling the repo this morning (previous pull 12 hours ago) I can no longer build at all:
ERROR: /Users/davidn/workspace/tensorflowview/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1394:1: no such target '//tensorflow/tools/git:gen/branch_ref': target 'gen/branch_ref' not declared in package 'tensorflow/tools/git' defined by /Users/davidn/workspace/tensorflowview/tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/git/BUILD and referenced by '//tensorflow/core:version_info_gen'.
ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted.
