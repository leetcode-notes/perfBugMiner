[Windows] Fix GetMatchingPaths for use on Windows.

The existing implementation is not compatible with paths containing
backslashes. Use a workaround on Windows only (converting backslashes
to forward slashes).
Also enable several tests in python/training, and fix io_ops_test.py
and saver_test.py to work on Windows.
(saver_test.py and some other tests are disabled until #5634 is merged.)
