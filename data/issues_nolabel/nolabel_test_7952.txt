[Java] Loading frozen graph causes a segfault

I froze then saved a tensorflow graph in python with freeze_graph.py producing a single model.pb file.
However, loading the graph in Java (where modelStream is an InputStream from reading the .pb file):
Graph g = new Graph();
InputStream modelStream = new FileInputStream("/path/to/model.pb");
g.importGraphDef(IOUtils.toByteArray(modelStream);

causes a segfault:
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x0000000125526b1c, pid=6482, tid=7171
#
# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_91-b14) (build 1.8.0_91-b14)

#

The same model.pb file loads and runs properly in Python.
