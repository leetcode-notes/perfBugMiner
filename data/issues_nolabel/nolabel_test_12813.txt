How to add a user_ops to android .so file ?

Discription
I want to add a custom op for tensorflow and use it in android app. But I find it only tell us how to add an op in python . I put my own .cc file witch contains register code into the user_ops folder and bazel build again to generate a new .so file . But when I test this .so in android code, It says the custom op is not registered and crashed. How can I succeed to register a new op and build it into the android .so file?
And I found that there are two folder named "user_ops" : tensorflow/tensorflow/user_ops ; and tensorflow/tensorflow/core/user_ops;  witch folder should I put my ops in ?
Hope for your answer. Thank you so much!
