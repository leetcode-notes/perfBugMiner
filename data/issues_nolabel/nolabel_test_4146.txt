Provide generic android JNI interface

In the Android example, the developer need to write some customized C++ code for the JNI call, this extra effort is not needed especially in the prototyping step.
Could we provide a generic JNI interface (just like generic inference serving, with input/output as a map of tensors, using serialized protobuf bytes or customized serialization), then the developer will not need to write and BUILD C++ code anymore.
Of course, the developers are free to optimize the code by writing the customized JNI calls. This feature will definitely boost the development process.
