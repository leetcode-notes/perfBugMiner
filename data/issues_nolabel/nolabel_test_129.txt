Update docs to instruct to use Bazel 0.1.1 installer

I noticed that the TensorFlow Getting Started doc says to build Bazel 0.1.0 from source. It would be easier for users to use the Bazel installer to install Bazel instead as documented on the Installing Bazel docs. The installers are available on the Bazel releases page.
