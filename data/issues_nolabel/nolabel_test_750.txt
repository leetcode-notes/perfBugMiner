Adding new Ops, how to install it?

Okay I have added a new op as suggested in tutorial, however I can't find instruction to compile it. Will I have to use bazel to add it to the current TensorFlow framework (which already installed in my machine)? Do I have to re-build the whole framework or just the part that I have modified?
