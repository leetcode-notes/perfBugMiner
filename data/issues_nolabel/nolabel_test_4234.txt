Error installing from source.

I'm installing tensorflow from source (git hash 891f8f7, bazel version 0.3.1).
./configure
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

The first two steps work, but the last one gives an error:
error: can't copy 'tensorflow/models/embedding/gen_word2vec.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file

That file indeed does not exist.
