TensorBoard relies on a version of "tsify" which includes an incompatible TypeScript version

The version of "tsify" in the package.json is:
"tsify": "^0.14.8"
but this package includes a 1.x version of typescript. Therefore, compiling certain constructs e.g. "number | null" fails.
This can be (seemingly) resolved by changing the version of tsify to a more recent version not relying on its own TypeScript package.
