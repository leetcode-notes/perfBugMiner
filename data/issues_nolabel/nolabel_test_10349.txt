updated TensorFlow official example: cifar10

I found a problem in the official example: cifar10
It not working in the newest TensorFlow because of API change.
But it's an excellent tutorials for newcomer.
So i updated it and hope more people could see it.
Except API changes,I didn't do any other change.
I hope this tutorials can add to official example again.
