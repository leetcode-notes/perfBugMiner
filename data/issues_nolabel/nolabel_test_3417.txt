Prevent evaluating stale output node.

When quantizing to 8-bit the Identity ops are removed ("spliced"). For graph's with a parameter-less output node like SoftMax, there is no issue. However, if the graph's output node received a constant input (i.e. a bias add with weights) the output node referenced here will be stale (still has Identity input) and result in a error.
