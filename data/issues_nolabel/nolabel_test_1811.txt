Python 3 not installing in virtual environment

Using Tensorflow 0.7.1
I have tried to install the Python 3 version of Tensorflow in a Virtual environment but I think it didn't work since the command
$ python3 -c 'import os; import inspect; import tensorflow; print(os.path.dirname(inspect.getfile(tensorflow)))'
returned
$ /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow
instead of
/home/dlm/tensorflow/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow
I was sure I had activated the tensorflow virtual env before insstaling tensorflow with suport to python 3.
