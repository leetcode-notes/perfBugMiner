[Feature Request] Support grayscale images for classifier on Android

How can one modify ClassifierActivity.java (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/src/org/tensorflow/demo/ClassifierActivity.java) to convert images obtained from the camera to grayscale and then pass them to the inferenceInterface?
Have I written custom code: I want to use the ClassifierActivity with another neural network that was trained on grayscale images
