gradient calc description change it text cell

I have found the previous explanation of manual gradient calculation a
little confusing because we compute a vector of gradients with the size
of number of neurons (with bias) and in the explanation it looks like we
compute a scalar.
Propose more detailed variant if community finds it's better. Excuse me
if  it is convenient to write x_i even for bias unit, just discard this
then.
Attach old and new variant of just last notebook text cell saved to pdf (cannot attach ipynb here). The differences in the description of second line of code.
