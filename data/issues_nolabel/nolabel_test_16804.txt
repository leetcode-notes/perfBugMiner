Add optimized gif support for decode_gif

While revisiting the issue of #15838, I noticed that currently optimized gif is not supported. However,
optimized gif is actually possible to be processed as essentially the subsequent frame just adds the content on top of the previous frame on canvas.
This fix adds the support for optimized gif with decode_gif.
As is shown in the added test case, optimized gif (optimized.gif) could be handled the same way as original gif (scan.gif).
This fix fixes #15838.
