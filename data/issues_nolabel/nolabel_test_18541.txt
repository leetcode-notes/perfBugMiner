How to get started with Tensorflow Lite?

How do you get started with Tensorflow Lite? For example, how do you download and/or build it? How do you use it? All I can find is statements that "most of our documentation is on Github", but that seems to be a dead end.
The only documentation I found was the stuff in the g3doc folder, which includes build instructions for iOS and Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't say anything about Android.
