Increase compatibility with pathlib

Pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) is a nice standard-library for dealing with paths, but it seems that TensorFlow currently does not always accept them. E.g. when creating a FileWriter like:
logdir = pathlib.Path('/my/path')
log = tf.summary.FileWriter(logdir, sess.graph)

I get:
TypeError: Expected binary or unicode string, got PosixPath('/my/path')

While it's easy to work around this, it would be nice if this could be supported out of the box.
EDIT: this was using TF 1.1
