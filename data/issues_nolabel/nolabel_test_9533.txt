Added gradients + tests for ImageProjectiveTransform

Fixes #9423 by providing gradients for the base op.
Gradients are computed using the inverse of the transformation matrix which can be slow (even though it's 3x3 matrices only) but allows for dynamic transformation matrices. In case the transform is static, this might be precomputed. No gradients for the transform itself yet.
