Improve  documentation for tf.split_v

Hi,
I was reading through tf.split_v documentation. I got confused because num_split is not there in the function arguments. To understand better, I read the examples and found that the argument order is not correct.
So, this pull request currently fixes the example of tf.split_v. If you agree that the documentation is not proper, then I can fix that too. Thanks!
