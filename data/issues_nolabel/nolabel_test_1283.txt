DEFINE_bool alias not working on Mac Python test-on-install

For bugs/issues, please fill in the following.  The more information you
provide, the more likely we can help you.
Environment info
Operating System: Mac
If installed from binary pip package, provide: This error occurs in Mac Python (2 and 3) test-on-install

Which pip package you installed.
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
Steps to reproduce

Go to http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-matrix-cpu/9/TF_BUILD_CONTAINER_TYPE=CPU,TF_BUILD_IS_OPT=OPT,TF_BUILD_IS_PIP=PIP,TF_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON2,label=mac-slave/console
See failures in tests:
tensorflow/python/platform/default/flags_test.py
tensorflow/python/tools/graph_metrics_test.py
Notice that both failures complain about "DEFINE_bool" not being an attribute.
Interestingly, "DEFINE_bool" is found at: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/platform/default/_flags.py#L111

But somehow it is not recognized during Python test-on-install on Mac.
What have you tried?
