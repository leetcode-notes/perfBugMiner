skflow  multiple_gpu.py error

When I execute python multiple_gpu.py I get following error. I have verified that my installation has cudnn v7 and cuda ( since I can run the translate.py example on gpu)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'logistic_regression/HistogramSummary_3/tag': Could not satisfy explicit device specification
