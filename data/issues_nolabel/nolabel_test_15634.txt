ImportError: libmklml_intel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory with python 2.7

Using my PC, not a VM
Installed Intel MKL-DNN by this guilde, but looks like something wrong, because when trying to make a test for tensorflow, got error:

Recently someone created same problem and it was closed with reason: PR #12975, but it was for a VM.
Can anyone explain, please, what i can be and how to fix it? Dont have any build_pip_package scrips at the TF folder.
Its doesnt looks like same problem as PR #12975
