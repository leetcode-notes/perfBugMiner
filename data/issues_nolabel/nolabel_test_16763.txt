CMake (Windows): Added support for ninja build and some fixes/changes

Most changes have comments stuck with them, but here's the summary of it.
Changes made:

Added EXACT flag on find_package CUDA to clarify it is building for exactly that version, the output "minimum required" can be misleading
Tests if the compiler is compatible with CUDA before it starts building
BYPRODUCTS/BUILD_BYPRODUCTS are added for Ninja to search for dependency, otherwise it will output the error shown below
ninja: error: 'zlib/install/lib/zlibstatic.lib', needed by 'proto_text.exe', missing and no known rule to make it
Visual Studio is the only generator with that will output under $(Configuration) directory, thus removed if it is not Visual Studio
Fixed CONFIGURE_COMMAND causing some CMake versions to break (it resets to default generator, the CMake I tried uses NMake Makefiles as default, which causes the output below
...
Submodule path 'third_party/benchmark': checked out '360e66c1c4777c99402cf8cd535aa510fee16573'
Performing update step for 'protobuf'
No patch step for 'protobuf'

Additional Info: The current version of CMake has a problem with its ninja generator, as it may produce an error below
ninja: fatal: CreateProcess: The filename or extension is too long.
