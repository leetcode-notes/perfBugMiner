Windows: Make TensorFlow build without --cpu=x64_windows_msvc

Since from Bazel 0.5.0, MSVC toolchain became the default toolchain on
Windows. So --cpu=x64_windows_msvc is not required as long as we adjust
the BUILD files in TensorFlow.
--cpu=x64_windows_msvc is also supported for now, but should be depracated.
The configuration for cpu value x64_windows_msvc is a duplicate of
x64_windows, which should be removed in the future.
