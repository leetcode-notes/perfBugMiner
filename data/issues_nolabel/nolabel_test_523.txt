Import Error: Ubuntu 14.04 Python 2.7

I followed the Pip Installation instructions and successfully downloaded tensorflow (as shown as "Successfully installed tensorflow wheel six setuptools").
However, when I entered "import tensorflow as tf" in python, it gives:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named tensorflow
I don't know what is the problem. Help please? Thank you so much in advance! :D
