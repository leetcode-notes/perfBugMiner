Add SONAME for Makefile-built libtensorflow_inference.so

Currently if we build our own shared library that depends on Makefile-built Tensorflow shared library, our built library is linking the Tensorflow library with absolute path. So added a SONAME to Makefile-built Tensorflow shared library to resolve this problem.
