TF serving for TensorFlow 1.7 or more

Dear all,
My machine is a MacBook Pro with  macOS HighSierra 10.13.1 and I am using tf 1.7.  I am trying to use tensorflow serving without any results since the doc is not updated for Tensorflow 1.7. The doc says to
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/serving
cd serving/tensorflow
./configure
cd ..
bazel test tensorflow_serving/...

But there is no serving/tensorflow folder in the container. Following the doc I did:

Create the container

docker build --pull -t $USER/tensorflow-serving-devel -f Dockerfile.devel .

Where the docker file is the one provided by the doc
2) Run it
docker run -it $USER/tensorflow-serving-devel

3)Try to build tf serving
root@5db9a099bd77:/# git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/serving
Cloning into 'serving'...

root@5db9a099bd77:/# cd serving/tensorflow
bash: cd: serving/tensorflow: No such file or directory

So, basically, how can I run my model in production? I also think that you should maintain a docker image with TF serving already built on it to make it easier for the community to use it.
