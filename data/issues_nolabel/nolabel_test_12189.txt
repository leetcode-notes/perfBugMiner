CI script for building Raspberry Pi wheels

This CL expands on @ebrevdo's original PR adding Pi support by integrating it into the CI build scripts. This is a step towards nightly builds of Pi wheels and distribution of prebuilt binaries.
Issue #9697 is still blocking us from switching to the latest Eigen version, which is required for ARM compilation, so the script makes a local change to work around this for now. There's also one header added to oauth_client.cc, because it's required by boringssl on this platform.
