Issues found by PVS-Studio

Hello,
Developers of PVS-Studio C/C++/C# static analyzer present their check report of the source code of 'TensorFlow' in the article, containing the review of the most suspicious code fragments they discovered.
You can read article at the official site:

I have provided links to GitHub for each code fragment to make viewing more comfortable. The article doesn't cover all the issues that were found by the analyzer, so perhaps it would be interesting for you to review them yourself. In case you have questions, feel free to ask them.
Best regards,
Sergey Vasiliev
