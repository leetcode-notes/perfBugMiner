Tensorboard: non-square images are overlapped

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04

Steps to reproduce

Log some non-square (rectangle, 72x105 in my case) images (at least two) with SummaryWriter.
Load the log file with tensorboard.
Now, you will see the images are overlapped on images tab.

What have you tried?

I tried to fix the CSS with Chrome debugger.
I changed height property in .tf-image-grid-0 .tag-name-cell.tf-image-grid and .tf-image-grid-0 .image-cell.tf-image-grid to auto, and it seems to be good.
However, I don't know what files need to be patched to apply this change.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
Here is a screenshot of overlapped images.
input/image/1, input/image/2 is not being shown properly.
Last image isn't overlapped.
