Clarify documentation of stacked cuDNN RNNs

Currently the documentation for cuDNN RNNs is unclear as to whether the RNNs (LSTMs or GRUs), when they are bidirectional and configured with multiple layers, integrate the outputs from both directions at a given layer n before sending it to the next layer n+1, or whether each direction works independently of the other. I.e. forward layers send information just to the forward layers above, and similarly for the backward direction. The difference in behavior is quite important and it would be great if the documentation is updated to state which behavior is being carried out.
