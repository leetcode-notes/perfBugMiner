ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

OS Platform and Distribution:
Linux Ubuntu 17.10
TensorFlow installed using pip
TensorFlow version: 1.6, with GPU support
Python Version: 3.6.4
CUDA version: 9.1
GPU model and memory: NVidia GEForce 940MX 2GB
command to reproduce:
~$ python3



import tensorflow as tf
(basically run any tensorflow program to reproduce)



Problem:
Whenever you run a tensorflow program, you get a huge error log, but the main problem is this:
ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
So, the reason this is happening is because TensorFlow wants Cuda 9.0, but I have Cuda 9.1. This problem can be fixed by installing Cuda 9.0, but I have a few requests. Seeing that a couple of people have this problem (see #15604, #15817, #15817), I think that TensorFlow could be updated so that it works with Cuda 9.1 (but I think this issue is only with Ubuntu), or the following could be done:
Update the TensorFlow documentation, saying that you specifically need Cuda 9.0 for TensorFlow 1.6, and Cuda 8.0 for TensorFlow 1.4, and so on
And also, include this in the errors list at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#common_installation_problems.
Edit: If a Pull Request is required to update the documentation, I am fine with doing that.
