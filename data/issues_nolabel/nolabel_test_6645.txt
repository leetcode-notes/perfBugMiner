Error: Found more than one graph event per run

Hello,
I am trying to debug an issue that I am having with a model. When I decide to kill the training process, I remove the tensorboard logs, and fix an issue. Afterwards I restart the process.
Slowly, I seem to have accumulated tensorboard graphs, because I get the following Warning (multiple times)
WARNING:tensorflow:Found more than one metagraph event per run. Overwriting the metagraph with the newest event.
WARNING:tensorflow:Found more than one graph event per run, or there was a metagraph containing a graph_def, as well as one or more graph events.  Overwriting the graph with the newest event
Any idea how to resolve this issue?
