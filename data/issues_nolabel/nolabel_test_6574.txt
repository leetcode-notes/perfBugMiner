C drive space usage

EDIT:  MY MITAKE
sorry guys
//I ran this ..
docker run -it -v /$(pwd)/tf_files-local:/tf_files-container gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel
then started retrain.py to train my model. Suddenly it took around 60GB of my C drive. I tried to clean using CC Cleaner, Windows DiskCleaner, Uninstalled TensorFlow ,Deleted every file i created including bottleneck files, but still its taking up that space.
Help Needed.//
