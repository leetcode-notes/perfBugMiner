adding missing dep on jdk for gen_ops.bzl

sandboxed builds for this target are broken with the following error:

external/local_jdk/bin/jar cMf bazel-out/linux_gnu_x86-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/java/ops/java_op_gen_sources.srcjar -C bazel-out/linux_gnu_x86-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/java/ops .
external/local_jdk/bin/jar: error while loading shared libraries: libjli.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I found a similar issue in bazelbuild (bazelbuild/bazel#444), seems to be the case that this error is produced when a (e.g, the genrule in line 476) is missing the JDK as an input to the action.
