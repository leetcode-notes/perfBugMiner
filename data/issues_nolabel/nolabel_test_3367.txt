model with batchnorm runs overfit in multigpu training,but is ok in single gpu. mutilgpu model is based on cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py

mutil gpu code based on cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d42facc3cc9611f0c9722c81551a7404a0bd3f6b/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py)
two implementation of batch norm  is overfit in multigpu ,but is ok in sigle gpu.
one implementation based on inception batch_norm function: (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/slim/ops.py)

the other implementation base on :
