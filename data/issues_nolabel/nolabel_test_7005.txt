TypeError: inputs must be a sequence occure in Bidirectional RNN

Sorry to bother.
I just use the bidirectional rnn now.
However, I just encounter some problem.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test1.py", line 19, in <module>
    sequence_length=length(sequence),
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py", line 530, in bidirectional_rnn
    raise TypeError("inputs must be a sequence")
TypeError: inputs must be a sequence

I don't know what the problem it is?
The following show my code.
import tensorflow as tf

max_length = 100
frame_size = 64
num_hidden = 200

def length(sequence):
    used = tf.sign(tf.reduce_max(tf.abs(sequence), reduction_indices=2))
    length = tf.reduce_sum(used, reduction_indices=1)
    length = tf.cast(length, tf.int32)
    return length

sequence = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, max_length, frame_size])
output, state = tf.nn.bidirectional_rnn(
    tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(num_hidden),
    tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(num_hidden),
    sequence,
    dtype=tf.float32,
    sequence_length=length(sequence),
)
The code I refer to the blog that other issue demonstrate and recommond.

I try to figure out why the exception was raise.
import tensorflow as tf
import collections

self.input_sentences = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, sequence_length, embedding_size])
print "six: ", isinstance(self.length, collections.Sequence)
This is the part of my code.
However, the result is shown below:
six:  False

Is somebody encounter such this problem?
or how can I solve this?
I use CPU only, the OS is ubuntu 16.04
the version of tensorflow is 0.12.1
