module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'Variable'

I used to install tensorflow.  But after I found that it was cpu version, I installed tensorflow-gpu and uninstalled the original tensorflow,which is the cpu version.  But when I used this module, there was something wrong, which said module 'tensorflow' had no attribute 'Variable'.  I don't know how to fix it.
