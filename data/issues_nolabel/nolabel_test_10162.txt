Describe the problem
The gist below fails reproducibly with the following error both from a jupyter notebook or the command line :
ResourceExhaustedError (see above for traceback): ./models/m9-6/model.ckpt-826.data-00000-of-00001
	 [[Node: save/RestoreV2_6 = RestoreV2[dtypes=[DT_FLOAT], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](_recv_save/Const_0, save/RestoreV2_6/tensor_names, save/RestoreV2_6/shape_and_slices)]]

I added some explict del and explicit garbage collection but that doesn't seem to change anything. I'm not sure if this is an OOM per se or if it is a different kind of resource exhaustion. In any case I wasn't expecting fitting a fresh model m repeatedly in a loop to be an issue so I'm reporting this in case it happens to be a TF issue.
