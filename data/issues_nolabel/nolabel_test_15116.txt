Any other official way(not public in github issues) to report security bug of tensorflow?

Hi,
I have found a security issue in Tensorflow. An attacker can easily execute arbitary code on victim machine through this issue. I think it has severe secure impact on tensorflow users. So it is not proper to disclosure this issue on github issues publicly before it is fixed.
Is there any other official way to report security issue? I will explain the details.
Thanks.
