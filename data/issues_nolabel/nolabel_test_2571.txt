_pywrap_tensorflow.so: Undefined symbol "_ZN9perftools8gputools3rng10RngSupport13kMinSeedBytesE"

Hello,
I am trying to bring TensorFlow support to FreeBSD. Considering there is Mac support, I figured FreeBSD support couldn't be too bad to work on. I have hit a few snags along the way but nothing show stopping yet. My latest problem is I'm getting an undefined symbol error. I do not want gpu support for the FreeBSD port, but I can see ::perftools::gputools are scattered all throughout the source code. If you could give me any feedback as to what to look into to fix this, that'd be great.
Environment info
Operating System: FreeBSD 10.3
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: None
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: d8eb4bb
Steps to reproduce

Build TensorFlow on FreeBSD 10.3 with Clang 3.8
Try to import tensorflow in Python3 REPL

Things I've tried
I also tried this with Python 2. Same results.
