Unable to run model in iOS: dtype() == expected_dtype (9 vs. 4)

System information

iOS emulator
TensorFlow version v1.1.0rc2
compiler flag: -O3, -D__ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM__ replaced by -D__ANDROID_TYPES_FULL__ inside tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile in order to fix a issue of missing kernel
modification made: tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_floor_mod.cc added to tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_op_files.txt b/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_op_files.txt in order to fix another issue of missing kernel

Describe the problem
I am trying to run the deeplab image segmentation on iOS.  I have freezed the model, which can then be run on a python shell.  But when I put it on to iOS, it crashes.  Please see the log from xcode below.  I am sure my build of tensorflow is working because I can run another model.
Source code / logs
The log comes from running a quantized model.  running a non-quantized version lead to the same problem.
