graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():

Describe the problem
This simple script fails if some dir contains a file without read access somewhere in subfolders of /some/dir. So for instance if I don't have permission to read /some/dir/subfolder/filebelongingtosomeoneelse, the script fails (while I have permissions for subfolder).
Strange thing is that neither read access needed to know its filename, nor it is actually will be listed in the output (so it should be skipped during scanning).
