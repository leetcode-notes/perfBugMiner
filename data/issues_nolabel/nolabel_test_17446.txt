tf.image.resize_bilinear outputs weird when scale from [256, 256] to [96, 96]

I have a three band .tif image of size [256, 256, 3], I tried to scale to [128, 128], the output look fine. However, when I tried to scale to [96, 96] the output is only rgb noises.
Anyone has the same experience?
image = tf.image.resize_images(image, [96, 96])
