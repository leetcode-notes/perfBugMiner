port::AlignedMalloc() may cause a memory leak

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Sierra Version 10.12.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0, Darwin, cpu
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

# NOTE: Please install Xcode 8.3 first!
$ git clone https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-TensorFlow.git
$ cd Perfect-TensorFlow
$ ./test.sh

Describe the problem
When developing Perfect-TensorFlow, a Swift Class Wrapper of C api https://gihub.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-TensorFlow, I found there might be a memory leak when performing such a test:
testing script: https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-TensorFlow/blob/master/Tests/PerfectTensorFlowTests/PerfectTensorFlowTests.swift#L153-L167
currently I am using libtensorflow 1.1.0 CPU version on both macOS / Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and found the same leakage on the both systems, hope to get solution once 1.2+ released.
Using Xcode - Instruments may find the trace as screen shot below:
