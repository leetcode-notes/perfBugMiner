What version of cuda and cudnn does TF 0.8 support?

Hi, I have installed Cuda 7.5 and Cudnn v5 for use with TensorFlow 0.8 and am getting the following error when trying to run /tensorflow/models/image/mnist/convolutional.py
F tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:427] could not set cudnn filter descriptor: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM
Aborted (core dumped)
Should I be using an older version of Cuda and/or Cudnn? Thank you
