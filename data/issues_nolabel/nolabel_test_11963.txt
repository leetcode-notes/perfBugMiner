Describe the problem
I tried to use Infiniband with tensorflow using server = tf.train.Server(cluster, job_name=FLAGS.job_name, task_index=FLAGS.task_index, protocol='grpc+verbs').
But the session is not hanged.
I used S1, and S2, the cluster is configured with the Infiniband ip address. Is there something that I missed?
ibdev2netdev
S1
mlx5_0 port 1 ==> ib0 (Down)
mlx5_1 port 1 ==> ib1 (Up)
S2
mlx5_0 port 1 ==> ib0 (Up)
mlx5_1 port 1 ==> ib1 (Up)
