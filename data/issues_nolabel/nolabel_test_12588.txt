Error with tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy: weights?

I use the function tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy for my unbalanced dataset but i get error when using it. My question is if my labels in one batch have shape (8,4096) , my prediction or logits have shape (8,4096,14) and I have 14 classes. What should the shape of my weights?
Another question: should i have one specific weight for each class or a specific weight for each sample?
Thanks
