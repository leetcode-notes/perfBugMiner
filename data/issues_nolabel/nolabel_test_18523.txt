Unable to freeze graph for LinearClassifier

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Anaconda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:  N/A
GPU model and memory:  N/A
Exact command to reproduce: freeze_graph for LinearClassifier model

I'm trying to freeze my model using the source https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/prepare_models. So I could use it in Android app (using Tensorflow Mobile).
I have a model created with LinearClassifier. Below is the example of creating it:
gender = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list("gender", ["f", "m"])
goal = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list("goal", ["fit", "lose", "muscle"])
level = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list("level", ["begin", "middle", "advance"])
feature_columns = [gender,goal,level]

input_fn = tf.estimator.inputs.pandas_input_fn(x=x_train, y=y_train, batch_size=100, num_epochs=None, shuffle=True)
model = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns, n_classes=18, model_dir="export")

model.train(input_fn=input_fn, steps=100)
The model is successfully created and saved. It works correctly when it's evaluated.
However, I'm getting the following error, when I try to freeze the graph:
TypeError: names_to_saveables must be a dict mapping string names to Tensors/Variables. Not a variable: Tensor("linear/linear_model/bias_weights:0", shape=(18,), dtype=float32)

I looked on StackOverflow and seems this issue happens to many people and there is no answer to that.
I would appreciate any help, because many people are having similar issue.
