Training model on Android

I want to training my model on the Android mobile phones by using Tensorflow. How to train the model and save the model on Android mobile phone? I can not find corresponding functions on Java API of TensorFlow.
Is it possible to find a way to implement such functions on android mobile phone? maybe tensorflow on Android with Python bindings? Or other Deep learning frameworkï¼Ÿ
