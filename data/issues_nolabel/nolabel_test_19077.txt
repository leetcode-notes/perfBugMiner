CSV parsing flow (TextLineDataset -> decode_csv) doesn't parse linebreak in quotes correctly

Using tensorflow 1.8, parsing the following file with decode_csv:
"a
b",0
raise the error "Quoted field has to end with quote followed by delim or end".
To reproduce:
file = ['example.csv']

dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset(file)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda record: tf.decode_csv(
    record,
    record_defaults=[[""],[0]]
))
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
next_element = iterator.get_next()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(next_element))

I think it is because the linebreak in the quote is not escaped. This behavior seems in contradiction with the RFC2048 specifications (section 2.6).
