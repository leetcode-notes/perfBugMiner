No nigthly build for Python3.5 GPU

According to the build history the last time the GPU version for python 3.5 was built was almost a month ago. That actually leads the download link from the README.md front page to point to a file not found page.
That's too bad because there are some bug-fixes that I needed which are then not included (#7585 for instance).
