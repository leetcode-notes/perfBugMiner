Add tf.regex_match for regex match support

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #18264.
Currently tf.regex_replace has already been supported though there was no regex match support.
This fix adds the tf.regex_match support in a similiar pattern as tf.regex_replace.
This fix fixes #18264.
Note: this PR is a preliminary implementation which support full match of the regex. Additional variations could be added or in follow up PRs if needed.
