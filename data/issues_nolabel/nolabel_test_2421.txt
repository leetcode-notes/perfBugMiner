SKLearn examples not working in the latest release

I've been trying to run some examples from the provided SKFlow examples located at
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/skflow
And most fail with dependency failures such as:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'datasets'
For:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/skflow/text_classification_builtin_rnn_model.py
I looked around the source code and some of this modules seem to have been moved around, maybe this examples should be updated or completely removed, I tried adapting the code to work however I ended copying big chunks of source code into the file to make it work.
using tensorflow 0.8
