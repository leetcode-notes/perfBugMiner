Random functions always return 0 when using CUDA 7.5

Environment info
Operating System:
Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: 48e6165
Steps to reproduce

Compile from source and during ./configure process specify CUDA 7.5
Run the following script

import tensorflow as tf
v = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([3,2], mean = 12.0, stddev = 0.1))
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
sess.run(v)


The result is 3x2 array of zeros rather than random value centered at 12.0. The same happens for all random variables

To solve it
Use CUDA 7.0 solved the problem for me.
