Switch back to Ubuntu 14.04 for our releases.

Haven't tested this yet. Letting Jenkins do the work.
@caisq fyi. Note that we should keep our Docker Hub images on Ubuntu 16.04 because that fixes the bugs users encounter.
Note for others looking at this change: we're downgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 for official releases so that it links against the older version of glibc and allows for wider compatibility.
