Fix for #13498

@skye I'm kind of indecisive it turns out. :P This is just your fix along with an equivalent fix for RemoveEdge. I don't know if you want to merge it given that you might make changes to your fix, but I'm putting here just in case. The RemoveEdge fix is pretty much equivalent and since the method is not used in the graph constructor, I didn't change its call sites to use false for the update node def argument. I'm not sure if that collides with anything else, but I guess the tests can tell us something (I didn't run them on my laptop because they take forever and I can't use it in the meantime).
