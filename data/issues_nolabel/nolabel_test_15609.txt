The relationship between neural network depth and accuracy

Hi:
I am learning to design a simple neural network, and try to identify 28x28 pixel greyscale images in the MNIST dataset.
I find that the neural network depth is not directly proportional to the recognition rate,
one layer neural network recognition rate: 92%
two layer neural network recognition rate: 94%
four layer neural network recognition rate: 91.8%
Can someone help me analyze it?
