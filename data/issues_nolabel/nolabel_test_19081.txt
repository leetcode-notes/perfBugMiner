tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py - lines 465-469:
    if self.distribution == "normal":
      stddev = math.sqrt(scale)
      return random_ops.truncated_normal(
          shape, 0.0, stddev, dtype, seed=self.seed)

Describe the problem:
According to He et al (2015) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.0185] (Eq. 10) the correct scaling for the standard deviation for kernel initialization is sqrt(2/n). However line 466 of tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py reads:
stddev = math.sqrt(scale)
where the default scale is 1/n (n depending on fan mode), corresponding to sqrt(1/n) rather than sqrt(2/n) - therefore giving half the correct scaling.
Also - since a truncated (-2SD to +2SD) normal distribution is used rather than a full distribution, shouldn't the scale be multiplied by 1.137? Perhaps the simplest fix is therefore:
stddev = math.sqrt(2.274*scale)
