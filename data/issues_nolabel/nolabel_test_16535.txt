only merge specific kind of summary

Currently, I need to gitve tf.summary.merge an input arg to specify what summaries to merge.
But it will be more convinient if there is a function called tf.summary.merge_scalar / tf.summary.merge_image cause scalars and images are often logged with different frequencies, and they need to be merged seperately.
