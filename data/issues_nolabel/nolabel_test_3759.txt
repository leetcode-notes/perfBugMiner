We switched over a working Seq2Seq model to use the LSTMFusedCell (previously GRUCell).  The graph build is a lot faster, but the step times are slower.
By profiling the ops (using timeline to generate a chrome trace file) we discovered that most of the processing was occurring on the GPU, as specified, but the LSTMFusedCell ops were all running on the CPU.
There may be a known issue, as referenced by @wchan in #2002  - however that PR is closed.
