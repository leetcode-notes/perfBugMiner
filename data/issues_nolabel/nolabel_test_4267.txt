libcuda reported version is: Not found: was unable to find libcuda.so DSO loaded into this program

i am trying to install tensorflow on my laptop LenovoY700, so that Ubuntu16.04 is more suitable with laptop.
I installed cuda7.5+cudnn4 with GTX960M and nvidia-version is 367.
When I was running 'convolutional.py', something goes wrong.

Could somebody give me a hand?
Thanks for your help.
