AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'truncated_normal'

Trying to follow tutorial from Kaggle to implement Convolutional NN. import tensorflow seems to execute without returning an error.
Code to reproduce:
In [74]: 
def weight_variable(shape):
     initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1) #Outputs random values from truncated normal distribution.
     return tf.Variable(initial)

In [75]: 
W_convl = weight_variable([5,5,1,32])

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "<ipython-input-75-65b9a0522cb2>", line 1, in <module>
    W_convl = weight_variable([5,5,1,32])

  File "<ipython-input-74-ae39e79c161a>", line 2, in weight_variable
    initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1) #Outputs random values from truncated normal distribution.

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'truncated_normal'

I have tried:
import tensorflow as tf
And:
from tensorflow import truncated_normal
Not sure what is going on.
