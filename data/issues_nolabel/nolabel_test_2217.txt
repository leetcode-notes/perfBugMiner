Wrap cuSOLVER in stream

I have started to wrap NVIDIA's cusolver library (LAPACK-like) for my work on #367. Is this something the TF team would consider supporting/helping with? I have so far only wrapped potrf, but adding more functions should be fairly easy now that I have done the long-winded bit.
Its in my fork.
