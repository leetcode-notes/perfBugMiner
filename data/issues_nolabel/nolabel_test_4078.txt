Installation Issue:  Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1.

In the step where I have to run
bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu
I get the following messages:

P.S. I have two GPUs installed on my server. One is used for GUI (AMD) and the other is used for computation (NVIDIA).
Should I do anything to make sure the second GPU is being used?
