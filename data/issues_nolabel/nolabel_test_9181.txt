fix filter position for Im2Col

cac52fd fixed the filter position for
the reference class but the same problem exists in the Im2Col class.
This patch makes the calculation of the filter position consistent
with the reference quantized class and the gemm/fused conv_ops
classes.
@petewarden you reviewed the reference class fix. Would you have the time to review this too?
