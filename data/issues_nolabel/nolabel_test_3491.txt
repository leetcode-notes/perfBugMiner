Unified file system support implementation for C++/Python

Currently the C++ code has file system interface and provides POSIX and GCS implementation. However, part of the Python code also using another file system abstraction (tensorflow/python/summary/impl/gcs.py). This is annoying and tedious to supporting new type of file systems. So what is the consideration here and whether this is plan to make the Python code depending on C++ IO abstraction only.
