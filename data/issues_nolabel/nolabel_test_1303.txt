Broken links in C++ API docs

Apparently most of the links in the main part of the index of the C++ API documentation are broken.
The problem seems to be that the first letter of each file name is in lowercase, so the links look like this:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/api_docs/cc/classEnv.html
Instead of this:
