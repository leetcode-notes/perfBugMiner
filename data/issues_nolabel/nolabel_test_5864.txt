Fixed wrong documentation on ctc_beam_search_decoder

The documentation for ctc_beam_search_decoder has an error. It claims that it is equivalent to ctc_greedy_decoder when top_paths=1. This gives the impression that if we only care about the best result, we should always use ctc_greedy_decoder. However, ctc_greedy_decoder just does a simple argmax at each timestep, which is not equivalent result to a beam_search with beam_width=100 and top_paths=1.
The only case they are equivalent is when both beam_width and top_paths are 1. This pull request corrects this documentation error.
