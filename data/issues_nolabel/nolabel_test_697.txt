Check if logdir already exists before trying to create it

Currently, running something like this:
tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, 'models/', 'model.pbtxt', as_text=True)
Will fail the second time its run because it tries to create a folder that now already exists. This patch fixes that behaviour by checking if the directory exists before attempting to create it.
