What is quantized data type? For instance qint8, quint8, qint32

In tensorflow document of class tf.DType: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#DType
There are three types:
tf.qint8: Quantized 8-bit signed integer.
tf.quint8: Quantized 8-bit unsigned integer.
tf.qint32: Quantized 32-bit signed integer.
And also related method about quantized data type. I searched online, but did not find useful resource about it.
Could you add some explanation in the document?
