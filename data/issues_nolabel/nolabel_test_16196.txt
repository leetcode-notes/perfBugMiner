Fix issue of branch switching not working with bazel

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #15957 where bazel stops working after switching git branch, and reconfigure with ./configure will not work as well.
This fix adds a quick fix as was suggested, by having export TF_CONFIG_TIME="$(date)"in configure.py and add it to the environ list in git_configure.bzl.
This fix fixes #15957.
