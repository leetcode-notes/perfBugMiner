The problem about data flow graph?

Hi everyone:
I am a beginner for tensorflow, and do not understand something about the demo in tutorial files, like following:

During testing, how can accuracy call the trained model for mnist.test.images and mnist.test.labels.
Does the trained model flow to the accuracy?
Can anyone help me? Thanks a lot!
