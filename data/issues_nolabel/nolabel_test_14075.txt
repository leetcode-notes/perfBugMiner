Momentum SGD is very slow with large embedding layer

Hi, I have an (256 col* 500000row) embedding layer in my model and I found that Momentum SGD is 10x slower than adam optimizer. When I printed the global variables using API :tf.global_variables(), I found a large Momentum  variable created by optimizer, does that means Momentum SGD have not  supported sparse update yet?
