after restore trained model checkpoint, the prefetch capacity become 500 which is 5 during training

when I restore my trained model and do predict it out of memory problem, how can I restore the original capacity? or how can I reset the capacity after restore?
I am using python-gpu 1.5
below is the operation information:
when training:
name: "prefetch_queue"
op: "PaddingFIFOQueueV2"
device: "/device:CPU:0"
attr {
key: "capacity"
value {
i: 5
}
}
after restore:
name: "prefetch_queue"
op: "PaddingFIFOQueueV2"
attr {
key: "capacity"
value {
i: 500
}
}
