[Feature] sparse_tensor_dense_matmul with two SparseTensor

Would it be possible to implement matrix multiplication between two SparseTensor?
Currently, it's possible to multiply two dense Tensor with many zeros using the X_is_sparse parameter of tf.matmul, and a SparseTensor with a Tensor using tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul.
However, with some datasets it is impossible to store dense matrices in memory and it would be great if we could have the option of fully sparse multiplication.
Thanks,
