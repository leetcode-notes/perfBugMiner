Recently,  google/nsync is added to Tensorflow master as an external dependency.
So, s390x support needs to be added to nsync module which includes code changes in BUILD file as well as adding source code in nsync package for s390x.
We could create platform specific subdirectory inside nysnc/builds for s390x by executing  tools/mkmakefile.sh script. Also, could build nsync separately on s390x by executing command make depend test.
However, Tensorflow also uses code from platform-specific sub directories available inside  nsync/platform/   which has source code containing assembly instructions.
Need information on how to generate similar code structure for s390x (we could see ppc, windows , arm etc platforms are supported).
@gunan As we are not able to create an issue on nsync repository, could you please let me know whom to contact for this?
Note: In Tensorflow, nsync dependency is added through this commit.
