Cannot see summaries after running "mnist_with_summaries" exmaple

Hi, I'm learning something about tensorboard and summaries. After I run the code from /tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py, open the tensorboard, I can't see any histograms or scalar summaries. All are blank. It's wired.


operation system: ubuntu14.04
gpu: gtx1080
cuda 7.5
cudnn 4.0.7
install tensorflow from sources
Another thing I should mention is that I cannot run the mnist_with_summaries.py directly in Pycharm. Its log like that
/usr/bin/python2.7 /home/lan/Packages/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/lan/Packages/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py", line 27, in <module>
    import tensorflow as tf
  File "/home/lan/Packages/tensorflow/tensorflow/__init__.py", line 23, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python import *
  File "/home/lan/Packages/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/__init__.py", line 48, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python import pywrap_tensorflow
ImportError: cannot import name pywrap_tensorflow

Process finished with exit code 1

So I run the code in terminal by python mnist_with_summaries.py. It do run successfully, but there are warnings (or sth?): Unhandled API Callback

I'm not sure if this warning influences summaries.
