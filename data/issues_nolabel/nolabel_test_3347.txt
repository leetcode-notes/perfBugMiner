Cuda/Cudnn file name change break ./configure & Bazel build

Ubuntu 16.04
Gtx 1080
Building master (614d4c1)
Cudnn 5 (Nvidia site download)
Cuda 8

I've got the above mostly installed, except for Tensorflow itself.
But anyways, Nvidia seems to have changed the file names on this stuff, and it is not what Tensorflow's configure and Bazel are expecting.
Actual error message below:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
ERROR: /home/john/.cache/bazel/_bazel_john/79381a0230f40e8d23e37c3a71bb0cd2/execroot/tensorflow/third_party/gpus/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.8 cannot be found

Cuda 8 toolkit is missing.
1. Download and install the CUDA 8 toolkit and CUDNN 5 library;

But ls /usr/llocal/cuda-8.0 looks like:
libcublas.so libcublas.so.8.0 libcublas.so.8.0.27
This is the fourth time there has been a file name change using this Tensorflow commit or perhaps Cuda/Cudnn.
I wouldn't mention this if it was one file change but it's at least 4.  May throw a bunch of beginners off.  Or perhaps I'm the beginner doing something wrong.
Just something I ran into and seems like a Nvidia file naming change.
