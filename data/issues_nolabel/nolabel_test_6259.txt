Embedding Projector Standalone isn't reading its demo data folder

Upon opening https://github.com/tensorflow/embedding-projector-standalone, there is nondescript popup error message and application loads with no data.
index.html has:
projector-config-json-path="oss_data/oss_demo_projector_config.json"
but the data isn't loading.
Project also has no Readme so perhaps I'm not running it, correctly?
