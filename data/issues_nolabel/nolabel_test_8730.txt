Fix broken links in `contrib/learn/python/learn/README.md`

This fix fixes broken links in contrib/learn/python/learn/README.md
by replacing g3doc with appropriate URLs, e.g.,
-    ([docs](../../../../g3doc/api_docs/python/contrib.learn.md#LinearClassifier))
+    ([docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/LinearClassifier))

NOTE: Inside contrib/learn/python/learn/README.md there are still
several g3doc references after this fix. However, the remaining links are actually
correct and are not broken.
