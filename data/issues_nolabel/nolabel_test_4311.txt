Configure takes a lot of time and resources

in the last few weeks I notice that while developing operations for tensorflow I find myself doing ./configure many more times and each time takes few minutes on a good internet connection.
Can we cache some of the artifacts ? Do we have to remove all the time the complete protobuf repository ? How is this handled internally at google ?
