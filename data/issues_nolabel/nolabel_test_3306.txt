.Save, .Restore for contrib.learn.DNNClassifier

The older functions like skflow.TensorFlowDNNClassifier had methods .save and .restore.  These were supposedly migrated over to the contrib.learn functions, but there are no longer save and restore methods that I can find.  Is there a new protocol for saving the graph and variables with the new contrib.learn package?
