What are the 'from' and 'to' dimensions of transition_params in tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_likelihood?

On TensorFlow, I want to pass a transition_params matrix as argument to tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_likelihood (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/crf/crf_log_likelihood) in order to initialize the transitions matrix of the CRF. Although, in the documentation, it doesn't state which dimension of this matrix corresponds to the first tag of the transition and which dimension corresponds to the second.
So, let T be the transitions matrix, does T[i,j] represent the score of the transition from tag i to tag j, or is it the other way around?
