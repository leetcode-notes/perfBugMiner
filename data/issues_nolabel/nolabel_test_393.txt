TensorBoard,No scalar summary tags were found

sess = tf.Session()
init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess.run(init)
summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('./tmp/tensorflow_log', graph_def=sess.graph_def)
However after launching TensorBoard I can not see any grah def info..
I also tried tf.training.summary_io.SummaryWriter, but it will not generate any log..
""
No scalar summary tags were found.
Maybe data hasn't loaded yet, or maybe you need to add some tf.scalar_summary ops to your graph, and serialize them using the tf.training.summary_io.SummaryWriter.

Seems there are people facing the same issue, on stackoverflow but not solved.
