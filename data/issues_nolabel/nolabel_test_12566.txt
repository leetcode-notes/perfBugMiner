enable use of transform_graph tool with contrib/rnn

This is a simple fix for using contrib/rnn with the transform_graph (and possibly other tools).
In particular, it fixes the following error:
2017-08-24 16:07:41.015752: E tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/transform_graph.cc:210] Op type not registered 'BlockLSTM' in binary running on ip-172-31-30-181. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.

It's also possibly a remedy for issue #11847.
