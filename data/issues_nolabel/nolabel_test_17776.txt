Fix incorrect link of checkpoint files in CNN tutorials

This PR is to fix the incorrect link of checkpoint files in CNN tutorials.
As we can see in CNN tutorials, below checkpoint files links to https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables#saving-and-restoring which is not correct.

cifar10_train.py periodically saves all model parameters in checkpoint files but it does not evaluate the model.

The correct intended link should be https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model instead.
