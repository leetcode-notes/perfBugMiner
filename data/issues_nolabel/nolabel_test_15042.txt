Only install enum34 on Python <3.4 versions (Take 2)

Python 3.6 sometimes has issues with enum34 because the standard library
relies on enum features not in enum34 (see
https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/enum34/issues/19/enum34-isnt-compatible-with-python-36
for more details).
We'll avoid the new versioning syntax in setuptools to allow old versions of setuptools to still work (see #14779)
Do you mind taking a look @gunan @yifeif?
