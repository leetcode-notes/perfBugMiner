Tensordot sometimes fails one of the operands has a single dimension

This error occurs when one operand has a single dimension, and the other operand has a dimension of None.  To reproduce:
A = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 20])
B = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [20])
C = tf.tensordot(A, B, [[1], [0]])
throws TypeError: Tensors in list passed to 'values' of 'ConcatV2' Op have types [int32, float32] that don't all match. when trying to calculate the shape of the resulting tensor.
I've actually fixed this, I'll submit a pull request momentarily.  I just figured I would submit an issue first for clarity.
This is probably related to #6682; I'll might look into that as well
