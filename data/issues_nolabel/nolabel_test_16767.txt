Is there any way to reduce the model fie size of adam optimizer?

I find that the model file size is three times bigger after I switch optimizer from tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer to tf.train.AdamOptimizer. And here is the reason I found on stackoverflow:

ADAM adds two running means (for gradient and square of gradient) as additional non-trainable parameters for each trainable parameter

Thus, is there any way to reduce the model fie size of adam optimizer?
THANKS!!
