SparseTensor doesn't have get_shape() function

I've been trying to add SparseTensor support to Keras (fchollet/keras#3695) and one of the issues I've run into is that because of the lack of get_shape() I need to add SparseTensor-specific code.
Luckily so far I've only needed the rank of SparseTensors, so sparse.shape.get_shape()[0] has worked for me, but if I pass in a shape in the sparse_placeholder constructor (#4226) I would like to be able to retrieve it with sparse.get_shape()
