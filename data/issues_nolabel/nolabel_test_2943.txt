Extracting features from mixed layer in inception-v3

Hi,
For my project I need to extract the features from the mixed layer in inception-v3. But, for doing so I need the name of various tensor layer.
as far as I know
pool_1:0 correspond to (35X35X192) feature matrix
pool_3:0 correspond to (2048,) feature matrix
conv_1:0 correspond to ((147X147X32)) feature matrix
conv_2:0 correspond to (147X147X64) feature matrix
conv_3:0 correspond to (73X73X80) feature matrix
conv_4:0 correspond to (71X71X192) feature matrix
I am interested in final mixed layer [8X8X2048] mixed_10 as mentioned in model.txt Can you please tell me how to extract this layer
