Usage of bit_casted_tensor() function with C++ api?(implementation on IOS)

Any tutorial on this bit_casted_tensor function?
I am building an app on IOS based on ios-tensorflow model. The model generated a tensor with type float. However, for my model, a unit8 format is required. So I want to transfer the tensor's format.
I found this, bit_casted_tensor(), maybe useful for directly transformation. But I when tried to use it in the code like the following,
tensorflow::TTypes<tensorflow::uint8>::Tensor a_new_tensor = bit_casted_tensor(image_tensor); the issue use of undeclared identifier 'bit_casted_tensor' always showed up.
According to reference, bit_casted_tensor function should use like this:
TTypes< T, NDIMS >::ConstTensor bit_casted_tensor() const

Return the tensor data to an Eigen::Tensor with the same size but a bitwise cast to the specified dtype T.
Using a bitcast is useful for move and copy operations. NOTE: this is the same as tensor() except a bitcast is allowed.

I am not sure if I use it correctly? Or it is due to the limited support of tensorflow function on IOS platform?
Keen for any kind of help !!
