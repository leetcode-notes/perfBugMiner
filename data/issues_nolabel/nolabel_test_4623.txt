examples/image_retraining examples/android

hi guys:
i want to use a retraining model on the android device, and i moved the model.pb(retraining Inception v3 model ) and label.txt(containing two labels) to the examples/android/assets, but i got some problem as the figure.
(09-28 18:37:11.572 21326-21351/org.tensorflow.demo E/native: tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:160 Output [output:0] not found, aborting!)
Is there any document which explains detail about how to predict with a model in .cc file and how should i rewrite tensorflow_inference_jni.cc file to load the model.

thanks for your time
