Enabling TF to build LLVM AMDGPU backend for XLA

Hi,
When I enable XLA during configure stage and run bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package, it starts pulling llvm and build for ARM, PPC, X86 and NVPTX backends. Is there a way to enable AMDGPU backend? (Matter of fact, all backends supported by LLVM?)
