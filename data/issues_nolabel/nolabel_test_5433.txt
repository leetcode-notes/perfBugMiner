Fix misleading SaveDef V2 format warning

Adding a line: Notice: the V2 format output different set of files
The original warning made me think I can switch simply by adding the write_graph argument, but it turns out the outputs of saver.save(sess, "model.ckpt") are also different with the new format.
Originally, it writes to the file model.ckpt, but now it writes to model.ckpt.index and model.ckpt.data.*, which breaks the logic.
