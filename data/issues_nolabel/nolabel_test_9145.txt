Fix loading metadata in tensorboard embedding projector.

Fixes loading metadata (eg. vocab files, sprites) for display in
tensorboard's embedding projector plugin.
Since [1], project_plugin.pbtxt is looked for under the directory
$LOGDIR/plugins/org_tensorflow_tensorboard_projector, different to the
docs and where projector.visualise_embeddings() stores the file.
Revert to the previous location.
