OSX Yosemite "can't determine number of CPU cores: assuming 4"

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('hello, tensorflow')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
can't determine number of CPU cores: assuming 4
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:25] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 4
can't determine number of CPU cores: assuming 4
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_session.cc:45] Local session inter op parallelism threads: 4
got this warning but still works though
