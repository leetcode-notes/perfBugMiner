add an interface to check if a variable is initialized

Currently, if we create an Adam optimizer and minimize some loss, Adam will create some new variables that need to be initialized. Howerver, this is only a part of variables and we donot want to use tf.global_variables_initializer().
If there is an interface to check if a variable is initialized, then we can filter global variables and initialize only what needs to be initialized!
the interface should look like Variable.is_initialized() -> bool
