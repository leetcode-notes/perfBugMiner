Bazel Build fails with missing input file error @grpc

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No. Stock script is used.
OS Platform and Distribution: CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511.
TensorFlow installed from : Source.
Bazel version: 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.5
Exact command to reproduce:
./bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --spawn_strategy=standalone --genrule_strategy=standalone //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I am installing Tensorflow 1.1 on a system where I do not have root priviliges. Upon running Bazel command (mentioned above), I get the following error -
missing input file '@grpc//:include/grpc++/impl/codegen/string_ref.h'.
I need to include the path of gprc to the Bazel. However, I do not know how to find the location of these files and how to refer them to Bazel. I have tried to find these files in the filesystem and bazel downloads, but couldnt find them.
Another insteresting thing that is happening is -
Everytime I run the bazel command again, it gives me different error each time ( However, they all are related to "@grpc//: ". Some of the other errors I got were -
ERROR: missing input file '@grpc//:include/grpc++/impl/service_type.h'.
ERROR: missing input file '@grpc//:LICENSE'.
ERROR: missing input file '@grpc//:include/grpc++/server_builder.h'.
etc.
