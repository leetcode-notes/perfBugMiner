RNN's state_is_tuple doesn't work with initial_state

Assuming I want to batch series of inputs and propagate the cell state from one session run towards another for an epoch:
for batch in epoch:
  state = initial_state.eval()
  feed_dict = {initial_state: state}
  state = sess.run([final_state], feed_dict)

Since using state_is_tuple in the cells makes the state be a tuple on return:

using .eval() doesn't work for an initial state
subsequent states are returned as tuples and cannot be fed back into the session as tuples
