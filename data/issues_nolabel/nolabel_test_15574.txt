Fix adding elements to collections.deque.

In some cases, word2vec_basic.py will fail at L123 and throw the following error:
TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'

It seams the text8 dataset and parameters will not touch that line code, but I hit this issue when I run this script against my own dataset. This is caused by Python collections.deque doesn't support index by slice:
>>> from collections import deque
>>> d = deque('tensorflow')
>>> d[:]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'

This PR fix this issue by using deque.extend, and this is consistent with L114.
