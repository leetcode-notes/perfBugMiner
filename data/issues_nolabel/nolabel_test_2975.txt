Steps to reproduce
I have created a REST webservice to execute machine translation with some modifications in translate.py.  If I run decode function in translate.py alone, on multiple runs I get the right output. But when I try to run the decode function through the webservice that I have created, the first time, I get the translation result. But on the second iteration, I get an error mentioned in the title.
What have you tried?

I tried to close the session at the end of decode function in translate.py.
