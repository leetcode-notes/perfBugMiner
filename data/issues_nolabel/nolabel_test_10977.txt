Support for tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax on CPU

Hello,
Recently I trained a  model using tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax on GPU and its working fine on GPU. I wanted to use the model on CPU but it seems that its not supported on CPU. How can I use this on CPU?
Will there be any support for it in near future? Or any suggestions on how to use this on CPU would be great.
Thanks!
