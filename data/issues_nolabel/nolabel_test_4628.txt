Compiled static library has different name than given in README.md

At url: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile in Building on Linux section of README.md file, when we run tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_linux.sh command, then the build file name written as following :
"This should compile a static library in tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/tf_lib.a "
But when I tried to run tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_linux.sh command, then it's generated file have following name:
/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a
Could anyone confirm me that why they are different? does docs have not updated name or something else.
