How to get the last timestep of the output of an RNN?

Just a general question which might also help others, namely what is the correct way to extract the last timestep of the output of an RNN. Is it as simple as
outputs, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=dropout_cell, inputs=outputs1, initial_state=initial_state, sequence_length=s)
last = tf.gather(outputs, int(outputs.get_shape()[0]) - 1)
Or should i transpose the output before performing gather, as per this example
outputs, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=dropout_cell, inputs=outputs1, initial_state=initial_state, sequence_length=s)
outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, [1, 0, 2])
last = tf.gather(outputs, int(outputs.get_shape()[0]) - 1)
Thank you
