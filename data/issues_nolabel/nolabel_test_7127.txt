graph nodes inside sess.run() brackets should be garbage-collected

My input pipeline returns current epoch, and batch of images.
epoch,label_batch,image_batch  = my_input_pipeline(.....)
.....
Two examples:
sess.run(epoch[0],train_step_run)
gives 15 examples per second and RAM get filled over time very slowly.
sess.run(epoch,train_step_run)
runs 100 examples per second and is stable.
It would be great to make sess.run brackets "special" so that some TF function within it does not construct an infinite graph.
