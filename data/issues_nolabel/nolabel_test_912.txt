"Cannot allocate memory" error on first Udacity assignment

Though, as the screenshot shows, I have allocated 5GB of memory to the Docker container running the course's first Jupyter notebook, I can't seem to get past this cell because of Python's cannot allocate memory error. Sometimes it happens with notMNIST_large/B and sometimes with notMNIST_large/C. I don't see why this error is thrown when the container reaches 1.4GB, since it should be able to go up to 5GB...
I doubt this is a problem with TensorFlow but, since it's part of the course, I figured this issue might be helpful to other students as well.
This is the Docker command I'm running (differs from the original command in that this gets rid of --rm and adds --memory=5gb):
docker run --name udacity_deep_learning --memory=5g -p 8888:8888 -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow-udacity/assignments
