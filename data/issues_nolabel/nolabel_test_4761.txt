contrib.seq2seq initial commit

As advised by @lukaszkaiser from #4686, initial commit of the tf.contrib.seq2seq folder.
The purpose of this pull request is to agree on a skeleton for the tf.contrib.seq2seq folder, I took inspiration from the tf.contrib.layers folder and the tf.contrib.losses folder.
After this skeleton has been accepted, I will start by filling out the tf.contrib.seq2seq.loss with #4382 , the tf.contrib.seq2seq.rnn_decoder with #4686 and a tf.contrib.seq2seq.rnn_decoder_attention including kernel_test.loss_ops_test.py and kernel_test.layers_ops_test.py.
Please note, as some of the calls (BUILD?) for the contrib section are scattered across various folders, I might be missing some calls or definitions somewhere.
