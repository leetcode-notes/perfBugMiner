parallelize OneVsRestClassifier

Hi,
I have implemented a CNN model in a TensorFlowEstimator and I use it with a OneVsRestClassifier.
It works good.
When I am trying to parallelize it by putting n_jobs=2 in the OneVsRestClassifier, I got a strange error that I don't understand :
MaybeEncodingError: Error sending result: '[TensorFlowEstimator(batch_size=32, class_weight=None, clip_gradients=5.0,
config=None, continue_training=True, learning_rate=0.001,
model_fn=<function cnn_model at 0x11f22d500>, n_classes=16,
optimizer='Adam', steps=200, verbose=1)]'. Reason: 'PicklingError("Can't pickle <type 'module'>: it's not found as builtin.module",)'
Do you have an idea of what does it mean ?
Thanks
