can tensorflow/compiler/aot/libruntime.so be renamed?

Describe the problem
linking -lruntime is a bit too generic (and prone to conflicts) for a large project
for instance -lxla_compiled_cpu_function
for
/tensorflow/compiler/tf2xla/libxla_compiled_cpu_function.so
is already more acceptable
In general would be useful for any library required to be linked in user applications to have a more descriptive name that associate it to tensorflow
