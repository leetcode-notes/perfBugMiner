Fix incosistencies in the shape of the input Tensor in Layers Doc

This pull request is to fix the inconsistencies in the Tensorflow Layers doc in #17892 and adds to #17893 which only fixes a single instance.
Problem
The Tensorflow Layers Guide at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers specifies:

The methods in the layers module for creating convolutional and pooling layers for two-dimensional image data expect input tensors to have a shape of [batch_size, image_width, image_height, channels]

While, the inline documentation specified for conv2D (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/layers/convolutional.py#L444) mentions the following valid data_formats:

data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first.
The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape
(batch, height, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to
inputs with shape (batch, channels, height, width)

There are several instances where height and width are not ordered correctly.
Moreover, for data_format=channels_first the shape should be NCHW while it is specified as CNWH.
This PR fixes these issues.
