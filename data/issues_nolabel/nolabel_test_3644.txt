Multiple tasks in the same server may cause OOM in distributed mode with GPUs

Following the official tutorial of distributed TensorFlow, we find that the ps and works will use the first GPU by default which may cause OOM in distributed mode.
If we don't set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, all the ps tasks may see all the GPUs and use the first one by default. And when I start all the ps and worker processes, OOM occurs and ps uses most of GPU's memory even though no job running.
Is that possible to optimize the algorithm of scheduler for more intelligence, such as using CPU for ps task and place operations in different GPUs instead of the first one?
One of the solution is specifying CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each task. Or we can use with tf.device() which may be only use for model parallel in distributed mode.
