Multi-CPU kernel for sparse_tensor_dense_matmul

Are there plans to implement a multi-cpu kernel for tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul? The current version seems to be single core only and is not performing well.
I am working with a very large sparse tensor - about 8GB sparse and 200GB dense that I cannot work with as a dense tensor for memory reasons. Any suggestions for achieving fast matrix multiplication?
