build offline documentation, how to?

I've noticed the API doc in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/index.html is not complete. Is there a way to build a nice HTML based API locally that contains a complete documentation?
Basically the question is: how is this https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/index.html being automatically generated? What's the magical command?
