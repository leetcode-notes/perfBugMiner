Environment info
Operating System:
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
For example, by following the link at summary_image found under the Model Inputs section. You will effectively land at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/train/ instead of https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/train/#image_summary since image_summary under tf.train module is now deprecated according to Release 0.12.0 release notes
