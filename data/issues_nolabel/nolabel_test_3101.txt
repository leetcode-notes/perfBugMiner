Softmax for multiple dimensions

Attention models get more popular. In many of my experiments with attention, I end up using Softmax over multiple dimensions.
tf.nn.softmax() supports only one dimension. It would be nice to expand the API with another argument, softmax_dim, for softmax over multiple dimension, say over 2 (images) or 3 (CT-scans, videos)
I;d like to here what you think? DO more people end up writing softmax code themselves?
