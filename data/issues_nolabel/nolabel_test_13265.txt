CheckpointSaverHook does not check Graph of Saver

The following code will run just fine, but will not save any Variables to checkpoints:
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    v = tf.get_variable("test", shape=(100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)

save = tf.train.CheckpointSaverHook("test_dir", 10)
with graph.as_default():
    tf.train.create_global_step()
    a = tf.constant(1)
    with tf.train.MonitoredSession(hooks=[save]) as sess:
        sess.run(a)
This is because the CheckpointSaverHook does not find an existing Saver, so it creates a new one in its constructor, which is executed with a different default Graph.
