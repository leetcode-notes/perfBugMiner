modify tensorflow/core/protobuf/config.proto

I try to modify config.proto.
I want to change per_process_gpu_memory_fraction from 1 to 0.2.
I modified it and builded it.
After I modified it, I compiled by using bazel
. /configure
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_packag

But I got error and I cannot compile.
