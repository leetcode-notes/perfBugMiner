[solved] Reducing the binary size

Hi , all ~
i am now succeed in using a cross compiled lib project call tensorflow.
now i got tensorflow run on ios , android and linux , using one same app code .
any one has any questions can ask me for help.
so my question now is turned to "Reducing the binary size". 
many posts told that to config  tf_op_files.txt, but my questions are:
1. need we also config other files such as  tf_pb_text_files.txt ,  proto_text_cc_files.txt  ... for reducing?
2. is there any other thinking for reducing than configuring the txt files Exhaustive Attackly ?
