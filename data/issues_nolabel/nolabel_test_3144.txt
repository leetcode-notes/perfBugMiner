Weird behavior with no skflow installation.

Environment info: Pycharm-Community Editon
Operating System: Ubuntu-14.04-x64
Pip package: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.9.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Tensorflow version 0.9.0 (from python -c import tensorflow)
When I was trying the text_classification examples from skflow repository (which are now moved to tensorflow), at line: word_list = tf.unpack(word_vectors, axis=1) it threw an error that says:
TypeError: unpack() got an unexpected keyword argument 'axis'
When I browsed the commit history on git, It says

2 days ago: Switch from split_squeeze to tf.unpack where it makes sense.

earlier it was working fine. Also it works fine when I run it on machine with skflow installed on it.
I have used tensorflow.contrib.learn as skflow as directed on the tensorflow home page.But somehow it doesn't work.
I have explored the tf.unpack() to check if it takes axis as an argument, but it doesn't. When I pass some other number that 1 to the tf.unpack() it says num can not infer from shape (?,50,10)
