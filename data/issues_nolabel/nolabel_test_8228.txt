Sorry I got question again。。。

Can TF use ram as swap space for GPU memory？ Cause  I ran a model with batch size 100 on GPU which will be out of memory on caffe. But on TF it works and just show pool_allocator. As I saw in other issues that's just a log. If it can swap why does it crashes sometimes? Is there any limitation?
