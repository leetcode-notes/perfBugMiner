Feature : Tensorflow works on ubuntu12.04

Hi,all:
I have a computing cluster,with a master and some slaves.
I want to tran the AI model on master, and then send to slaves for calculation。
But，for some reason, part of slaves works on ubuntu12.04, and i can not update them to 14.04.
so, how can i get a lite tensorflow or a saved model lib, than can be restored on ubuntu12.04 slaves.
Many thanks!
