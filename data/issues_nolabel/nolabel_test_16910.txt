Saver is saving empty .meta and .data files

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): I don't know , it's on google colaboratory
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4.1
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: i don't know, it's on google colaboratory
GPU model and memory: Tesla K40 12 gb
Exact command to reproduce: summarize_K40.py
I'm saving my model using:

saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.save(sess,checkpoint + str(round(update_loss / update_check, 3)) + '_e' +str(epoch_i),global_step=epoch_i)

but tensorflow creates all the files, but they are always empty i.e. 0 bytes
I'm attaching the source code, but I don't think it's my fault since once every 200 runs it actually creates non-empty files. I'm using google colaboratory
