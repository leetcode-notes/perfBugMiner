resize_images: Alignment of upsampled image seems incorrect with method=NEAREST_NEIGHBOR and align_corners=True

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.1.0-0-g1ec6ed5', '1.1.0')
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5- (@non-git)
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.5/5.1
GPU model and memory: M40, 12GB
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
My understanding of the behaviour of tf.image.resize_images with align_corners=True is that it would resize
[A B C D] => [A x x B x x C x x D]

if the input size was 4 and the output size was 3*(4-1)+1=10, where the x values would be determined by the method of interpolation.
(I will provide 1D examples, although I am actually working with images.)
I see the expected behaviour with method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR:
[0 3 6 9] => [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

however, with method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.NEAREST_NEIGHBOR the result is not what I expect:
[0 3 6 9] => [0 0 0 3 3 3 6 6 6 9]    # actual result
[0 3 6 9] => [0 0 3 3 3 6 6 6 9 9]    # desired result

Note that the nearest neighbor of the third 0 in the "actual result" is the element with value 3.
Source code / logs
I have attached a simple example that demonstrates this effect: nearest.py.zip
