Slim train_image_classifier or eval_image_classifier does not use any GPU

When I am using regular tensorflow codes there are no problem of using the GPU. But when I use slim, both train_image_classifier.py and eval_image_classifier.py does not use GPU. In my computer, there are 16 CPUs and One GPU. All CPUs are used, but the GPU is not used at all.
My environment is:
OS: Windows 10
Tensorflow 1.10rc0
Python 3.5
Cuda 8.0
cuDNN: 8.0
GPU Model: Nvidia Quadro M4000, 8G Mem
I am just use the default settings in train_image_classifier.py and eval_image_classifier.py. I tested different models, and GPU is always not used. Is this a bug or did I set something wrong? Thank you.
