Error building TensorFlow with local LLVM repository. ( Using local_repository extension in bazel )

Essentially, I want to run TensorFlow with a custom LLVM repository and not the llvm-mirror that bazel pulls from.
I made the following changes:


Changed the temp_workaround_http_archive rule in //tensorflow/workspace.bzl to:
   native.local_repository (
       name = "llvm",
       path = "/git/llvm/",
   )



Where /git/llvm is my local llvm repository.


In /git/llvm I added the file WORKSPACE containing:
 workspace( name = "llvm" )



Error log:
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
ERROR: /git/tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD:81:1: no such package '@llvm//': BUILD file not found on package path and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:licenses'.

Installed TensorFlow from source. Here is the version info:
$ git rev-parse HEAD
4c3bb1aeb7bb46bea35036433742a720f39ce348

$ bazel version
Build label: 0.4.5
Build target: bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/BazelServer_deploy.jar
Build time: Thu Mar 16 12:19:38 2017 (1489666778)
Build timestamp: 1489666778
Build timestamp as int: 1489666778

Now, obviously a llvm.build file is required, I just need to know how and where to place it. Also, how can I build tools like Polly from the bazel build files?
Thanks in advance!
