Add globs from Lambda before building it

The globals required to build the Lambda weren't loaded correctly. This leads to many problems when cloning a Model.
I'm not sure how to handle collisions.
This PR allows us to avoid using lambda with an inner import.
Small note: the latter one is more efficient and does the same thing.
globs = dict(list(globs.items()) + list(custom_objects.items()))
globs.update(custom_objects)
