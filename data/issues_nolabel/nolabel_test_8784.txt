fixes bazel/skylark handling of grep terminal colors when checking cudnn version

Fixes #8702
The issue was that on some systems, the environment or terminal are set up to use grep in a way that produces color-related formatting. They cannot be circumvented easily by command line manipulations. These "silent" color-formatting characters then go on to cause difficult-to-diagnose issues with the version checking logic in bazel/skylark.
The updated skylark logic would address this issue.
