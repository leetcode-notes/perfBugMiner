TensorFlow Models now missing ?

So currently doing some testing of the latest master branch on an AWS box. I built yesterday (UK time) and I went through installing tensorflow fine with no issues.
Today I have done a fresh install again taking from the master branch and for some reason when I run my samples through I get the following:
python -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional
