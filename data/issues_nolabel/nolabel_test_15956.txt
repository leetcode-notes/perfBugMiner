Tensorflow-lite breaks Android module.

Inserting Tensorflow lite inside an android module/library like this:
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
[some code]

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])

    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:+'
}

Results in this error when including the module and trying to running for Android API 19:

Error:Error converting bytecode to dex:
Cause: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define LR;

The module I am trying to include contains no classes, files  or other dependencies. All it has I a dependency of Tensorflow-lite. If I insert tensorflow lite directly inside the app, the problem goes away.
The problem doesn't happen in API 21+, and it only happens for API <= 19
I am using android gradle plugin 3.0.1, but I also trying with 3.1.0-alpha-04/5/6/7.
Is there a solution or work around to this problem?
