Gradient by a function issue

I find out an inconsistency in tf.gradients function.
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.get_variable("x", shape=(1,))
x2 = x * 2
x4_issue = (x * 2) * 4
x4 = x2 * 4

issue_grads = tf.gradients(x4_issue, x2)[0]
grads = tf.gradients(x4, x2)[0]

print issue_grads
print grads

I would expect the two prints have the same output because the expressions are equivalent.
However, output that I'm getting is following:
None
Tensor("gradients_1/mul_3_grad/Reshape:0", shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
