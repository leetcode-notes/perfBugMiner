Fix types image ops tests

Thanks to a recent comment by @martinwicke I realized that there's something wrong with the tests of test_image_ops.py. Combined with the use of use_gpu instead of force_gpu, the tests that were supposed to test the GPU implementation actually ran the CPU implementation.
After rectifying this, two bugs were found in the GPU implementation and corrected.
