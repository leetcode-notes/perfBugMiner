Feature request: ExportCostModels in C/Python API?

Exporting cost models of graphs seems to be a great feature with which users could figure out the resource-intensive (or even slowest) part of graphs, but currently it's not visible in the C/Python API.
I've tried to make it work and found that ExportCostModels() is not a member function in the "Session" interface. Also, a CostGraphDef object is related to a partition of some graph, placed on some device. ExportCostModels() in "DirectSession" only provides a mapping from partitions (note that for all the graphs executed) to CostGraphDef objects and it's hard to get CostGraphDef directly for the concerning parts. So I think there should be more works to make the code eligible and easy for use.
I wonder whether is anybody working on this and how developers think about this feature. Thank you!
