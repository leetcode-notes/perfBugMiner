Documentation does not explain the utility of -1 as value for the axis parameter of the tf.concat method

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X, version 10.13.2
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-rc1-5211-gab0fcac 1.5.0-dev20171126
Python version: Python 3.5.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):  N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:  N/A
GPU model and memory:  N/A
Exact command to reproduce: Just run a Python script with the code I am sharing with you

Describe the problem
It apparently concatenates along the last axis. See the following example:
import tensorflow as tf

t1 = [[[1, 2], [2, 3]], [[4, 4], [5, 3]]]
t2 = [[[7, 4], [8, 4]], [[2, 10], [15, 11]]]

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(tf.concat([t1, t2], -1))
    print(result)

which produces
[[[ 1  2  7  4]
  [ 2  3  8  4]]

 [[ 4  4  2 10]
  [ 5  3 15 11]]]

The following documention does not seem to explain this use case:
