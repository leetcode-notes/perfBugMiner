can't seem to find the urls to your provided binary packages

I was expecting to download a portable package (.whl or .egg) and use it as such:
import sys; sys.path.append( '/extensions/TensorFlow...win32.egg' )
import tensorflow # if this line doesn't work, the egg/whl is not portable.
# ...

when you say "provided binary packages" that just means I expect .pyd files within the egg or whl.
for an example of a portable egg, just look at pillow ;)
