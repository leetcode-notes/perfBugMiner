confusing warning of rank of input Tensor should be the same as output_rank

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.2.0-rc0

GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

cod (mostly from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/input_fn/boston.py)
from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.learn_io import pandas_io
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import pdb

tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO)

COLUMNS = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm", "age",
           "dis", "tax", "ptratio", "medv"]
FEATURES = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm",
            "age", "dis", "tax", "ptratio"]
LABEL = "medv"

training_set = pd.read_csv("boston_train.csv", skipinitialspace=True,
                           skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)
# test_set = pd.read_csv("boston_test.csv", skipinitialspace=True,
#                        skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)
# prediction_set = pd.read_csv("boston_predict.csv", skipinitialspace=True,
#                              skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)

feature_cols = [tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column(k) for k in FEATURES]

regressor = tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor(feature_columns=feature_cols,
                                          hidden_units=[10, 10],
                                          model_dir="/tmp/boston_model")

pd_input_fn = pandas_io.pandas_input_fn(training_set[FEATURES], y=training_set[LABEL],
                                        batch_size=128,target_column='medv')

regressor.fit(input_fn=pd_input_fn, steps=5000)

Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I saw a stakoervlow question here, but I don't think that applies to me.
I have the following confusing warnings.  As a result, I am not sure that everything is right.
WARNING:tensorflow:Rank of input Tensor (1) should be the same as output_rank (2) for column. Will attempt to expand dims. It is highly recommended that you resize your input, as this behavior may change.

WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/jiqiang/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py:625: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.
