Fixed XLA for integration as submodule

This PR incorporates some of the known workarounds like str(Label(...)) to enable the integration as a git submodule when using XLA.
This was only tested on a macOS environment with a project using tf_library.
Maybe someone with his/her own xla project could cross check this.
