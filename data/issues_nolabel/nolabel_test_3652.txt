What have you tried?

Downloaded the necessary files locally and linked to them in tensorflow/WORKSPACE, as well as in tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorboard/bower/BUILD, with no success (Note: This is my first time using bazel, so I may not have done this correctly.).
Googled the error; although many people seem to have bower-related errors with respect to downloading the files from GitHub, this seems to be a different type of error.
Reran the command many times.
Reinstalled nodejs, npm, and then bower on the computer and reran the command again.

Additional Information:
The package name in the error message rotates between iron_list, iron_icon, and iron_icons each new time the command is run.
Not sure whether this is relevant, but I am able to run the following commands for syntaxnet:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/syntaxnet/tensorflow
./configure
cd ..
bazel test syntaxnet/... util/utf8/...
with all tests reported as being passed.  The only changes made to the included files in order to pass all tests successfully were to:

Download gmock-1.7.0.zip manually, run the command: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000", and change line 79 of workspace.bzl to: "url = "http://localhost:8000/gmock-1.7.0.zip","
Change line 25 of models/syntaxnet/syntaxnet/parser_trainer_test.sh to: "BINDIR=$TEST_SRCDIR/$TEST_WORKSPACE/syntaxnet"

Please let me know if you require any other information!  Thanks in advance for your help.
