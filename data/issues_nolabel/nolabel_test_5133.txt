Environment info
Operating System:  macOS Sierra
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
current osx nightly
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
0.11.0rc0

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
In terminal window run 'tensorboard'
Output:

File "/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py", line 43, in main
logdir = os.path.expanduser(FLAGS.logdir)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'logdir'

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
A workaround is to rename tensorboard.py (I used tensorboard1.py) and execute with full path to that file.
Originally I printed __name__  and learned it was 'tensorflow.tensorboard.tensorboard'.
