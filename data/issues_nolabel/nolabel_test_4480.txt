`UnimplementedError: File system scheme` in sess.restore() with the path including colons.

I found that we get
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.UnimplementedError: File system scheme {{ part of path }} not implemented

When we try to restore the model from the directory which has colons in its path.
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

I have searched here tensorflow's issues with the words such as "colon", "File system scheme", or "UnimplementedError" but I couldn't find someone note this.

Environment info

Mac OS X 10.11.6
Python 3.5.2
Tensorflow 0.10.0 (from pip, https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0-py3-none-any.whl )
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: None

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf

s = tf.Session()
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.restore(sess, "path/to/somewhere/with:colon/model.ckpt-0") # where the path is exist with valid checkpoint.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Renamed the directory containing the checkpoint => fixed.

Note .generate.py is the user code and {{ path/to/somewhere/with }} was actual path of the model, but terminated before the colon.
