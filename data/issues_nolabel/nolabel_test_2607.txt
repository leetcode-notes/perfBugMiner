latest TensorBoard broken in Safari

Since about a week now there seems something wrong with the TensorBoard demo at https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/index.html#events. The graph shows nicely, but neither events nor histograms show up. This problem seems to be only with the demo -- everything shows up just fine when I run the corresponding code (mnist_tensorboard.py) locally.
