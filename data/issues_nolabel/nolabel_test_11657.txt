System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): win 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.10
Python version: 3.52
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0/5.1
GPU model and memory:2Gb
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
I trained my model in a GPU version tensorflow(1.10), but when I restore the model in another computer without GPU it throw the error at the fallow command:
result = mnist_classifier.predict(x = feature, batch_size = 1,as_iterable = False)
I had tested the whole project on the computer which trained the model, so I think the code is right.
