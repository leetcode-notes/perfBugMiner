tf.metrics doesn't include cross_entropy.

In tensorflow estimator, I want to use cross entropy as the evaluation metrics (eval_metric_ops parameter of EstimatorSpec)
However, tf.metrics doesn't have this function. Also, tensorflow estimator doesn't allow me to use tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits as the eval_metric_ops.
