build doc enhancements

The installation guide https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html could use the following improvements:

In the "pip installation" and "virtualenv installation" section, should specify that the wheel package is specifically for Python 3.4.
As a side note, a wheel package for Python 3.5 would be greatly appreciated.
In build from sources -> install other dependencies:
Replace:
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev
With:
For Python 2.7:
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev python-wheel
For Python 3.x:
$ sudo apt-get install python3-numpy swig python3-dev python3-wheel
In the build from sources section: specify that the compilation is VERY memory hungry (it won't fit on 8GB RAM), and suggest to add --local_resources 2048,.5,1.0 to the bazel build command as a workaround.
Alternatively, change the bazel script to detect the available RAM and scale down automatically.
