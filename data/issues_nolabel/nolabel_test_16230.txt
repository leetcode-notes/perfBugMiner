A new S3Client is created with all file operations.

Describe the problem
The S3 filesystem creates a new Aws::S3::S3Client object with all interactions with S3. This is a heavyweight object, and takes relatively large amount of time to create and destroy.
This should be a singleton associated with the filesystem object.
Fix shortly.
