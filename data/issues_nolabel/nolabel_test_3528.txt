rnn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn doesn't really take sequence_length of int32s

The docstring for rnn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn indicates that the sequence_length argument can be an int32/int64 vector, but array_ops.reverse_sequence only accepts an int64 vector as its seq_lengths argument.  I'll leave it to you whether the solution is to modify reverse_sequence or just amend the docstring.
