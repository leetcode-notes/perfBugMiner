Symlink loop FATAL error

Hello all,
I started teaching myself some tensor flow, and i faced a problem when trying to retrain an existing image classification model with a new class following that tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/image_retraining/
Since i installed tensorflow through pip and after reading a few issues, i had to download and install tensorflow from the source. when i got to configuring the install (calling ./configure) it gave me the following error:
____Loading package: tensorflow/contrib/lookup
____Loading package: tensorflow/java/src/main/native
____Loading package: tensorflow/tools/quantization
____Loading package: tensorflow/compiler/aot

Is there any particular way i can resolve this? I would really appreciate any input on the matter.
Thanks!
