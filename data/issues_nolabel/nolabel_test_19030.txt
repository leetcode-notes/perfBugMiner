Copy module list before iterating over it

Copying sys.modules.values before iterating over it. Seems like we are seeing errors that dictionary is getting modified during iteration on some plaforms.
Also, I am adding "from tensorflow import python" explicitly since we are iterating over modules under tensorflow.python.
