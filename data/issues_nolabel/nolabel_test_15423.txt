Can't build with basel Python Configuration Error: --define PYTHON_BIN_PATH

Can't get what im doing wrong.
Win7 python 3.6, tensorflow from master, cuda 9.0, cudnn 7.0.5 for cuda 9.0, basel and swig loaded today

WARNING: Running Bazel server needs to be killed, because the startup options ar
e different.
You have bazel 0.8.1 installed.
Please specify the location of python. [Default is C:\Users\Andrey\Anaconda3\pyt
hon.exe]:
Found possible Python library paths:
C:\Users\Andrey\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [C:\Users\Andre

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]: y
XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GDR support? [y/N]: y
GDR support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with VERBS support? [y/N]: y
VERBS support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to d
efault to CUDA 9.0]:
Please specify the location where CUDA 9.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README
.md for more details. [Default is C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/
CUDA/v9.0]:
Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuD
NN 7.0]:
Please specify the location where cuDNN 7 library is installed. Refer to README.
md for more details. [Default is C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/C
UDA/v9.0]:
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to b
uild with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.
com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your
build time and binary size. [Default is: 3.5,5.2]
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: n
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "-
-config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]:
Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the envi
ronment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.
Would you like to interactively configure ./WORKSPACE for Android builds? [y/N]:
n
Not configuring the WORKSPACE for Android builds.
