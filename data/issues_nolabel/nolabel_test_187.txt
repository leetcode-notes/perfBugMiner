Make Python/Numpy include paths configurable

The Mac OS X Numpy and Python include paths are hard-coded to /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/numpy/core/include and /usr/include/python2.7. I am on OS X 10.11 and I use the Anaconda Python distribution (installed to /Users/<user>/anaconda).
Currently, Bazel doesn't find my headers:
./tensorflow/python/client/tf_session_helper.h:4:10: fatal error: 'Python.h' file not found
#include <Python.h>
         ^
1 error generated.

It would be great if Python include paths could be configured in configure along with the cuDNN and CUDA paths.
