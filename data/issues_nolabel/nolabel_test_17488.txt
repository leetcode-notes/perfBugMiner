The tf.contrib.Predictor subclasses are useful to quickly run inferences, but at the moment it's impossible to configure the tf.Session instance used for inference, because it is created in __init__ without the possibility to pass a config to it.
My suggestion is then to add the explicit argument config to Predictor's subclasses' init functions and pass it to the Session constructor.
Note that, technically, for the {Contrib|Core}EstimatorPredictor classes one could already have a session_config defined in estimator.config.session_config, so perhaps this could be the fallback value when using these classes.
