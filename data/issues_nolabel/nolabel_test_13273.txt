Fix several issues with `go fmt` and `go lint`

This fix fixes several issues related to gofmt and golint based on https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
There are several changes:

gofmt -s tensorflow/go/tensor.go
gofmt -s tensorflow/go/example_inception_inference_test.go
golint tensorflow/go/genop/internal/lib.go

At the moment there are still quite a few golint and ineffassign warnings in the current go code base. However, all of them are from tensorflow/go/op/wrappers.go which is machine generated code.
This fix does not cover tensorflow/go/op/wrappers.go.
