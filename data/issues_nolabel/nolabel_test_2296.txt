Issue with retrain.py, "could not convert string to float" when creating bottlenecks

Steps to reproduce

Running the retrain with a very large image directory (around 600k files) causes the training to fail around 3/4 the way through, during the bottleneck creation process. It always seems to fail while within the same label folder, but it does not appear that any file names within that label folder are corrupted or named incorrectly.

What have you tried?

Changing the number of training steps
Checking to see if any files are less than 30k (theoretically, very small files are likely to be corrupted jpeg data)

Logs or other output that would be helpful
For 610,000 files, the process can't seem to get through more than 415k. Am I simply just using too many files? Or am I missing a very, very subtle naming convention issue?
Full stack trace:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py", line 30, in run sys.exit(main(sys.argv)) File "retrain_reshape_error.py", line 695, in main cache_bottlenecks(sess, image_lists, FLAGS.image_dir, FLAGS.bottleneck_dir, jpeg_data_tensor, bottleneck_tensor) File "retrain_reshape_error.py", line 400, in cache_bottlenecks image_dir, category, bottleneck_dir, jpeg_data_tensor, bottleneck_tensor) File "retrain_reshape_error.py", line 372, in get_or_create_bottleneck bottleneck_values = [float(x) for x in bottleneck_string.split(',')] ValueErrror: could not convert string to float
I should also note that I have been using this training process for the last few months with absolutely no failure.
Thanks!
