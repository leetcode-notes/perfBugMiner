Please provide protobuf 3.1.0 download

Since #4572, TensorFlow depends on protobuf==3.1.0.
This section of the installation instructions continues to point to a wheel for version 3.0.0, which doesn't help at all.
Therefore: please provide pre-built wheels for protobuf 3.1.0.
Also, those instructions tell me that I should only install the protobuf package after installing TensorFlow via pip.  But this isn't currently helpful advice: the TensorFlow package won't install at all, because there is no protobuf==3.1.0:
Downloading/unpacking protobuf==3.1.0 (from tensorflow==0.12.0rc1)
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement protobuf==3.1.0 (from tensorflow==0.12.0rc1) (from versions: 3.0.0b4, 3.0.0, 3.0.0b2.post2, 3.0.0a2,

Cleaning up...
No distributions matching the version for protobuf==3.1.0 (from tensorflow==0.12.0rc1)

I think what you're trying to say is that if I had been able to succeed in installing TensorFlow then I ought anyway to overwrite whatever protobuf pip had selected.  If so I'd suggest that this belongs higher up in the instructions, and not in some sort of trouble-shooting afterthought section that would easily be missed.
