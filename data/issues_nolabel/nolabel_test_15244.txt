Switched optimization mode for Pi builds to avoid internal compiler error

The nightly Pi3 builds have been failing with:

It appears to be the same problem that Chrome hit with gcc here:

Their solution was to change the optimization flags to avoid this, so I've followed their lead and switched to -O3. I hope this won'tl make a big latency or size difference, but it does solve the compiler crash at least.
