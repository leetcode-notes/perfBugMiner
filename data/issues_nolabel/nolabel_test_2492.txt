seq2seq decoding after training in the same script

According to FAQ, when session is closed, the model should be removed.
However, when trying to test the seq2seq model in TensorFlow 0.7.1 right after training (in a different session, but within the same python script), an error appears.
Specifically, rnn/translate/translate.py
I add decode() function after training in order to not re-run the script for decoding:
def main(_):
   train()
   decode()

After training I get the following error message:

ValueError: Over-sharing: Variable embedding_attention_seq2seq/RNN/EmbeddingWrapper/embedding already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope?

Log file with error
When running decoding separately, this code works fine. So, I am just confused why closing training session and opening a new one for decoding makes the program stuck...does it mean some model variables are not removed when session closes?
