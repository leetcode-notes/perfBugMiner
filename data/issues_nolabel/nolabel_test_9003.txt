set_random_seed bug

python2, TF 1.0.0
python3 TF 1.0.1
CUDA8, cudnn 5ish
gtx 980ti
program A:
import tensorflow as tf

tf.set_random_seed(0)
biases = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1], seed=0))

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
print(sess.run(biases))


program B:
import tensorflow as tf

biases = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1], seed=0))
tf.set_random_seed(0)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
print(sess.run(biases))

Program B outputs the same value at every run, program A outputs different values at each run. I  hope this is not expected behaviour.
