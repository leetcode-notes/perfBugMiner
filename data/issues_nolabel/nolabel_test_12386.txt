Describe the problem
I tried to extend SyncReplicasOptimizer where I need to use the result of ConditionalAccumulator's take_grad method after sync_token_queue.dequeue(), the program blocked. Then I looked into the code and thought that it might be caused  by  the step state in ConditionalAccumulator, but it still blocked.
Source code / logs
I could modify the official example a bit to reproduce the problem.
The cmds I used are as belowï¼š
python mnist_replica.py --job_name ps --task_index 0 --sync_replicas True
python mnist_replica.py --job_name worker --task_index 0 --sync_replicas True
python mnist_replica.py --job_name worker --task_index 1 --sync_replicas True
Where mnist_replica.py only changed a line of importing module, link.
And I edited sync_replicas_optimizer.py a bit, two versions in link1 and in link2.
