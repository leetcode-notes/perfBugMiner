scalar_summary within map_fn hangs when run.

On tf 0.9, it seems that I cannot collect summaries from within map_fn. The following code would reproduce the problem:

import tensorflow as tf

summaries = []
def summarize_and_plus_one(inp):
    summaries.append(tf.scalar_summary('inp_%s' % inp, inp))
    inp += 1
    return inp

a = tf.constant([1,2,3,4])
b = tf.map_fn(summarize_and_plus_one, a)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(b))
    sess.run(tf.merge_all_summaries()) # The code would hang here. 


If I unpack first and apply the function without map_fn, the code finishes as expected:

import tensorflow as tf

summaries = []
def summarize_and_plus_one(inp):
    summaries.append(tf.scalar_summary('inp_%s' % inp, inp))
    inp += 1
    return inp

a = tf.constant([1,2,3,4])

res = []
for x in tf.unpack(a):
    res.append(summarize_and_plus_one(x))
b = tf.pack(res)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(b))
    sess.run(tf.merge_all_summaries())


Is this a known issue? It seems the problem is with map_fn (or while_loop).
