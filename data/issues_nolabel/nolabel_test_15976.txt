Describe the problem
When I run the tensorflow camera example on xcode it runs fine but only in dimensions that fit an iphone 4. I changed the build settings, have turned on autolayout, and even tried messing around with the constraints. It seems like no matter what I try the viewcontroller won't get any larger.
