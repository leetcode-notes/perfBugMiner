Is it able to set `allow_growth=True` to environment variables?

Hi all, we a device with 3 gpus, and there are several people who are learning deep-learning.
However, while using tensorflow, all gpus will be used, which causes others not able to calculate.
We know setting config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True in python code can avoid this, but there are always some people who forget to do this.
So I wonder if we can set config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True to default (such as environment variables)? Thanks!
