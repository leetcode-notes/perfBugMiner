Fails to optimize MultivariateNormalFullCovariance. It breaks on Cholesky decomposition . I have cherry picked the mentioned commit to update gradient issue in  MultivariateNormalFullCovariance. Still it fails in optimization

I am trying to optimize a distribution with Mu=Nx4 and covariance matrix = Nx4x4 using MultivariateNormalFullCovariance. The optimization runs for few iterations, loss seems to be reducing (gradients are not exploding !). The code breaks with following
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Got info = 4 for batch index 0, expected info = 0. Debug_info =potrf
[[Node: MultivariateNormalFullCovariance/init/Cholesky = CholeskyT=DT_FLOAT, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0"]]
[[Node: gradients/AddN_30/_49 = _Recv[client_terminated=false, recv_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0", send_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0", send_device_incarnation=1, tensor_name="edge_3080_gradients/AddN_30", tensor_type=DT_FL
I have debugged,  analyzing the covarince,pdf and gradients they all seem to be alright(giving expecting values). Suddenly at one iteration code breaks.
