Windows Environment and TF 1.4.1 - Unavailable through PyPI

Hello dear Tensorflowers,
When running the following code pip install tensorflow==1.4.1, I obtain the following error:
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==1.4.1 (from versions: 1.2.0rc2, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0rc0, 1.3.0rc1, 1.3.0rc2, 1.3.0, 1.4.0rc0, 1.4.0rc1, 1.4.0)
No matching distribution found for tensorflow==1.4.1

This error seem logical because the wheel file does not exist for the windows distribution:

TF 1.4.1 - No Windows Compiled Library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow/1.4.1
TF 1.4.0 - Windows Compiled Library is present: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow/1.4.0

Is the support for the windows platform dropped ? Or maybe some compilation pipeline broke somewhere.
Thanks for your help,
Jonathan
