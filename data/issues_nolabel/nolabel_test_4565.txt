Add camera permission for iOS 10

To avoid shutting the  application down on iOS 10,
adding NSCameraUsageDescription to Info.plist is necessary.

Important: To protect user privacy, an iOS app linked on or after
iOS 10.0, and which accesses the device’s camera, must statically
declare the intent to do so. Include the NSCameraUsageDescription key
in your app’s Info.plist file and provide a purpose string for this
key. If your app attempts to access the device’s camera without a
corresponding purpose string, your app exits.
