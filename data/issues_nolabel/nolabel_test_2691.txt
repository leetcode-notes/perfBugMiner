Gated Feedback LSTM implementation

This PR aims to add a GFLSTM implementation in contrib.
Some of the reasoning for adding a new MultiCell is explained. The new cells cannot be used without a MultiCell, since rnn doesn't know how to pass the state properly.
I am not sure whether splitting all the h's before is better or not, but I think it should use less memory overall on a high number of layers.
The state_is_tuple implementation has not been tested but follows what's being done in the current MultiRNN and LSTM cell so they should be fine.
I'm also open to suggestions for the TODO item, I'm not sure how to handle that.
