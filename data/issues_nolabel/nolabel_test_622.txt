Cannot remove entries from nonexistent

Hello everyone
I am using Anaconda on Mac OS 10.11
I created a new environment with anaconda
conda create -n tensorflow python
Then tried to install tensorflow
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.6.0-py2-none-any.whl
but I faced an error
Installing collected packages: six, setuptools, protobuf, numpy, tensorflow
  Found existing installation: setuptools 19.1.1
**Cannot remove entries from nonexistent file /Users/qdang/anaconda/envs/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth**
How could I install tensorflow with anaconda python 2.7?
Btw, I have CUDA 3.0 (Nvidia 750M) with my Macbook? How could I utilize its power other than running only on CPU mode?
Thanks,
