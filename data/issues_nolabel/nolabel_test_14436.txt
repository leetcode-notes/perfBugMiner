Setting up a Jenkins job for ppc64le for Tensorflow

We are interested in setting up a Jenkins job for ppc64le for Tensorflow  @ http://ci.tensorflow.org/. We can work on providing and configuring a ppc64le slave node that can be hooked in to the Jenkins master. Please let me know if that can be done and if yes, what would be the minimum configuration requirements for the slave node? Thanks.
