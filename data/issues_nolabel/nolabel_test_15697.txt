Describe the problem
Tensorflow transpose is 10000 slower than numpy transpose on my example.
Source code / logs
import numpy as np
a = np.random.randn(*(10, 10, 10, 100, 10, 10, 10))
%timeit np.transpose(a, [3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6])
# 744 ns on my machine
b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((10, 10, 10, 100, 10, 10, 10))) # variable to avoid generating random numbers while measuring time
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
op = tf.transpose(b, [3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]).op
%timeit sess.run(op)
# 7.94 s
