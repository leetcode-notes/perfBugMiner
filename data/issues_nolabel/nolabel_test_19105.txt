unsafe_div op for division by zero

Fix #15706.
Because we have waited for a long time without any response from tensorflowers, we create a PR for further discuss here.
The PR proposes a new private op unsafe_div, which returns 0 (as well as its gradient) when denominator is 0. Please read #15706 for more details.
Please note that we only implement CPU kernel for limited dtypes by now. The PR is still very rudimentary, any feedback/review would be appreciated.
