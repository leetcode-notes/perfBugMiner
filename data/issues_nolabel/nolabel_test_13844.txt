Saving large graphs to S3 fails with InternalError: : Unable to connect to endpoint

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes; modified Tensorflow save/load example code to save a few large tensors to S3
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version:
Git version: v1.3.0-rc1-3504-g27767d8
Tensorflow version: 1.4.0-rc1
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Tesla K80 (12 GiB RAM)
Exact command to reproduce: Run the code in this gist in a Python shell. You'll need access to an S3 bucket for which you have write permissions.

Describe the problem
I'm trying to save a large (~380 MB) graph to S3, but my call to tf.Saver.save() crashes after ~1 min with what appears to be an AWS SDK error (InternalError: : Unable to connect to endpoint).
If the error is indeed AWS related, it'd be helpful to wrap it in something to indicate that the error isn't coming from tensorflow. Here's the stacktrace:

InternalError (see above for traceback): : Unable to connect to endpoint

If I run the same code but checkpoint to my local filesystem the save op runs without error.
The error also only seems to occur for large graphs (running the linked gist with smaller/fewer tensors works)
