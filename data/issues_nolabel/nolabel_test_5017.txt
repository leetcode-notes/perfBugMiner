TF Quit working with  /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found, I then reinstalled

I had it working, and then went to use it once again (after some "normal" Ubuntu system updates one of which may have been bazel?) And I got the traceback with the CXXABI_1.3.8' not found
So how should I remove the whole install and try again? or something easier?

Not sure what got updated but I got this message when importing tensorflow (which I had installed from source. So I reinstalled from source,, and got the same result but with the added message about should not run from source tree??
