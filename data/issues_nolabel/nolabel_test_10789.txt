quantize_graph error in simple graph

when my graph is as follows, it will fail to quantize, the error info is AssertionError: Failed to quantized constant ones_1 of type
x = tf.ones((1000,1),'int32') **ones = tf.ones((1, 100), "int32")** x = tf.reshape(x, shape=(-1,1))
when i change graph to the following, it works:
x = tf.ones((1000,1),'int32') **ones = tf.ones((1, 100), "int32") ones = tf.reshape(ones, shape=(1,-1))** x = tf.reshape(x, shape=(-1,1))
is there anyone can help me to find out the reason, because even i change my code and successfully generated quantized graph, the graph is wrong when importing, BTW my graph is much more complex than the code above.
