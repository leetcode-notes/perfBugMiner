error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file

Hello, now my cuda is 7.5 , so I install tf from the source, but when I run the command 'bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg', it shows error:
Sun Mar 5 02:09:40 CST 2017 : === Using tmpdir: /tmp/tmp.4Bm642hjyI ~/ztgong/dl-tools/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles ~/ztgong/dl-tools/tensorflow ~/ztgong/dl-tools/tensorflow /tmp/tmp.4Bm642hjyI ~/ztgong/dl-tools/tensorflow Sun Mar 5 02:09:41 CST 2017 : === Building wheel error: can't copy 'tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file
I still not fix this error, how to solve it?
