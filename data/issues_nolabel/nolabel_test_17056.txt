tf.reduce_min([inf, nan]).eval() == inf, should be nan

Describe the problem
tf.reduce_min and tf.reduce_max do not propagate nans correctly.  E.g.,
>>> tf.reduce_min([inf, nan]).eval()
inf

but the correct answer (the one most useful for debugging) is nan.  This is presumably due to a backwards comparison, similar to the old tf.nn.relu(nan) == 0 bug that @alexalemi found.
