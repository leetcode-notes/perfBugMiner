Dynamic ksize and strides with MaxPool

This fix is the renewed effort to fix #4746 with Jenkins failures fixed. (the previous PR was #9514).
This fix tries to fix the issue raised in #4746 where ksize and strides is static (attr) with max_pool (and avg_pool).
This fix changes ksize and strides to input tensor with MaxPoolV2 so that it is dynamic now.
This fix add MaxPoolV2 but hasn't points nn_ops.max_pool to gen_nn_ops.max_pool_v2 yet. It tries to following the same api workflow as PR #10840 (3 weeks before API changes).
This fix fixes #4746.
