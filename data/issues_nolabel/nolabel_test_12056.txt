Implement CRF decode (Viterbi decode) for tensor

Currently, Tensorflow doesn't support CRF decoding (Viterbi decoding) for tensor. Although tf.contrib.crf.viterbi_decode function can do CRF decoding, it can only be used at test time, since it accepts Numpy arrays as inputs.
Implementing CRF decoding for tensor benefits us a lot, as this makes our model more portable (e.g. we can freeze model, save it to a .pb file and then load it in Golang at test time).
This PR implements CRF decoding for tensor and adds test code for it.
This PR's change is compatible with current API.
