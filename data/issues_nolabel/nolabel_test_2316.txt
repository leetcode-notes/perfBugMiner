Try to build label_image:main.cc on Android

1.If I build  tensorflow_jni.cc with the BUILD file in label_image,I added android_binary.it ask me to compile with -std=c++.because the ndk r10e running with GCC4.9.I donot know how to set -std=c++11.
2.If I build it with .mk.and copy the .h files in bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/cc/ops,like array_ops.h etc,  to tensorflow folder,setted include like this
`#include "tensorflow/cc/ops/array_ops.h"
include "tensorflow/cc/ops/const_op.h"
include "tensorflow/cc/ops/data_flow_ops.h"
include "tensorflow/cc/ops/image_ops.h"`...
it give me:
jni/./tensorflow_jni.cc:132: error: undefined reference to 'tensorflow::ops::Cast(tensorflow::NodeBuilder::NodeOut, tensorflow::DataType, tensorflow::GraphDefBuilder::Options const&)'
for every tensorflow::ops:: method.it seems,ndk have found the method ,but not compile?
3.Did any guies build label_image:main.cc on Android?
the android demo on tensorflow does not working will with my own graph,retrained by image_retraining .
