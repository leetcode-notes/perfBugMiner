[XLA/tfcompile] Add Env::CreateUniqueFileName and use it in SaveGraph

Split part of tensorflow::Env::LocalTempFilename into tensorflow::Env::CreateTempFilename so that it can be used in SaveGraph.
This PR is to replace #15335.
I am terrible in creating descriptive function name, better name suggestion for CreateTempFilename is welcomed.
/cc @jlebar.
