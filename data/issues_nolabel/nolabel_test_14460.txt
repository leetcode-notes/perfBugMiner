Apparent incorrect behavior from resize_to_range() in models/preprocessor.py

From the comments for resize_to_range():
The output size can be described by two cases:

If the image can be rescaled so its minimum dimension is equal to the
provided value without the other dimension exceeding max_dimension,
then do so.
Otherwise, resize so the largest dimension is equal to max_dimension.

This logic would yield the wrong behavior for images with an aspect ratio near 1.  For instance, if we had a 1200x1200 image, and we had settings min_dimension = 600 and max_dimension = 1024, it seems that the desired behavior would be to rescale the image to 1024x1024.  Instead, following the logic above, the image would be rescaled to 600x600.
Am I missing something?
