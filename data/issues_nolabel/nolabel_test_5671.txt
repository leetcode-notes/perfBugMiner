'tensorflow.core.framework.types_pb2' has no attribute 'DT_RESOURCE'

I successfully built the PIP package (at HEAD) on Windows with cmake.  When I tried to import it, I met several errors that all boil down to the following:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.core.framework.types_pb2' has no attribute 'DT_RESOURCE'
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.core.framework.types_pb2' has no attribute 'DT_RESOURCE_REF'
