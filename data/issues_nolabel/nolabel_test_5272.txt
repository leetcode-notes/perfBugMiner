Tensorflow stop running while running "sess=tf.Session()"

I am running tensorflow on ubuntu14.04 server using GPU and I had successuflly run the demo in the tutorial about mnist a few days ago.
Today, I run the same demo but to find it get stucked. I find out that I can import tensorflow successfully, but every time I run "sess=tf.Session()" the program will stop. It is strange that neither error information sent back nor the python quit. The cursor just stop there, enen "ctrl+c" does not work.
As the server I installed tensorflow is public, I suspect that someone had changed something on the server. But I do not know. How can I fix it?
