Cleanup the file structures in tensorflow/core/kernels

This is a feature request about the file structure in tensorflow/core/kernels .
The problem
There is a CPU/GPU mingled source codes in the OpKernel directory.
This file structure seems that it is complicated to search the CPU/GPU independent code.
How about to cleanup the file structures?
I think the file structures (tensorflow/compiler/xla/service) on XLA is great approach because it is more pluggable and less dependency with another device.
And I would like to contribute if you accept this idea.
Thanks
