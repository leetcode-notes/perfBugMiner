[CMake] Default values of some options are not properly set

tensorflow_PATH_CUDNN_STATIC_LIB and tensorflow_PATH_NCCL_STATIC_LIB are supposed to be configured as the value of tensorflow_PATH_STATIC_LIB by default.
However, because cmake options's default values are either OFF or ON, this doesn't work as supposed.
I'll post a Pull Request addressing this issue in a few minutes.
