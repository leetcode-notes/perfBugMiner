miss file after install tensorflow

After installing tensorflow, I found only one tensorflow folder in the path tensorflow/inlcude. In fact, it shoud consist of many other folders such as third_party, google, Eigen and so on. I don't known the reason why I could not find these folders. The way which I used to install tensorflow is "sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl"
Thanks
