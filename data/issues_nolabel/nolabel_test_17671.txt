Describe the problem
When I write delt to get gradients of pi with respect to v, I get the gradients. Same for rem with respect to v. However, when I ask for gradients of z with respect to v, I get a matrix of 0s, which is clearly not the gradient as z is just the concatenation of pi and rem, both of which have non-zero gradients. Why is this happening?
Source code / logs
def latent_space(v):
	# Calculate pi
	with tf.name_scope('pi'):
		def fn(previous_output,current_input):
			[stick,remaining] = previous_output
			i = current_input
			stick = v[:,i]*remaining
			remaining *= (1-v[:,i])
			return [stick,remaining]

		elems = tf.Variable(tf.range(latent-1))
		[pi,rem] = tf.scan(fn,elems,initializer=[tf.ones([bs]),tf.ones([bs])])
		rem = tf.reshape(rem[-1,:],[1,bs])
		z = tf.concat([pi,rem],axis=0)
		z = tf.transpose(z)
		delt = tf.gradients(z,v)
	return z,delt
