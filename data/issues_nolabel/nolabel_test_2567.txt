Enable segment reduction ops for complex numbers

I've enabled segment reduction ops for complex 64 and complex128 on the CPU,
in order to bring their behavior in line with the regular reduction ops.
Only sum and prod reductions have been enabled, as min and max are not
appropriate and mean would require changes to the code and is probably
not worth it.
This fixes #2255
