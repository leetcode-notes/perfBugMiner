float16 depthwise conv support

It seems that the current implementation of depthwise convolution doesn't support half-precision :
/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/gen_nn_ops.pyc in depthwise_conv2d_native(input, filter, strides, padding, data_format, name)
TypeError: Value passed to parameter 'input' has DataType float16 not in list of allowed values: float32, float64
Any chances of having float16 support for this important op anytime soon? So training on P100s would be faster.
