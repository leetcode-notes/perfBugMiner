Introduce a new tool/function to visualize a pb model as requested by #8854

Issue #8854 asked for a tool to easily visualize .pb models as graphs. I pointed out it was possible to do with Tensorboard so i've created a function to allow someone to pass a .pb model and a tensorboard log directory to then view the imported .pb graph.
I guess this is a temporary measure until a decision is made on creating something a bit more friendly.
Also, For some reason I think that this PR is including some previously merged commits and I don't know how to get rid of them on github! I thought i'd sync'd everything but i'm a bit rubbish at this. I guess those can be safely ignored. Thanks
