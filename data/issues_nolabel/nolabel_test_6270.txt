Non-backwards compatible change in moving_averages.assign_moving_average

A zero_debias argument has recently been added to moving_averages.assign_moving_average. zero_debias=True significantly changes the behavior of moving_averages.assign_moving_average, in an unexpected way.
The default value for zero_debias is True. It should be False. The True default breaks existing code (it was breaking Keras), and it also a bad default value on its own because it introduces unexpected behavior (one would expect assign_moving_average to merely assign a moving average, i.e. return the equivalent of an assign_add op. Instead it creates weights, etc).
