How to implement dynamic network with TensorFlow ?

Hi, I am trying to implement a dynamic network, which is able to change the network structure according to the input data. Here is an example  https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02799
I wonder it that possible to use TensorFlow to implement dynamic network?
I think we may need to use placeholder to control the network?
Thank you very much.
