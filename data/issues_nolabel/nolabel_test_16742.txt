Allow passing Saver write_version to 'evaluation_once' and 'evaluatio…

…n_loop'
Thanks @tedhtchang for the commit 2a16133 to add checkpoint file prefix check with default to SaverDef.V2.
However there are some pre-trained slim models which stored in SaverDef.V1 format. This will broken eval_image_classifier.py for these models since there is no way to choose in slim/evaluation.py.
So a parameter write_version is added for evaluation_once and evaluation_loop which allows programs like eval_image_classifier.py could tell which format the checkpoint uses.
