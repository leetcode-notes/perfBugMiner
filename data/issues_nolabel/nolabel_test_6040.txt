avoid tf.int32-only call to gather in moments, thereby keeping kernel on GPU

Fixes #6027 (tested locally)
@vincentvanhoucke
Sorry for being late here. I think this might be a slightly better fix. I tested this locally, and it did resolve the cpu-gather behavior that I was seeing.
@poxvoculi
I thought about it for a while, and I couldn't figure out how to avoid tf.gather completely in a reasonable manner. I hope that this patch is acceptable.
