Fix #13731 by adding HistogramdFixedWidth in hidden_ops.txt and create the python wrapper

This fix fixes the build breaks in #13731. The issue was caused by the fact that API compatibility requires a default value for nbins=100 while the test utility code in contrib need to pass a tensor (not through attribute).
This fix adds HistogramdFixedWidth in hidden_ops.txt so that histogram_fixed_width is hidden in gen_math_ops.py. Then histogram_fixed_width calls the hidden gen_math_ops._histogram_fixed_width.
In this way, both api compatibility and test utility code in contrib requires no changes.
See (comment) #13731 (comment) for reference.
