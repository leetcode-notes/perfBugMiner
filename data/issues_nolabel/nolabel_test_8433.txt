Cannot find attention functions

Hi, i am trying to implement attention rnn and want to use https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/attention_decoder_fn_inference and other attention methods from attention_decoder_fn.py . However i cannot find it here on github ...
When this functionality will be available?
Why is it in api web page but not in the repo?
