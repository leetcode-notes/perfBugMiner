Fast python protocol buffers?

This might be a better question for the protobuf team, but is there any way to get fast python protocol buffers with TensorFlow? I have tried bazel build --copt=-DPYTHON_PROTO2_CPP_IMPL_V2 but running with PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION='cpp' gives the following error:
