Fixes issues in tf.contrib.keras.utils.Progbar

In version 1.5 of Tensorflow, if Progbar's target is set to None, internally it gets set to -1.
Changed code that referenced self.target is not None to self.target != -1, self.target is None to self.target == -1.
Also, ProgBar is printing twice as reported here #16538. Fixed duplicate text
