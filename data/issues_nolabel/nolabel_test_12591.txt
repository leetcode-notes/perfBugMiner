Error: tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InternalError: Unable to get element from the feed as bytes.

I have met this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InternalError: Unable to get element from the feed as bytes.

Background:
Firstly, I have a simple cnn program, and I build a model.ckpt files.
Secondly, I make be ckpt converting to pb.
Thridly, I used ckpt model doing predict and pb model doing predict.
In simple cnn program, ckpt and pb all do normal predict by using predict = sess.run(pred, feed_dict={x: imgs, is_train:False}) .
However, when I using upper method to cnn-rnn program, I could have a normal predict result using ckpt model file, but it had a tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InternalError: Unable to get element from the feed as bytes. problem using pb.
I can't solve this problem, I need help!
Please!
Thanks!
