LSTMBlockFusedCell  does not support using  DropoutWrapper

I am trying to use DropoutWrapper with LSTMBlockFusedCell as follows:
cell = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockFusedCell(num_units,forget_bias) 
cell = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(cell,dropout)

I get an exception that the LSTMBlockFusedCell is not an RNNCell
Message: The parameter cell is not a RNNCell. Which is raised form _like_rnncell during DropoutWrapper initialization.
It is checking for those proprieties on the cell:
""Checks that a given object is an RNNCell by using duck typing."""
conditions = [hasattr(cell, "output_size"), hasattr(cell, "state_size"),                 hasattr(cell, "zero_state"), callable(cell)]  LSTMBlockFusedCell does not have output_size , state_size or zero_state properties.
Should LSTMBlockFusedCell  act like RNNCell to allow using various wrappers?
