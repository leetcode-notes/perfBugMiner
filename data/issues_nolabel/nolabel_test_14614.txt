Which c++ source code Should I modify to allocate GPU memory dynamically?

I am using Spark with tensorflow. Spark make many tensorflow process, so I want tensorflow to allocate GPU memory dynamically.
Adding the below code is not working for me
config = tf.ConfigProto() 
config.gpu_options.allow_growth=True 
sess = tf.Session(config=config)

Although I found  the way to set gpu memory fraction in 'tensorflow/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc' ,
I want to set 'allow_growth' in c++ source.
Which part shoud I modify?
