Issues #2099 has become a problem again: using empty variables

The code below fails with "Attempting to use uninitialized value Variable".  See #2099. I presume that this was fixed in the past but regressed subsequently. I understand that the past stance was that it is fine to use variables with shapes that contain a 0 in one of the dimensions.
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
empty = np.zeros(shape=(0, 0) )
a = tf.Variable(empty)
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
sess.run(tf.reduce_sum(a))
