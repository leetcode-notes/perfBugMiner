Allow build_all_ios.sh to build just one arch

This change allows build_all_ios.sh to take an -a flag with a
specific arch so you dont have to waste time building unwanted
architectures (32bit etc)
TEST: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh  #builds fat lib
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh -a "arm64" #only arm64
