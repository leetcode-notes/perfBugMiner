Doubt with sharing variable

http://tensorflow.org/how_tos/variable_scope/index.md
I was experiencing serious difficulties at first and believed we're endeavoring to utilize the same weights for both of the conv layers. It didn't help that the definition for "variables_dict" just unequivocally expresses the presence for the weights for the primary conv layer, persuading that the weights of the 2 layers are really shared also.
