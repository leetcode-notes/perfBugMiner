bazel 0.4 support for tensorflow

I am trying to build the tensorflow from source. I get errors like "bazel-out/host/bin/external/grpc/grpc_cpp_plugin: program not found or is not executable". But builds successfully. If bazel 0.4 is not supported, its a documentation bug here https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html to mention that bazel latest version should be downloaded. I could successfully build with bazel 0.3.x.
