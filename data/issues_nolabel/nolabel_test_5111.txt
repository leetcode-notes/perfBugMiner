android example with a new model which has a large .pb file(180mb)

hi guys
i tried to run the android example with a new model which has a large .pb file(180mb), and i get the error.
10-21 15:32:02.172 19751-19816/org.tensorflow.demo A/native: jni_utils.cc:128 Check failed: message->ParseFromArray(memory, data_size)
10-21 15:32:02.172 19751-19816/org.tensorflow.demo A/libc: Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 in tid 19816 (ImageListener)
i thought it's a limitation of reading file with native code.
does anyone get the same problem or have a way to deal it?
thank for your time.
