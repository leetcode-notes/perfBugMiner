Add GPU and CPU implementation of `tf.histogram_fixed_width`.

This fix adds the GPU and CPU implementation of tf.histogram_fixed_width.
The previous implementation was done in python. This fix adds C++ kernel for GPU and CPU.
The GPU version uses CUB's API cub::DeviceHistogram::HistogramRange. The range is  constructed from the upper/lower limit and step size. (HistogramEven could not be used directly as the edge case is different).
The CPU version uses a transform to map the input into the bucket index, then did a bin count.
Note the output type of int64 on GPU is not supported yet as atomicAdd has no int64 at the moment.
