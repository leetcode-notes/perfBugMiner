Potential Memory Leak with Session Closing

Bug: When repeatedly creating and closing sessions on a GPU or CPU (on 0.6.0 release and Jan 5 dev version), memory appears to leak as the python process continually grows in memory usage. Additionally, the time to execute continues to grow.
Expected behaviour: Once a session is closed, resources allocated should be freed or overwritten.
The following code illustrates the issue with a minimal graph created:
for i in range(0,10000000):
t0 = time.clock()
sess = tf.Session()

a = tf.placeholder("int16",name = 'a')
y=tf.identity(a,name='y')

sess.run(y,feed_dict={a:3})
sess.close()

print time.clock() - t0

The same issue happens even if I use a constant or variable instead of placeholder.
Thanks!
