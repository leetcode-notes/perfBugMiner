Enable test case for float64 with conv1d

The float64 for conv2d support has been added to tensorflow in e3468b5. (Thanks brianwa84!)
Since conv1d implementation invokes conv2d, the float64 support for conv1d is supported now as well.
This fix adds the test case for float64 support of conv1d and removes the TODO.
This fix fixes #19175.
