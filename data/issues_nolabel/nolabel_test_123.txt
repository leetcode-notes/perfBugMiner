Cant install, Mac - El Capitan - not a supported wheel

I try using this command in terminal
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl
but i get "tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform."
I dont know what I did wrong, i am pretty sure pip is up to date, and I just downloaded homebrew for this...
I am using python with the anaconda package if that effects anything?
I have no idea what I am doing here, help please.
