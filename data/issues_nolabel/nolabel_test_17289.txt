TFLite 'Minimum' Operator

I have a fine-tuned MobileNet model, in frozen graph format. I ran Toco to create a TFLite model, but got the following error:
Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: TensorFlowMinimum.
Examining the ops in the graph, I see ones like mobilenet_1.00_224/conv1_relu/Minimum.
