Tensorflow profiling overhead

The profiling mechanism (which by the way really deserves to be documented...) can add a prohibitive large computational overhead to the execution. Specifically, my training script runs 10 times slower with profiling. I stripped it down to a small self-contained example and the slowdown became just 3x, but I think this is bad enough.
