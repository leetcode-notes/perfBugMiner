Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1 in when building using nvidia docker cuda8 image

We built tensorflow on nvidia-docker image nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel
"""
However, when using the package we built, we run into this problem:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:105] Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64:
"""
In this special Dockerfile, we are using whatever LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined by nvidia docker.
It looks like we are looking specificly for the file libcuda.so.1
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc#L80
And it looks like we switched to doing this due to:
#2865
However, libcuda.so.1 is not linked/made available by nvidia-docker in the docker image.
Side note: it seems to be not available in our docker images based on 7.5, but that one somehow works.
No idea how.
@flx42 could you help us shed some light into this?
