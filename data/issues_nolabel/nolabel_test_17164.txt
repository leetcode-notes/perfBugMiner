Catch / recover from CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM

Hi all,

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Win7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): VC14_64
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8 / 6
GPU model and memory: Quadro K2000M
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

I am using the C++ API to load and execute trained models.
I sometimes experience a problem regarding the ensemble of CuDNN and tensorflow:
When I invoke Session::Run and the input tensor I am providing is too small for the network (which is fully convolutional and thus has no fixed input extents given), CuDNN crashes with CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM.
Is there any way to catch this as an exception or somehow recover from that failure? Or is there a way to determine whether the given tensor extent will lead to such an error before I actually throw it at the network?
Thanks!
