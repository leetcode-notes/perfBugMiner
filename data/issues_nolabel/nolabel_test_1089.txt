Enable GPU reduction for doubles

I was just trying to apply reduce_sum to a float64 array on a GPU and noticed that the reduction operators are currently only defined for float32.
Is there a reason for limiting the type?
I've added reduction definitions for double in this PR.
I've also played with adding reduction ops for all realnumbertypes (the reduction ops in core/ops/math_ops.py specify numbertype).
I can add them to this PR if there's interest.
