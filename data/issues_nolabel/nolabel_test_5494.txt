Refactor cuda_configure to better support for different CUDA installations

This change implements cuda and cudnn version autodetection via running
nvcc --version and reading cudnn.h. As a result, TF_CUDA_VERSION and
TF_CUDNN_VERSION no longer have to be set. If TF_CUDA_VERSION and
TF_CUDNN_VERSION are set but do not match the detected versions,
cuda_configure will fail.
After the cuda and cudnn versions are detected, cuda_configure then
attempts to find the needed cuda and cudnn libraries in a set of known
installation directories.
