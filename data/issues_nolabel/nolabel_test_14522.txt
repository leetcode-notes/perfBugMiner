bazel build: can't install tensor flow

I did "bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package"
and this is what I got:
"ERROR: /home/simon/Downloads/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/BUILD:259:1: Illegal ambiguous match on configurable attribute "copts" in //tensorflow/contrib/rnn:gen_gru_ops_py_wrappers_cc:
@local_config_cuda//cuda:using_clang
@local_config_cuda//cuda:using_nvcc
Multiple matches are not allowed unless one is unambiguously more specialized.

What do I Do?
