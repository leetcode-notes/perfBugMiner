[TF:XLA] XLA does not recognize symbol Polly.

System information

Problem description
I have written my custom build file to integrate Polly into XLA's LLVM build. I have included a dependency to @llvm//:polly in my tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/cpu/BUILD file under the compiler_functor rule (Since this is the file with the LLVM PassManagerBuilder defined).
I also added the header
#include "external/llvm/tools/polly/include/polly/RegisterPasses.h"

in this file.
Somehow, this does not seem to be enough for XLA to recognize Polly. When I add -
polly::registerPollyPasses(...)

to this file, it fails to compile with
ERROR: Symbol polly was not declared here

I am unable to fix this (possibly linking) issue.
@hawkinsp - Could you please take a look at this?
