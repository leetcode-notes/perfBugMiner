How to add an external java library(.jar) into Bazel build path.

Describe the problem clearly
I follow the rule in Bazel website to add a JAR into Bazel build path, this is my script:
...
android_binary(
...
deps = [
":tensorflow_native_libs",
"//tensorflow/contrib/android:android_tensorflow_inference_java",
":libs/nd4j-api-0.8.0.jar"
],
)
...
but the log says that my JAR is misplaced.
How should I do to add a JAR library into build path or do I miss out something ?
Thanks,
