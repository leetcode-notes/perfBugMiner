improve error message when a category is empty

When a category has no images, the error message doesn't display which label causes it:
2016-09-01 06:08:13.722176: Step 0: Train accuracy = 64.0%
2016-09-01 06:08:13.722418: Step 0: Cross entropy = 1.541732
CRITICAL:tensorflow:Category has no images - validation.

This change includes the label in the error message so it reads
CRITICAL:tensorflow:Category flowers has no images - validation
