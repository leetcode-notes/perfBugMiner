tensorflow-android library 1.4.0-rc0 seems to contain tensorflow 1.3.0-rc2

For my work I require the new String Tensor feature introduced for the Java API in tensorflow 1.4. I tested my network with my Java code on my Desktop which works fine (using org.tensorflow:tensorflow:1.4.0-rc0).
However, when I use the same code in an Android project (using org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:1.4.0-rc0), I get the following error leading me to the guess that the wrong version was packaged:
10-18 16:33:33.987 21288-22070/test.android.fisheye W/System.err: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: non-scalar DataType.STRING tensors are not supported yet (version 1.3.0-rc2). Please file a feature request at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new

I also downloaded the org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:1.4.0-rc0 from maven central and had a look at the class files. They look like the class files from the 1.3.0 version.
Furthermore, when looking at the Tensor and Tensorflow classes, you can see that the version displayed in the error message above, is actually read from the native library.
Do you agree, or did I miss something? If you do agree, can you please upload a real 1.4.0-rc0 to maven central?
