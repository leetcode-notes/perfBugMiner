NaN propagation for GPU pooling ops

Attention @zheng-xq

Changes the custom fwd maxpooling kernel to propagate NaNs. This
makes it match the behavior of CUDNN, and ensures that CUDNN's
bwd maxpooling kernel behaves as expected (propagating NaNs).
Previous behavior can be restored with environment variable
TF_ENABLE_MAXPOOL_NANPROP=0.
Changes the GPU bwd maxpool op tests to expect propagated NaNs
(matching the behavior of the CPU path).
