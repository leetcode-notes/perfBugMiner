caffe/tensorflow/mxnet: converter from python to c++

https://github.com/rmekdma/python_misc/blob/master/caffe/caffe_ftr.py
I need to do some system integration in C++. Given the above caffe code,
how can I track the C++ code being used behind each caffe/tensorflow/mxnet function in python?
Can I generate the C++ code so that I can compile and run?
What is the python wrapper used by caffe/tensorflow/mxnet? ctype, boot:python or swig?
Similarly, it will be interesting to know whether I can do the same from python to c++ in tensorflow , mxnet or other python binding code, if it is easier to do it in tensorflow.
