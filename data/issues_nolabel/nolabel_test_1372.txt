Compilation error: missing dependency declarations ... external/re2/util/rune.cc

Environment info
Operating System: CentOS 6.7
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: eda89e9
Steps to reproduce

./configure (CUDA enabled)
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --verbose_failures --genrule_strategy=standalone --spawn_strategy=standalone //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

What have you tried?

Using --genrule_strategy=standalone --spawn_strategy=standalone as possible solutions from other errors that seem related, but this doesn't work.

Other Info
I was able to compile Bazel with older libc, and now I'm hoping I can compile TensorFlow on this server. Any help will be very much appreciated.
