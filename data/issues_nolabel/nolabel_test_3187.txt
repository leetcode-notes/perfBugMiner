fixed link to tensorboard readme in image retraining how-to

I noticed my update to the image retraining how-to had a broken link to the TensorBoard README when viewing the content at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html#visualizing-the-retraining-with-tensorboard. Therefore, I updated the relative link to be an absolute link so people will be able to browse to it regardless of which page they're viewing the tutorial (tensorflow.org or github).
