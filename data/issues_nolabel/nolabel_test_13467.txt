cannot create an object of the class tf.layers.Dense()

I want to create an object of the class tf.layers.Dense(), but don't want to do the feedforward step immediately (i.e. not tf.layers.dense(input, units)). Because I want to first declare these modules/layers in a class, and then to have several member functions apply1(x, y), apply2(x,y) to use these layers. But when I did in tensorflow tf.layers.Dense(units), it returned:
layer = tf.layers.Dense(100)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Dense'
How can I fix that?
Thanks
