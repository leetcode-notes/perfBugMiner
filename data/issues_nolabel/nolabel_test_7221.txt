Linking of rule '@protobuf//:internal/_api_implementation.so' failed:

I am trying to build tensorflow v0.12.0 from source with bazel 0.4.3 and failed with this error:
ERROR: /ui/ncsa/qiyuelu1/.cache/bazel/_bazel_qiyuelu1/ce8d1fb9ff1b7a9dbbd225fe7f0c6f52/external/protobuf/BUILD:579:1: Linking of rule '@protobuf//:internal/_api_implementation.so' failed: link_dynamic_library.sh failed: error executing command

  exec env - \

I searched online and found github bazelbuild/bazel #1867 and tensorflow/tensorflow issue #2266, #5617 and #5616, but it seems the changes suggested in these issue have already been implemented in the source code of version 0.12.0. I am not sure why this problem still exists.
Environment info
Operating System: RHEL 6.8
CUDA: 8.0
cuDNN: 5.1
Java: 1.8.0_112
gcc: 4.9.2
bazel: 0.4.3
tensorflow: v0.12.0 (Latest commit c62a66b on Dec 19, 2016)
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried tensorflow version 0.12.head and v1.0.1-rc0, both of them can be built successfully. However, we do need this specific version 0.12.0.
