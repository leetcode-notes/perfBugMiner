Different GPU memory not all allocated

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
win10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.1
Python version:
3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
cuda8.0,cudnn5.5
GPU model and memory:
GTX Titan 6GB, GTX 1080Ti 11GB

Describe the problem
Note that tensorflow will allocate tensor/op to all available gpus, but i only got 1080Ti occupied, I wonder if it's a bug or tensorflow doesn't support different gpu models.
