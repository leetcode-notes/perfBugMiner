[Import Error] Tensorflow is looking for wrong shared library; libnvidia-fatbinaryloader.so.375.88

System information

OS Platform and Distribution:  Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: Binary
TensorFlow version: 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 6
GPU model and memory: GTX 840M, 2GB
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

When ever I try to import tensorflow (1.3.0), I encounter a ImportError where the system is unable to locate the shared library libnvidia-fatbinaryloader.so.375.88. I've looked in /usr/lib/nvidia-375 and found that another version of the .so exists (375.66).
The issue is resolved if I downgrade to tensorflow version 1.2.1
