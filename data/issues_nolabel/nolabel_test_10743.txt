don't lock markdown version and bring CI deps install script in sync with setup.py

This markdown version lock could cause versioning conflict for downstream (e.g. if requirements are compiled and resolved by pip-compile). Wondering If there's a reason to lock this version
Seems someone pushed 1.2.0 to PYPI and it cause some dependency conflict.
