Weights are nan, loss is computed fine and gradients are too small

I have been researching about this over the INTERNET for a very long time. But I still do not know where my problem lies. I am finetuning a siamese fashioned vgg. And the problem is that even after first iteration distance calcualted is fine, loss calculated is fine but the gradients are too small(which is a problem) and the weights that are updated are nan. I do not understand what the problem is.
In the network, I have removed fully connected layers and the output from the last pooling layer is the input to the distance function. Here is my code. I have only attached important snippets of the code which I hope help understand the architecture.
PS: stackoverflow was of no help that is why I am posting it here.
PPS: I have attached snapshot of gradients as well
