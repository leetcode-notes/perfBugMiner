configure script hardcodes location of cuda that makes it fail on OSX

Cuda installation on OSX is at $CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH/lib (not lib64), and on OSX the shared libraries are end in .dylib (not .so).
  if [ -e "$CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH/lib64/libcudart.so.7.0" ]; then
    break
  fi
  echo "Invalid path to CUDA 7.0 toolkit. ${CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH}/lib64/libcudart.so.7.0 cannot be found"
