DNN Classifier producing Blue Screen of Death every time

Hi,
When running inputs 9 10 and 11 from the below notebook, I get a blue screen of death every time?
https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/10_introduction_to_artificial_neural_networks.ipynb
I'm using:
Python ver 3.5.3
Tensorflow 1.2.1
Running on a windows 7 pro machine
Any tips on how to resolve this?
