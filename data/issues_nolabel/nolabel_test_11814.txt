Fix error with default python path selection

When the env var USE_DEFAULT_PYTHON_LIB_PATH is set to 1, and there isn't PYTHON_LIB_PATH set, then the configure used to select the first entry that python itself returned.
this was broken recently. I suspect that it was a mistake rather than a deliberate choice.
