How to search similiar images?

This is not an issue, but i don't know where to ask this. I just get started with tensor flow and it's interesting to me. I know tensorflow will help classifying images, but in my case, i need to search similiar images. I read that google using tensorflow for search image in photos app. So how to make tensorflow return similiar image?
Thank you very much
