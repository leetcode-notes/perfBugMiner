Add BUILD file and test case for "fact" user op

Current example op defined in tensorflow/core/user_ops/fact.cc is causing a "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'fact'" error using the following BUILD file and python code under tensorflow/core/user_ops:
BUILD file:
load("//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl", "tf_custom_op_library")
tf_custom_op_library(
name = "fact.so",
srcs = ["fact.cc"],
)
Python code:
import tensorflow as tf
fact_module = tf.load_op_library('fact.so')
with tf.Session():
print(fact_module.fact().eval())
Is this due to "fact" possibly being a reserved keyword in tensorflow? If yes, this PR will fix this issue by calling the op as my_fact instead of fact.
If it makes sense, I can also add the BUILD file and this python driver code under tensorflow/core/user_ops
