Error while trying out mnist_softmax

Hello everyone,
I am using python3.4.2 and tensorflow-1.0.0
I am getting started with tensorflow and so was trying out MNIST For ML Beginners (https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_softmax.py)
I am getting the following output:
$ python3 test2.py --data_dir=./MNIST_data

If someone could help me fix the Error in 'python3': free() problem.
