Anyway to save the session as an object but not a file?

Hi,
I know that the tensorflow can save all variables into a file as a checkpoint
Is there anyway to save the tensor flow session into an object? like
a=Queue()
a.put( sess.status({%variables%}) )  #or maybe a.put( tf.train.status({%variables%}) )
So when I want to restore a session status. I just do a.get()
Is that possible?
Thank you.
