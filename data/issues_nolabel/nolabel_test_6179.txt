How to localize the position of object by using tensorflow

The ILSVRC competition held by imagenet includes Object localization and Object detection and other tasks.
How did the convolutional neural network solve the localization problem?
I can only find tutorials on classification task.
I think it is proper to add an example of localization in tensorflow tutorial.
