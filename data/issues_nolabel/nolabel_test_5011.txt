Remove duplicated arg description in doc string

sequence_length description is repeated in bidirectional_dynamic_rnn documentation. It looks like it split the dtype description into two sections. I believe that dtype is required if either initial state is not provided (like bidirectional_rnn) and that these changes should reflect that.
