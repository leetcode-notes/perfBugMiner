Inconsistency in the accepted shape/data_format of Input Tensor to Conv2D in documentation.

Problem
The Tensorflow Layers Guide at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers specifies:

The methods in the layers module for creating convolutional and pooling layers for two-dimensional image data expect input tensors to have a shape of [batch_size, image_width, image_height, channels]

While, the inline documentation specified for conv2D (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/layers/convolutional.py#L444) mentions the following valid data_formats:

data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first.
The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape
(batch, height, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to
inputs with shape (batch, channels, height, width)

Moreover, nn.bias_add, avg_pool2d (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py#L99) etc. also accept [...,height, width...] but using different strings/methodology.

inputs: A 4-D tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, channels] if
data_format is NHWC, and [batch_size, channels, height, width] if
data_format is NCHW.

Thus; shouldn't https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers be updated and the valid data_format values for Convolutional Layers be changed?
