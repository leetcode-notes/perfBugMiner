Fix #5143: Remove dependencies on test libraries

tensorflow/python:tf_session_helper has dependencies on some
test libraries. I don't believe these dependencies should have
ever existed.
Regardless, removing them now. In particular because recent
changes to bazel
(bazelbuild/bazel@5f026f9)
suggest that these dependencies will cause build failures in the next
release of bazel (or if bazel is built from source).
