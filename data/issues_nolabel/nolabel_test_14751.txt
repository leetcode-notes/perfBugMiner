update how_tos/reading_data to use Dataset API

Since the Dataset API moved from .contrib.data into .data (core) update the MNIST example to use Dataset over queues.
This was the first page I've found when searching how to best get data into TF and I thought it should reflect the current best practice. Also, if I understand correctly, queues might be deprecated in favor of Datasets some time in the future.
