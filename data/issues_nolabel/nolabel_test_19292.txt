tf.layers.Layer does not preserver the keras metadata entered into a tensor/placeholder

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8.0-rc1
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.12.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.1
GPU model and memory: 1080Ti
Exact command to reproduce:  Any command like tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(tf.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='valid', activation=tf.nn.relu)(x)) where x is any tensor that has keras metadata like _keras_shape and/or _keras_history,

Describe the problem
wrapping any tensor which contains keras metadata such as _keras_shape or _keras_histroy with tf.layers.Layer or passing it through tf.layers.Conv2D does not preserve the keras metadata instead it discards them. In addition the tf.layers.Layer does not implement any _add_inbound_node method which is really confusing and leads to many errors with shape mismatches.
