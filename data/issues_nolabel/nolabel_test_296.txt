Better support for composite dataflow variables and time series

Perhaps you can have better support for composite data flow variables. E.g. modelling a moving window multivariate time-series, where you have a series of vectors and as new vectors are added calculations are triggered only for values which need re calculation. Also if a calculation is dependent on a slice updates are propagated in the most optimal way that only the needed data is recalculated.
The composite values can be:

Same type:

Vectors
Matrices
Arrays
Series
Data frames
Slices


Different types:

Tuples (also series with different types)
Tables (also Data Frames with different types)
Views (slices with different types)
