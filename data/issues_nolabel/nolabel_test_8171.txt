add backup URL for downloading MNIST

A lot of folks (#6742, #8126, #8134,
#8116) have been having sporadic trouble downloading MNIST, because the site where it is canonically hosted sometimes goes down. This PR just adds a backup URL for convenience (though with the increased traffic the backup will get when normal MNIST is down, the backup might fail too. Someone might want to put this up on S3 or something Google-hosted.)
