Fix the calculation of the histogram buckets and writing to the tensor in summary_db_writer

Issue: 1141: Incorrect data being written out for the histogram in the db

The data is getting clobbered in MigrateHistogram when writing it to a Tensor. This results in incorrect data being stored in the db

The pr provides a fix for this.
