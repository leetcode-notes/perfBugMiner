Mutability of TF_NewTensor’s arguments

The C API provides the following function for creating tensors:
extern TF_Tensor* TF_NewTensor(TF_DataType, long long* dims, int num_dims,
                               void* data, size_t len,
                               void (*deallocator)(void* data, size_t len,
                                                   void* arg),
                               void* deallocator_arg);
Based on what the function does conceptually and on how it is implemented, it doesn’t seem to be reasonable that dims is required to be a pointer to mutable data. This makes the usage of the function a bit inconvenient, especially when developing bindings for other languages. If it’s OK to change the signature of the function, I can submit a pull request. Thanks!
