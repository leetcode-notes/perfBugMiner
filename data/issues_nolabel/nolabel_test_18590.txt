Distributed Tensorflow:tensorflow prediction

I want to use many arm as tensorflow cluster to prediction.but I can't find some helpful demo or instructions about it.
In tensorflow distributed demo training we can see
Cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"ps": ps_hosts, "worker": worker_hosts})
Cluster from the parameter server and worker hosts, I would like to know that the computing cluster created by the code here is only for training? What should I do if I want to create a cluster for prediction?
