Allow for different input signatures for different modes and additionally updating zlib fix

Reopening #5546 on request of @martinwicke
Changes were reverted back for estimator.py which allows different input signatures under different operating modes (EVAL, INFER, TRAIN).
Additionally, I had to also fix weird zlib error which happened due to the updation of version.
