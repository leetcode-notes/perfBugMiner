Provide tf-nightly in PyPI for up-to-date python versions

Hi, is there any reason that there are no up-to-date tf-nightly - Packages on PyPI?
https://pypi.org/simple/tf-nightly/
The latest tf-nightly version for Python 3.6 is 1.8.0.dev20180331.
Using Python 3.5 I get 1.9.0.dev20180423.
This is annoying for users on Ubuntu 18.04, as there is only python 3.6
