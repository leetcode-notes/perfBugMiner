MKL: Fixed 3 bugs picked up by the unit tests

There were 2 kinds of registrations for MatMul - with and without the 'eigen' label. Re-added the registrations with the 'eigen' label when MKL is used.
Removed the ifdef that removed the check for the label when MKL was used. The eigen op should be called when the eigen label is used.
In the selective registration header test, unicode strings aren't handled correctly, so there's a "u" before the kernel class string that is compared to the hardcoded string. This has been fixed.
