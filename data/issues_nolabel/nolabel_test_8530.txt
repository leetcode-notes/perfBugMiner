import error after installing tensorflow from source

i have build tensorflow from source and got a lot of warning but it was done without errors.But now when I import tensorflow it is giving the error mentioned below:
`p_rakash@prakash008:~$ python3
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.3.1 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:53:06)
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux

import tensorflow as tf
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/prakash/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/init.py", line 61, in 
from tensorflow.python import pywrap_tensorflow
ImportError: cannot import name 'pywrap_tensorflow'



During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "/home/prakash/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/init.py", line 24, in

raise ImportError(msg)
