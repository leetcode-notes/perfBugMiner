Fix build errors on AVX2+ hosts with -march=native.

third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/FixedPoint and third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/Tensor use different paths to reach into unsupported/Eigen/CXX/src/Tensor. The former's paths cause the build errors documented in #6558. This commit removes the includes from third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/FixedPoint pointing into third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX/FixedPoint, because they do not appear to be necessary.
@benoitsteiner @rmlarsen The includes were added in #6323 -- do you happen to remember why they're there?
/cc @drpngx If this PR is accepted, #6723 should be closed.
