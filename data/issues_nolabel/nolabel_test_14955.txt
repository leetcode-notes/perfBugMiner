add support for quantized ops on windows

Quantized ops support on windows. Added some simple python unit test to make sure it works.
Gotcha: I need to use the latest version of gemmlowp in gemmlowp.cmake which is not on mirror.bazel.build so I use github.com directly for now.
This should provide the same functionality as tf on linux. Performance could be better because msvc can't make use of the inline asm in gemmlowp (compiling gemmlowp with clang would show much better results).
