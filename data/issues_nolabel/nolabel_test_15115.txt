Describe the problem
I found the result tf.metrics.accuracy returns is incorrect when I trained my model. To verify this I wrote a  simple program.
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()
labels = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
predictions = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
acc, _ = tf.metrics.accuracy(labels, predictions)
my_acc = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(labels, predictions), tf.float32))

feed_dict = {
    labels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
    predictions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer())

sess.run(acc, feed_dict)  # 0.0
sess.run(my_acc, feed_dict)  # 1.0
You can see that acc and my_acc is different and acc is wrong. I double checked the doc and still confused. Is there anything I missed? Thank you.
