Feature request -forwardsolve and backsolve

I would like to use OLS to estimate parameters in some parts of my models. We're most of the way there today: QR decomposition is already implemented; we just need a backsolve command. And while we're at it, we might as well add a forwardsolve command. For example, one solution would just be calls to SGETRS	CGETRS	DGETRS	ZGETRS in LAPACK and their transpose equivalents.
