Erase Operation on tf.contrib.lookup.MutableHashTable

System information

TensorFlow r1.3

Describe the problem
The tf.contrib.lookup package has MutableHashTable class which wraps the C++11 std::unordered_map class. However, the erase method of unordered_map is not exposed.
Is there some existing way to erase keys from the lookup table?
If not I can create a patch with a new kernel/op on the MutableHashTable classes, and also add a method to the Python API.
Thanks
