"bazel test --config=cuda" can't find "libcurand.so.7.5"

For instance (today's head, Bazel 0.2.3 on Ubuntu)
bazel test -c opt --config=cuda tensorflow/contrib/distributions:chi2_test I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:102] Couldn't open CUDA library libcurand.so.7.5. LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
I'm setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64, but bazel test starts own environment where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is empty. Strangely though, it finds libcublas/libcudnn/libcufft which are in the same directory as libcurand.so.7.5
A work-around it to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and run the test harness through Python stub rather than through blaze test
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
bazel test -c opt --config=cuda tensorflow/contrib/distributions:chi2_test
bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/chi2_test
