//util/python:python_headers: 'python_include' resolves to 'util/python/python_include' not in 'third_party'

I am installing TensorFlow on Unbutu 12.04 with source code. I can build bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu successfully, but where i create pip package, i get the warnning:

I have run ./configure like this:
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]:
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N] n
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GPU support? [y/N] y
GPU support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Please specify which gcc nvcc should use as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]: /usr/bin/gcc-4.9
Please specify the Cuda SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]: 7.0
Please specify the location where CUDA 7.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify the Cudnn version you want to use. [Leave empty to use system default]: 7.0
Please specify the location where cuDNN 7.0 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size.
