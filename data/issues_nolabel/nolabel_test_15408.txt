New rolling window batch operation for tf.data.Dataset #15044

This is a new feature
For help pre-processing datasets, creates a transformation function that can be applied to a tf.data.Dataset Object to create a new Dataset by rolling a window across the initial Dataset to create the batches for the new Dataset.
*Fails if Dataset is too large to fit in memory (possible future work?)
