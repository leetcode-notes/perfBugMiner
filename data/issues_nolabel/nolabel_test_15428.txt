[BUG] Cifar10 mutigpu loss does not decrease and is oscillating

Hi
I want to develope a resnet50 multigpu system in tensorflow,
so I want to replace my model in cifar10_multigpu_train
but when I run this code, loss does not decrease efficiently,until step 5000
my question is : can I trust this code? Is  the code correct?
I use:
ubuntu 16.04
installed tensorflow with pip2
tensorflow 1.4
cudnn       6
cuda     8.0.44
Gtx 1080 (2 gpus/8g memory)
command to produce:
go to the above link,download cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py and run it
