how do `TensorFlowInferenceInterface` process image whose height not equal to width

I'm writing a java service using Spring boot and my tensorflow predict model was trained by python Tensorflo Object Detection API. The model is FasterRCNN (coco-resnet),the model can accept any shape(whose height not equal to width,such as  600x800,1280x720) of image in python while thing cannot be done like this in Java.
I read an example code written in Java from TensorFlowImageClassifier.java,the pre-allocate buffers is  $inputSize * inputSize$. If i changed that to inputHeight*inputWidth and some other nessary code, the inference process still went fine but recognize accuracy decrease dramatically.
Can anybody give some tips?
Here is my coding envirnoment:

Window 10
Tensorflow 1.5 build from whl
CUDA 8.0 with cudnn 5.1
GPU  nvidia 1080 ti
16GB Memory
