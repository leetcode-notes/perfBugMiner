train inception from scratch: imagenet_train not a target

I successfully compiled tensorflow and I was able to run the retrain binary with my own images.
I'd like to retrain inception from scratch, as described here, but the package is not available:
$ bazel build inception/imagenet_train
ERROR: no such target '//:inception/imagenet_train': target 'inception/imagenet_train' not declared in package
