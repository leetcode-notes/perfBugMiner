Use correct variable scope for weights in rnn_cell._linear.

If a scope is passed in it should be used for the variable scope
rather than always falling back to the default scope.
This change in behaviour was a consequence of recent cleanup in
92da8ab. The commit may alter the name of "weights" variable in saved
checkpoints but is necessary if two rnn_cell._linear layers exist in
the same parent variable scope.
