batch_normalization layer argument name and documentation wrong in core and contrib layers

The batch normalization layers both in core and contrib take a center argument that controls whether a variable beta should be created that is then added after the normalization. The name of the argument (center) and even more so the documentation (center: If True, subtract beta. If False, beta is ignored.) indicate however that this argument controls whether the mean of the input is subtracted as part of the normalization.
