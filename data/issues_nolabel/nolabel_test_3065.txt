Problem running build_all_ios.sh

Mac OS X: El Capitan (10.11.4)
I am trying to build Tensorflow for iOS and am following the "Building all at once" instructions found here.  When running the build_all_ios.sh file, I am getting the following errors:

I have been able to overcome many issues up to this one but am now stuck.  Any suggestions?
