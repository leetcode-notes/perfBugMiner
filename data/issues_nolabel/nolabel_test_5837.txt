Streaming Median Metric

I'd like to contribute a streaming median metric to:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/metrics/python/ops/metric_ops.py
Using something like the min/max heap streaming median algorithm:

This method requires some kind of heap/list of tensors. To my knowledge you can't define a tf.Variable to be a list. Can you suggest how to solve this, or a better way to approach this problem? Thanks.
