Update `tf.nn.in_top_k` to use v2 kernel.

This fix is a follow up to PR #11197 so that tf.nn.in_top_k uses V2 kernel now.
This fix follows the API compatibility workflow (3 weeks).
This fix also updates related tests so that gen_nn_ops could be removed.
This fix fixes #9717.
NOTE: In the original PR #11197, the _in_top_kv2 was incorrectly called even the comments specified to wait for 3 weeks. That was fixed by commit 3e3eebd
(Thanks @vrv for the fix).
