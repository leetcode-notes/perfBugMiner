           math_ops.log(predictions + epsilon)) - math_ops.multiply( 
        
    
  


here we are only considering one extreme that the value of prediction can be "zero", missing out probably that it can be "one" also.
If the variables predictions value is 1 then this would return a log loss of
-log(1+1e-7) = -4.3429446044209946e-08
wherein if such occurs multiple times than it can indicate a lower loss.
I suggest clipping the value between [ 0.0000001 , 0.9999999 ]
