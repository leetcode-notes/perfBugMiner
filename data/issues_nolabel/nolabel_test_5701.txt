Quantization tool is gone?

if you run bazel build tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph with the latest code, it report error: can't not find the files.
if you go to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/quantization folder, the files are not here already and there is no tools folder.
