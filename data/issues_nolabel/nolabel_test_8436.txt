Please provide a working android example with Android Studio 2.3

Obsolete gradle version of android example doesn't allow simply importing it as a directory to Android Studio and get the following error:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'android'.

java.lang.NullPointerException (no error message)

Still trying to solve this, but reproduction is so trivial (simply try to import the project directory to latest Android Studio and build), I would expect it to be solved faster by the community...
