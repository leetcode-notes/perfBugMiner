Deploying Custom CNN implementation frameworks (fasterRCNN, maskRCNN etc) using TF-Serving

Running popular forks (fasterRCNN, maskRCNN), one finds they cannot be serialized as a GraphDef because of the usage of py_funcs. (Ref: Official tf documentation)

The error observed is such:
2018-03-07 21:26:02.451945: E tensorflow_serving/util/retrier.cc:38] Loading servable: {name: saved_model version: 1} failed: Not found: Op type not registered 'PyFunc' in binary running on f39ddd6ef2c7. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process
Is there any official fork/implementation for these popular frameworks or is there some documentation which can be used to convert py_funcs to native tensorflow operations?
Also, kindly let me know if any of the new tf betas in the works support/will support it since I am looking to deploy mine.
Thanks
