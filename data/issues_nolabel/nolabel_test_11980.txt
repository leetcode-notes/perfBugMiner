Fix formatting problems in "Adding an Op" doc

I noticed some minor code formatting issues while reading through [https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op]:

At line 181 of the Markdown file, there is some non-working HTML to show/hide a code listing.
At line 766 of the Markdown file, there is a code listing that ends up with a bunch of extra backslashes when rendered to HTML.
At line 1113 of the Markdown file, there is a code listing (a REGISTER_OP macro) that does not display properly in the HTML version of the document.

This PR fixes 1 and 2 above. The third problem appears to be a bug in the script that generates the HTML, and I wasn't able to find that script anywhere in the source tree.
