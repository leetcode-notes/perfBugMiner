i cant get tensorflow to install

i tried following the steps in the tutorial after installing python 3.6 and 3.5 then i went to cmd and typed in pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow and the gpu version i was told that it could not find a version that satisfies the requierments tensorflow (from versions: ) no matching distribution found for tensorflow. (same for the gpu one)
i also tried this: pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl : and i was told that it is not supported for this wheel which is understandable considering i have a nividia gpu and intel cpu but other than that i really dont know what to do if any one is able to give me commands to put in to the cmd terminal that would be great ill list my pc specs here: windows 7 pro, intel Q8300, nividia 560TI, 12GB DDR3 ram. as far as i know i have all the latest drivers installed and such and more than enough room for any files that might need to be downloaded. any help is appreciated.
