Fixes a potential thread leak in the gRPC runtime.

Increases the number of pending CleanupGraph requests that a WorkerService will handle to avoid requests being dropped (or backpressure causing an unbounded number of cleanup closure threads being created at the master).
Avoids creating a thread every time the runtime wants to clean up a step.

Fixes #3470.
