sneaky re-release of TF 1.7.0?

Someone informed us that the checksum of the source tarball from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/v1.7.0.tar.gz changed according to what we had in place (was 2df5e308357356c9ffb7e9a7816dfa9947bd8928f9d406cf7e851b82853931ea, now is c676a96fc8700722816b2b98c85578b2f99fac7a7b2484c9c7f0641484f8d50d).
After some investigation, it seems there was indeed a "re-release" without changing the version number, see easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs#6146 for more details.
Can someone confirm this, and share some more information on why this was done?
This sort of practice should really be avoided at all costs...
I guess @annarev could probably shed some light on this, since the most recent 1.7.0 tag done by @annarev.
