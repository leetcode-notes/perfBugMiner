Checkpoint Restore blocked by changed default bias variable name

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Built from source (016da8c)
Has there been a recent change that modified the default name of the bias variable from "bias" to "biases" (in the nn_ops.conv2d)?
When loading from a checkpoint there is an error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: Tensor name "model/attention_decoder/Attention_0/fully_connected/biases" not found in checkpoint files .../model.ckpt
Looking the variables stored in a checkpoint file the closest match is:
model/attention_decoder/Attention_0/fully_connected/bias (DT_FLOAT) [512]
Loading this checkpoint file had been working fine for weeks, so it seems like a TF update that has caused the issue.
Can the model.ckpt[.meta] be edited to work around the change?  If so, is there a guide or any pointers for how to do it.
