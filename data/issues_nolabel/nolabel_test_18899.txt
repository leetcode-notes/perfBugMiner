Describe the problem
As mentioned in this issue, #include <libjpg.h> has to be after #include <stdio.h> or else it won't have definitions for FILE, size_t, etc.
In the current version of label_image.cc the order of the includes is wrong ad thus the build fails.
Swapping the two includes fixes the problem (I'll provide a PR as soon as I have time, if someone else doesn't beat me to it first)
