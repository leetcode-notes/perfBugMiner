convert a tensor to matrix

Hi,
output of first layer cnn , "if  input was a image with size[100,150] then the output layer is a tensor (1,100,150,32)"
for slicing The first image from all 32 output images, i used this code:
conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d( image, filters=32, kernel_size=[5, 5], padding="same", activation=tf.nn.relu)
first_image=slice(conv1,[0,0,0,0],[1, 100, 152, 1])


conv1 is  tensor (1, 100, 150 ,32)
first_image is tensor (1, 100 ,150 , 1)


has the Tensorflow  a command for convert a tensor to 2-D matrix directly ?, or how can convert a tensor to matrix in Tensorflow?
