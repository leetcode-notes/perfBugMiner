Tensor Flow Installation issue: couldnot find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow

I am trying to install Tensorflow through anaconda. Following is the error when I try to install
"couldnot find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow".
I tried to create two sessions - with Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 - but both of them returns the error identically.
Code used in the activated sessions: pip install tensorflow
Screenshot1 - Python 3.6 (Environment name: tenflow)

Screenshot2 - Python 3.6 (Environment name: tflow)
