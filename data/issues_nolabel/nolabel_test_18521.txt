Update gemmlowp version for cmake build

The gemmlowp has been updated in bazel, though
cmake version was not updated. This fix updates
gemmlowp in cmake so that cmake and bazel versions
are synced.
The fix has been tested on Linux:
tensorflow/tools/ci_build/ci_build.sh CMAKE tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/cmake.sh
