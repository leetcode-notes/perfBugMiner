CNN features feed to LSTM Tensorflow

Hello Guys
So recently i am working on a project which i am supposed to take images as input to a CNN and extract the features and feed them to LSTM for training. I am using 2 Layer CNN for feature extraction and im taking the features form fully connected layer and trying to feed them to LSTM. Problem is when i want to feed the FC layer to LSTM as input i get error regarding to wrong dimension. my FC layer is a Tensor with (128,1024) dimension. I tried to reshape it like this tf.reshape(fc,[-1]) which gives me a tensor ok (131072, )
dimension and still wont work. Could anyone give me any ideas of how im suppose to feed the FC to LSTM?here i just write part of my code and teh error i get.
Convolution Layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of 5
    conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(x, 32, 5, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    # Max Pooling (down-sampling) with strides of 2 and kernel size of 2
    conv1 = tf.layers.max_pooling2d(conv1, 2, 2)

    # Convolution Layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of 5
    conv2 = tf.layers.conv2d(conv1, 64, 3, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    # Max Pooling (down-sampling) with strides of 2 and kernel size of 2
    conv2 = tf.layers.max_pooling2d(conv2, 2, 2)

    # Flatten the data to a 1-D vector for the fully connected layer
    fc1 = tf.contrib.layers.flatten(conv2)

    # Fully connected layer (in contrib folder for now)
    fc1 = tf.layers.dense(fc1, 1024)
    # Apply Dropout (if is_training is False, dropout is not applied)
    fc1 = tf.layers.dropout(fc1, rate=dropout, training=is_training)
    s = tf.reshape(fc1, [1])
rnn_cell = rnn.BasicLSTMCell(n_hidden, forget_bias=1.0)
outputs, states = rnn.static_rnn(rnn_cell, s, dtype=tf.float32)
return tf.matmul(outputs[-1], rnn_weights['out']) + rnn_biases['out']
here is the error:

ValueError: Cannot reshape a tensor with 131072 elements to shape [1] (1 elements) for 'ConvNet/Reshape' (op: 'Reshape') with input shapes: [128,1024], [1] and with input tensors computed as partial shapes: input[1] = [1].
