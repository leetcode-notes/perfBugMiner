Feature request:  do not reload latest checkpoint on each DNNRegressor.predict() call

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Each DNNRegressor.predict (or predict_scores) call reloads model parameters from the latest saved model checkpoint, even if the checkpoint hasn't changed between predict() calls.  This slows down generation of predictions.  It will be helpful to be able to disable reloading of model parameters after the initial loading, and/or to be able to reload the latest checkpoint manually via a separate function call.
