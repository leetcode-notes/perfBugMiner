Describe the problem
It seems there is no gradient defined for the Select operation in the C++ API.
I am actually getting this issue while using the C++ API through the C# bindings provided by the TensorFlowSharp project, and for this reason I didn't fill the "exact command to reproduce" field above. However, seeing that @ops.RegisterGradient("Select") is placed in math.grad.py, and given that there is no analogous REGISTER_GRADIENT_OP("Select", SelectGrad) instruction in math_grad.cc, tells me that the gradient for the Select op is indeed still missing from the C++ API.
Hope its not a false alarm given that I didn't test libtensorflow.dll directly.
