Improve TensorFlow Lite description

I just started working with the new TensorFlow Lite interface and noticed a few errors in the description.

First of all, there is a small typo / copy and paste error that is already fixed in this pr.
Furthermore, the new file extension isn't described consistently. Sometimes it's .lite and sometimes it's .tflite. This inconsistency may be improved at other places as well.
Finally, the given link that shall describe the Android integration isn't up-to-date. Instead of the new compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:+' resource, the old one (compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:+') is given.
