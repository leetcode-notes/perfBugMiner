Cannot run the android example on Android 5.1.1

The android example APK can be successfully compiled and installed (except that adb -g option is not recognized), however, at launch it shows "Failed" without showing any camera view.
Device is a Nexus 6 with Android 5.1.1.
This is what I have in WORKSPACE
# Uncomment and update the paths in these entries to build the Android demo.
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    api_level = 22, 
    build_tools_version = "22.0.1",
    # Replace with path to Android SDK on your system
    path = "/home/victor/Android/Sdk/",
)
#
android_ndk_repository(
    name="androidndk",
    path="/home/victor/Downloads/android-ndk-r10e",
    api_level=21)
