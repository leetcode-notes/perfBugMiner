unchanging minibatches from skflow DataFeeder for unsupervised tasks

I'm pretty sure there's a bug here in the DataFeeder class for skflow (tf.contrib.learn).  If there are no labels, then the mapping of input placeholders to inputs is returned without updating the minibatch offsets.  The code for updating offsets and shuffling won't be reached.
