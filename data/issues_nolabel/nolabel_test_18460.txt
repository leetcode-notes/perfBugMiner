tf.nn.conv3d_transpose operation with data_format='NCDHW'

System information
Irrelevant.
Describe the problem
In implementation of "tf.nn.conv3d_transpose" operation with "data_format='NCDHW'",
the shape compatibility of "output shape" and "kernel size" check is not carried out correctly. (However, the check is fine in tf.nn.conv2d_transpose)
Source code / logs
if isinstance(output_shape, (list, np.ndarray)): # output_shape's shape should be == [5] if reached this point. if not filter.get_shape()[3].is_compatible_with(output_shape[4]): raise ValueError( "output_shape does not match filter's output channels, " "{} != {}".format(output_shape[4], filter.get_shape()[3]))
should be changed to
if isinstance(output_shape, (list, np.ndarray)): # output_shape's shape should be == [5] if reached this point. if not filter.get_shape()[3].is_compatible_with(output_shape[axis]): raise ValueError( "output_shape does not match filter's output channels, " "{} != {}".format(output_shape[axis], filter.get_shape()[3]))
more specifically, output_shape[4] to output_shape[axis].
