Improve transform_graph tool dependencies

System information

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source

Is there any way we can improve this dependency chain? The transform graph tool really shoudn't need to know about kernel implementations as far as I can tell.  Perhaps the appropriate place to cut this is at @org_tensorflow//tensorflow/core:tensorflow_opensource. Maintainer thoughts?
