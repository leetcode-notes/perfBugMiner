Initialize moving averages by the first applied value rather than 0

Currently hidden moving averages are initialized by 0. If the decay is large, it takes a lot of time for the moving average variable to forget about initial zero value. It would be much more reasonable to initialize by the first obtained value of the observed variable, and then start to apply decay. In this case the initial initialization is not required anymore, so the variable can be removed from the "assert_variables_initialized" list
