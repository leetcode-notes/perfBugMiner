anaconda environment: install of protobuf library does not work

Hello,
I tried to install the special package of protobuf as proposed in here. I get errors
Environment info
Operating System: MAC OSX Yosemite 10.10.5 (14F1713)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

I use anaconda environment
created environment like "conda create -n tf python=2.7"
activated environment with "source activate tf"
installed easy_setup with "sudo -H curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python"
installed tensorflow with "sudo -H pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-any.whl"
tested if I can import tensorflow from python. OK, no problem
installed protobuf by "pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/protobuf-3.0.0b2.post2-cp27-none-any.whl"
tested again if I can import tensorflow in python. NOK

terminal showed

Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.
Repeated above flow twice in newly created envs to see if problem repeatable, yes ;-(
thanks for the help
