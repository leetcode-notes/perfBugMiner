Could TensorFlow support tf.nn.separable_conv1d in future release?

Dear TensorFlower:
Currently TensorFlow only has tf.nn.separable_conv2d support and it is convenient to use.
Could it is possible in future release tf.nn.separable_conv1d be added? Since I am intensively using TensorFlow for processing bio-signals, so it is more attractive for TensorFlow having such support at this regard.
Best regards
