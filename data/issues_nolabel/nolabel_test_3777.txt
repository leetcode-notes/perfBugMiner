Problems in TensorFlow Linear Model Tutorial

I believe the TensorFlow Linear Model tutorial incorrectly points to wide_n_deep_tutorial.py code. For example that code does not put in place the L1 and L2 regularization that is mentioned (and for which the code is shown) in the tutorial text.
I assume the tutorial was written up based on a different python script?
Also, wide_n_deep_tutorial.py will not work on Python 3 as it calls urllib.urlretrieve directly. Perhaps it should use the maybe_download function from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.base?
