cmake build doesn't work for debug build

On Windows, cmake build work fine for release build.
But for debug build, some projects are still using Release settings, for example:
protobuf\src\protobuf\Release\protoc.exe is used, should be protobuf\src\protobuf\Debug\protoc.exe
zlib.lib is used, should be zlibd.lib
