Eager: Random seeds

(This applies only when eager execution has been enabled via tfe.enable_eager_execution())
Setting the graph-level random seed exactly once, before any operations are executed, works as intended; however, subsequent invocations to tf.set_random_seed() will not reset operation randomness. Furthermore, keyword arguments that set operation-level seeds have no effect when executing in eager mode. Random sequences generated by the same graph-seed will vary depending upon whether you are constructing a graph or executing eagerly.
