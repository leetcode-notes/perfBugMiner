tf.summary.scalar error.  despairing......

Strange error
While i was trying to tf.summary.scalar('content_loss', self.content_loss) there came an error
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device for operation 'auto_loss': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
Seems strange. However the code can be trained on GPU without the tf.summary.scalar operation
