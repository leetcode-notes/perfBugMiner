Function for flexible access to the content of a saver / checkpoint file

As far as I am aware, the only ways to interact with a saver file through API are (from https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/variables/index.html , I also looked at the API documentation online):

to restore a full model into exactly the same computational graph
to restore variables 'one at a time' through an op.
Am I right or did I miss something?

Would it be possible to release additional API functions giving more flexible access to a saver file? Like making it possible to:

list all tensors saved and their size, name etc contained in a saver file
access a tensor saved in a saver file by just reading its content and outputting it as a series of numpy arrays (for easy post processing), instead of needing to add an op, run it etc.
