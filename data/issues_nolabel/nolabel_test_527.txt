GLIBC error for RHEL, Centos clusters

After I tried all possible way to get Tensorflow work on my cluster, I re-open the issue according to this: #110
First, bazel require GLIBC 2.14, 3 issues came up, however, no solution or idea for the problem is proposed.
bazelbuild/bazel#583
bazelbuild/bazel#590
bazelbuild/bazel#585
And some issues reported on Tensorflow:
#462
#53
#177
I want to emphasize that the issue is more hopeless for clusters' users, a large amount of services with old Centos remains, and it is impossible to update GLIBC on server.
I asked admin for others way around, and this is his response:

I have made some progress in installing Tensorflow, but it turned out that the version of glibc installed on Cluster is not new enough.
The version 0.1.1 of bazel checks the version of glibc during installation process and exits with an error that glibc 2.14 is not available.
The version 0.1.0 of bazel builds successfully, but later it turns out that Tensorflow requires even newer version glibc: 2.16.
Moreover, Glibc is very difficult, practically impossible, to install to a non-standard location, so I'm afraid that we cannot help with that either.

I can confirm that we should never try to build our own GLIBC, you cannot even type 'ls' or 'cd' on server. Hence, the only hope is from tensorflow team support.
Best Regards.
