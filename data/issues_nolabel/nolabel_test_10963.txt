tf.TensorArray.stack(name="aname") bug

System information

Code + Interpreter: Notice the print out is "stackme/stackme:0" instead of "stackme:0".
This is a really minor error. But I had spent at least half an hour wondering why my operation was called twice. Would be really nice to be fixed :)

imemory = tf.TensorArray(tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True, name="memory")
imemory.write(0, tf.constant(0))
imemory = imemory.write(0, tf.constant(0))
imemory = imemory.write(1, tf.constant(1))
imemory = imemory.write(2, tf.constant(2))
result = imemory.stack(name="stackme")
print(result)

<print out>Tensor("stackme/stackme:0", shape=(?,), dtype=float32)
