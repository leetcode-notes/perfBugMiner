Check failed: NDIMS == dims() (2 vs. 1)

I get the following error after building the graph of my NN. when I try to execute :
loss, _ = self._sess.run([self.loss_op, self.train_op], feed_dict=feed_dict)
I get this error :
F tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:36] Check failed: NDIMS == dims() (2 vs. 1) Asking for tensor of 2 dimensions from a tensor of 1 dimensions
I don't succeed to know to which part of the graph this error is related to ... Because, normaly the graph is build, so shapes should be correct ... are not ?
I am using Tensorflow version 1.0.0 with python API.
It could be a bug according to the first reply here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43413293/tensorflow-check-failed-ndims-dims-2-vs-1
