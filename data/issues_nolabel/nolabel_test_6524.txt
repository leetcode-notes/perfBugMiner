Feature request: Support reference counting on Java Tensor class

The Tensor class of the new Java library would be more useful and easier to use with built-in reference counting, based on a common interface RefCounted.    This would be in lieu of AutoCloseable.
I suggest that reference counting follow the Netty approach as described in the docs.   A nice aspect is that it simplifies the common case of supplying an input tensor to Session.Runner::feed() or to OperationBuilder::setAttr (the caller needn't unref the tensor; the callee will unref it).  At the same time, a reference count is of more general utility than AutoCloseable.
Please consider applying the idea to Session and Graph later.
