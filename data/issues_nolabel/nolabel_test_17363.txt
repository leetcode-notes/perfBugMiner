zeros() not tracking shape based on input tensors

>>> shape = [constant([2])[0], 3]
>>> reshape([1,2,3,4,5,6], shape)
<tf.Tensor 'Reshape_13:0' shape=(2, 3) dtype=int32>
>>> zeros(shape)
<tf.Tensor 'zeros_2:0' shape=(?, 3) dtype=float32>

If reshape can understand the input values well enough to set a static shape for its output, shouldn't zeros() be able to?
This is using tensorflow 1.5
