I see some problem regarding Reproducibility of result. Here I have given a notebook. Each of the cell  contains same code with same seed of tensorflow except that in the middle cell contains only single placeholder extra that has nothing to do with the graph input. But I don't know why random number generation is different for just declaring a single placeholder extra. Is that an expected behavior?
