Pass dtype to constructor in LSTMCell

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #16228 where the dtype is not passed to LSTMCell and causes a TypeError when build() is called.
This fix pass the dtype to constructor in LSTMCell so that the initializer in build could be invoked. In case None is passed for dtype, float32 is used for initializer.
This fix fixes #16228.
