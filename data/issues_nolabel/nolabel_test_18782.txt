Error in installation Tensorflow , windows

Hi, I have installed Cuda and CudaDLl files and also defined paths to the respective folders. I am still getting an error on launching Tesorflow module saying DLL failed. I checked the folders. I think I have all the files in the respective folders. I think I am missing something below is the error screen on importing tensor flow.
