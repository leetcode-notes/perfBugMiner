a Makefile would be supremely helpful

It'd be really useful to have a Makefile to build the tree.  Bazel (or it is blaze?) isn't working for us out of the gate, and it's rather non-obvious what it will try to do given its config files.
If someone could provide a transcript of a full build (preferably with GPU), showing external commands run and simulated (e.g., if bazel does 'cp' itself, for example), I'll try to work on this.
For the record, here's the initial fail I see when trying to build, without GPU to keep things simple.  No doubt I'm making some novice error.  Nonetheless, this diagnostic is rather opaque compared to what one might expect from 'make'.  (Maybe something is missing?  The tree was grabbed with 'git clone --recurse-submodules' though.)
$ bazel build --logging=6 -c opt //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
