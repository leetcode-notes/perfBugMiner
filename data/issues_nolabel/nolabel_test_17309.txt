Scaffolding for int8 calibration in TF-TRT

This PR prepares scaffolding for Int8 calibration pass for creating int8 TRTEngineOps.
It introduces

TRTCalibOp which is used for collecting calibration information
TRTInt8Calibratior implementing TRT calibration interface and forwards TF data to TRT engine
TRTResourceManager and various simple resource constructs to keep data throughout op and session executions as well as steer TRT Calibration.
Some of these will be updated in subsequent PRs when calibration infrastructure matures.
This PR is intentionally kept minimal to reduce changes in upcoming PRs.
