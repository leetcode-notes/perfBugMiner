Add a simple BMP decoder and enable it on Android

Add a simple BMP decoder and enable it on Android so that we can test simple image classification in command line on Android platform. On Android, image decoding is not directly available to NDK C/C++
programs.
Why bmp?
.bmp can be decoded easily without relying on external libraries.
