Describe the problem
Following the move to Java API in commit 1a9769d, it seems that it is very ineffective to feed nodes.
I am feeding my model an input array of about 1100 floats, and when I sample CPU usage using CPU Profiler on Android Studio (Instrumented) it seems that the feed method takes ~x4 time than running the inference. If I leave everything the same but I use android libs compiled in tensorflow 1.0.1 CPU time of feed method (used to be fillNodeFloat) becomes negligible.
It seems that putting a float array into the Tensor's FloatBuffer is a very costly operation.

TF 1.4.0:
Relevant inference code:
tensorflow.feed(INPUT_NODE_NAME, input, shape);
tensorflow.run(OUTPUT_NAMES);
tensorflow.fetch(OUTPUT_NAMES[0], output);
