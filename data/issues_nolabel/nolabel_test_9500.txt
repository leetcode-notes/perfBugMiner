Tensorflow Video Decoding on a Separate Thread in a Distributed System

Having a distributed system, I need to enqueue frames on a CPU device, while processing the frames, that is, training the network, has to be on a GPU device. Could this be performed in parallel?
Currently, tensorflow enables Audio coding through FFMPEG(contrib), are there any features for video encoding and decoding which is multi-threaded?
