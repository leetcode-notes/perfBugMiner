Hi, I am trying to use the inception model to learn to classify between about 200 different object types.  I tried the approach mentioned here, which seems to only retrain the last few layer of the model, and I can't get about ~ 60% accuracy even when I am training the model. I imagine if I pass on the gradient and change the weights in the lower layers, that I will be able to improve the accuracy of the model when applied to my data set.
How do I go about doing this ? Any guidance on this being done else where would be extremely helpful.
