layers.py spatial_softmax activation can be selected by user

Allow user specified activation functions to be selected when calling spatial_softmax.
I wanted to keep the changes minimal, but it may be worth considering a rename of the layer to spatial_activation with softmax as the default. spatial_softmax could simply call spatial_activation or be removed. Thoughts?
