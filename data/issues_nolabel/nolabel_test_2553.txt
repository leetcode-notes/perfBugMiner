Add support for circle_ci or travis upon pull request.

It would be good to have an automatic and simple first continuous integration rule that will run when a pull request is submitted/updated. We could leverage some of the free services out there to handle this task. I presume both the compilation and the testing will be quite slow but it will provide a first line of filtering. The commands would be the same as in the ci_build so no active maintenance should be required.
