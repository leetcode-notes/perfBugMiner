Calculate a vector l1 norm of a tensor creates unnecessary copy of tensor

I am using tensorflow 0.9.
when I am trying to calculate a simple l1-norm of vector, like
    matrix = vs.get_variable("Matrix", [total_arg_size, output_size])                      
    l1norm = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(matrix))                                                 
Tensorflow allocates memory for the results of tf.abs(matrix). when matrix size are large, this could cause out of memory issue.
Is there a way I can avoid this additional allocation?
