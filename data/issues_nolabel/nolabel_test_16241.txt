Fix a buildscript error which prevents macro being used by other workspaces

Converting to label and back to string will prepend current workspace,
e.g: //tensorflow -> @org_tensorflow//tensorflow. Projects who
integrate TensorFlow from another Bazel workspace, and use macros like
tflite_copts() need the prefix.
For more info please take a look at: bazelbuild/bazel#1551
