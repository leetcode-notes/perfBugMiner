MKL: Removing visited_node hash table - fixing multinode shape mismatch issue

This PR fixes an issue that arises in multinode setup. MklLayoutRewritePass
maintains a hash table for visited nodes, and the hash table is part of the
pass and used for every graph being rewritten. But it looks like in multinode
setup, multiple graphs may be processed simulteneously leading to incorrect
modifications to the hash table. So removing the hash table as we do not
really need it.
