Gradient of reduce_prod does not support negative axis

The gradient of reduce_prod does not support negative axis unlike reduce_prod itself.
It is apparently caused by gather not supporting negative axes.
This code illustrates the problem.
import tensorflow as tf

vars = tf.Variable([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
prod = tf.reduce_prod(vars, -1) # Negative axis here

tf.InteractiveSession()
tf.global_variables_initializer().run()
print(prod.eval()) # Works fine
print(tf.gradients(prod, vars)[0].eval()) # Crashes
