fixed tf.pow edge case

The tf.pow() function has an edge case which causes it to hang with no error message.
If you try to evaluate tf.pow(x,y), when x is an integer (and thus the output tensor is also an integer), while y is a negative value, tensorflow hangs trying to cast the fraction as an integer.
