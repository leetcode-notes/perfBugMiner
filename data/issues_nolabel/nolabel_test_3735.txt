Giving `name` attributes to `Graph` and `Session`

I wanted to gauge thoughts on adding a string name attribute to Graph and Session objects. Currently, there's no programmatic way to identify specific Graphs or Sessions from a generic handle.
There's no mechanism to ensure unique graph/session names (unless I'm mistaken), but it should still be beneficial even without guaranteeing unique names. In a larger system that may be tossing around multiple sessions and graphs, it would be good to have a way to know what graph is being handled (or what family of graphs, if multiple graphs have the same name). The uses for this could also be extended out to TensorBoard, exporting graphs/models, etc.
Perhaps it would be better off being called tag, but I went with name to keep it consistent with current code.
Good idea, terrible idea, somewhere in the middle?
