ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (1, 40, 3) for Tensor u'cls1_fc_pose_xyz_target:0', which has shape '(?, ?)

I have installed keras using conda with tensorflow backend. I am experimenting with the keras version of posenet architecture. I have introduced a few LSTM layers into the original architecture and now my input should be of 5 dim(n_batch,n_frame,row,col,channel) and my model compiles correctly but when I call the fit function, it throws following error:
Train on 129 samples, validate on 129 samples

Epoch 1/800

Traceback (most recent call last):

`
and here the piece of code that I am using in training:
X_train=np.squeeze(np.array(dataset_train.images,dtype=float))

X_test=np.squeeze(np.array(dataset_test.images,dtype=float))

y_train=np.squeeze(np.array(dataset_train.poses,dtype=float))

print("X_train shape:"+str(X_train.shape))#X_train shape:(129, 40, 224, 224, 3)

print("y_train shape:"+str(y_train.shape))#y_train shape:(129, 40, 7)

y_train_x = y_train[:,:,0:3]

y_train_q = y_train[:,:,3:7]

y_test = np.squeeze(np.array(dataset_test.poses))

print("X_test shape:"+str(X_test.shape))#X_test shape:(129, 40, 224, 224, 3)

print("y_test shape:"+str(y_test.shape))#y_test shape:(129, 40, 7)

y_test_x = y_test[:,:,0:3]

y_test_q = y_test[:,:,3:7]

#Setup checkpointing
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="checkpoint_weights.h5", verbose=1, save_best_only=True, save_weights_only=True)

model.fit(X_train, [y_train_x, y_train_q, y_train_x, y_train_q, y_train_x, y_train_q],
  batch_size=batch_size,
  nb_epoch=800,
  verbose=1,
  validation_data=(X_test, [y_test_x, y_test_q, y_test_x, y_test_q, y_test_x, y_test_q]),
  callbacks=[checkpointer])

and here is the input of my model:
input = Input(shape=(helper.frames_per_sequence,224, 224, 3))

and here is the lines causing error:
cls1_fc1_flat = Flatten()(cls1_reduction_pose)

cls1_fc1_pose = Dense(1024,activation='relu',name='cls1_fc1_pose')(cls1_fc1_flat)

cls1_fc_pose_xyz = Dense(3,name='cls1_fc_pose_xyz')(cls1_fc1_pose)

cls1_fc_pose_wpqr = Dense(4,name='cls1_fc_pose_wpqr')(cls1_fc1_pose)
