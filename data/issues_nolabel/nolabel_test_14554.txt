Exporting tensorflow package for cmake

This PR is based on the PR #13867.
It provides the usage of cmake find_package(). Therefore it should be easier to intergrate the prebuilt tensorflow code into existing external projects.

What about a version control mechanism? (Cons: Has to be manually changed in every new version)
Supplying some examples with the installed version (This examples should not be prebuilt, furthermore they should be built with an installed tensorflow)
