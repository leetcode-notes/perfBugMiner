Adding support for Big Endian in graph_constructor_test and wav_io

PR to add support for Big Endian for resolving below failures:

//tensorflow/core:graph_graph_constructor_test
//tensorflow/core/kernels:decode_wav_op_test
//tensorflow/core:lib_wav_wav_io_test
//tensorflow/core/kernels:encode_wav_op_test

The tensor_content in graph_constructor_test needs to be corrected for big endian.
Also the ReadValue in wav_io.cc needs to be shifted other way for big endian.
