Error in installation guide for windows -- should use cuDNN v6.0 with tensorflow v1.3.0

In the installation guide for windows https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows, where it says 'Requirements to run TensorFlow with GPU support' and 'cuDNN v5.1'.
Actually using cnDNN v5.1 will not work. Instead cnDNN v6.0 works.
This error would cause great waste of time for newbees. Please update the doc. Thanks.
