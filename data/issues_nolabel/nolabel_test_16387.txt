Tensorflow not using GPU

I use windows in my laptop. Initially tensorflow worked well with GPU. I don't know why suddenly it's not detecting the GPU. I am using tensorflow-gpu 1.4 version (installed with pip install tensorflow-gpu) with CUDA 8.0 and cudnn 6.0. I also tried with other versions but the problem persists. Attached is the error message shown. I appreciate any help :)
