Removing twice times declared same statement in Java_org_tensorflow_Operation_shape function

There is an already defined statement in shape method Java_org_tensorflow_Operation_shape:
if (!throwExceptionIfNotOK(env, status)) {
    TF_DeleteStatus(status);
    return nullptr;
  }

However, I found that after TF_GraphGetTensorShape(graph, output, cdims.get(), static_cast<int>(num_dims), status); the same statement was declared or we can probably add throwExceptionIfNotOK(env, status); instead of that statement if it is necessarily required.
