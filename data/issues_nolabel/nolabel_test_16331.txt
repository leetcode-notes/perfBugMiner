Compilation failure with gcc-6.4 (gcc-7.2 and clang-4) in ubuntu 17.10

When compiling master in ubuntu 17.10, compilation fails due to 'too perfect forwarding' in variant_op_registry
std::unordered_map<std::tuple<VariantXOp, StringPiece, StringPiece>, VariantXOpFn, TupleHash>
A workaround, by replacing tuple with a struct, provided in PR #16309 for your review.
Thanks,
