Our shell wrapper around swig is a bug according to bazel

Bazel likes to strip things it doesn't like out of PATH, as discussed at bazelbuild/bazel#957.  For TensorFlow, this is a problem since we have a shell wrapper around swig that just says swig "$@".  In my case, swig is in ~/homebrew/bin.
Since Bazel considers this a bug in TensorFlow rather than in Bazel, it may be more useful to have the discussion here than on the Bazel site.
