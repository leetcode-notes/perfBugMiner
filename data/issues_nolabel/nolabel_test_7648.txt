GPU: no known devices, despite cuda's deviceQuery returning a "PASS" result

Hi guys,
Sorry, I know there's already been tons of GPU related issues, but I could not find any that seems to be related to my problem.
The main symptom: when running tensorflow, my gpu is not detected (the code being run, and its output).
What differs from usual issues is that cuda seems properly installed and running ./deviceQuery from cuda samples is successful (output).
I have two graphical cards:

an old GTX 650 used for my monitors (I don't want to use that one with tensorflow)
a GTX 1060 that I want to dedicate to tensorflow

I use:

tensorflow-1.0.0
cuda-8.0 (ls -l /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcud*)
cudnn-5.1.10
python-2.7.12
nvidia-drivers-375.26 (this was installed by cuda and replaced my distro driver package)

I've tried:

adding /usr/local/cuda/bin/ to $PATH
forcing gpu placement in tensorflow script using with tf.device('/gpu:1'): (and with tf.device('/gpu:0'): when it failed, for good measure)
whitelisting the gpu I wanted to use with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, in case the presence of my old unsupported card did cause problems
running the script with sudo (because why not)

Here are the outputs of nvidia-smi and nvidia-debugdump -l, in case it's useful.
At this point, I feel like I have followed all the breadcrumbs and have no idea what I could try else. I'm not even sure if I'm contemplating a bug or a configuration problem. Any advice about how to debug this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
