Add sess.close() in document (g3doc/get_started/index.md)

I read from tensorflow Session management document that
A session may own resources, such as variables, queues, and readers. It is important to release these resources when they are no longer required.
To do this, either invoke the close() method on the session, or use the session as a context manager. The following two examples are equivalent:
but I found g3doc/get_started/index.md didn't
so I made the pull request for add sess.close() at the end of code.
Thank you for making tensorflow
