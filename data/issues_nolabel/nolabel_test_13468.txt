Issues in training the model on macOS Sierra

hello,
i want to create a AI-chatbot using the tensorflow seq2seq model. So, when i try to train the model there are two issues that i want to ask about:
1- why i'm getting this WARNING
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/emansaad/Desktop/AI-chtabot/Victor/eng-victor/seq2seq_model.py:129 in __init__.: all_variables (from tensorflow.python.ops.variables) is deprecated and will be removed after 2017-03-02.
2-the temperature of my MAC book pro (macOS Sierra) is getting very high and the fans are running to cool the device , is that normal?
