Check failed: message->ParseFromZeroCopyStream(&adaptor)

I replaced the pb&labels.txt files in asset in android demo with what I retrained in examples/image_retraining . I built the demo successfully,but when running ,it shut down,and toast the error message:
Check failed: message->ParseFromZeroCopyStream(&adaptor)
Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 in tid 14617 (ImageListener)
I have no idea about this,please give some advice.
