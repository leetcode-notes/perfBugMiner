Missing variable on MNIST tutorial

I'm writing this here because I can't find a better way to contact someone about this.
In short, first Tensorflow tutorial about MNIST:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/v0.6.0/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html#the-mnist-data
First piece of code:
import tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist.input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True) 

where it should be:
import tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist.input_data as input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True) 

"as input_data" is missing, so when running the second line of code, python doesn't know whats input_data.whatever.
Hope someone can edit that, because it's a begginer tutorial, and can be very frustrating to fail running the very first piece of code of the first and most basic tutorial.
