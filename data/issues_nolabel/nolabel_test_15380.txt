CMake: external package: PIC option not working

In many of external cmake files (/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/external/*.cmake), it tries to turn PIC on and off with:
      CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS
                if(tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE)
                        -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=ON
                else()
                        -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=OFF
                endif()

However, the result (with cmake 3.5) is not what we wanted in CMakeCache:
CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=OFF; endif();

Where it should be
CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=ON

because tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE is ON.
This can be corrected by:
  -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=${tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE}

I'll send a PR after some testing along with other fixes (e.g., linking to ZLIB as shared object, not static linking)
