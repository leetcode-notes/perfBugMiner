Is there a quick tutorial for Windows users to use Tensorflow?

The good news is Tensorflow finally supports Windows platform, but with very trival configurations.
And there is another important: Most of the PCs are running Windows.
So I really think it is truly necessary to provide a easy way for Windows users to run Tensorflow. A good toolkit is always the one that can cross all the platforms, right?
Is there a quick way to connect? On Linux/Mac, we can use pip, just a simple loc, and that's all. Everything seems not so fluid on Windows, why? Is it really that hard? I do think Tensorflow will get far more way if Windows is supported.
