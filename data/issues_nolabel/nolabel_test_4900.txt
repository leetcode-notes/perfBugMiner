Fix a the bug in the doc of a tutorial for training linear model

In this tutorial, the column gender should have two category: "Female/Male" not "female/male". See the source of datasets https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/.
Although the linear model in the tutorial works well, for some other methods like SVM, the existence of column gender in feature_columns will probably terminate the program.
