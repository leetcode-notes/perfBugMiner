How to run the program coding by python in the Android phone?

I already wrote a pretrain vgg16 on my computer(python, Linux), now I want to run this program using my android phone`s CPU/GPU, the outcome could show in terminal. However, I cannot find any hint in this situation, so I want some hint and hope you can update the Readme.
