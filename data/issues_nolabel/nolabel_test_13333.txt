TensorFlow buillt with -march option gives illegal instruction when imported

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.1
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: No GPU
GPU model and memory: No GPU
Exact command to reproduce: Build and Install TensorFlow wheel and import TensorFlow

Describe the problem
I am trying to build TensorFlow by explicitly providing –march option on z13.
In the past I could build and install same version (v1.2.1) with default options(-march=native).
The issue is when I use below commands for configure and build respectively:

Configure -  Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: -march=z13
Build - bazel build -c opt --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package,

the build succeeds however the TensorFlow wheel when installed gives issue of python crash:
root@8a268ac0eaea:~# python
 >>> import tensorflow as tf
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

I have verified the system arch to be z13. However when I use command gcc –Q –help=target I could see -march= zEC12.
I am now trying to debug why passing ‘z13’  causes above issue with wheel.
Also is there a way to find out what arch is exactly detected when ‘native’ is passed?
