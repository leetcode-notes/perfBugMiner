While compiling external app -> fatal error: unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor: No such file or directory

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): It's a C++ code from this tutorial
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): Release 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: no CUDA
GPU model and memory: no GPU
Exact command to reproduce: g++ -I /opt/tensorflow -I /opt/tensorflow/bazel-genfiles loader.cpp

Describe the problem
I have a problem while trying to use tensorflow in external app. I took the code from the tutorial above, built tensorflow with following command: bazel build //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so. Now, I want to build my external application with tensorflow. While compiling with given command, I receive an error. I also tried compiling with cmake and proper include_directories directive, but to no avail.
Source code / logs
The problematic line of code is:
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
Compiling with command: g++ -I /opt/tensorflow -I /opt/tensorflow/bazel-genfiles loader.cpp generates error:
In file included from /opt/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h:19:0,
                 from /opt/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/public/session.h:24,
                 from loader.cpp:1:
/opt/tensorflow/third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor:1:42: fatal error: unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Whole code snippet can be seen in the tutorial link above
Remarks
A similar issue is #4680 but:

It is closed without specific information, if it's resolved or not.
There is a comment, which states, that if similar issue happens in future, it should be opened as new issue
The use case there was not precisely using external app on Ubuntu, but on RaspberryPi instead.
Thus, I'm submitting new issue for this case.
