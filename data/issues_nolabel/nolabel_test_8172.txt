Get initialized value of variable without resetting

As far as I know, there is currently no way to get the current value of a variable while ensuring that it has been initialized once. tf.Variable.initialized_value() has a dependency on the initializer that causes the variable to be reset to its initial value every time it is accessed. Using return tf.cond(tf.is_variable_initialized(variable), lambda: variable.value(), lambda: variable.initialized_value()) does not work since the true-branch of the conditional requires the variable to be initialized, even though the false-branch becomes active.
