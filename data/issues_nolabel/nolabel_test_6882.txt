CPU version  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute ‘pack’

when I was trying training a fcn with the latest cpu version tensoflow,I got an error:

setting up vgg initialized conv layers ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "FCN.py", line 285, in 
tf.app.run()

deconv_shape3 = tf.pack([shape[0], shape[1], shape[2], NUM_OF_CLASSESS])
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'pack'

My tensorflow is installed from tensorflow-0.12.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl.  Seemingly there's no pack function of tf or in other module?
