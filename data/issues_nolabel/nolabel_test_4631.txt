GridRNN cell uses tuples for output and states

In response to this (#2560) and recent changes in LSTMCell, this PR added state_is_tuple=True and output_is_tuple=True into the constructor of GridRNNCell:
> cell = tf.contrib.grid_rnn.Grid2LSTMCell(3, use_peepholes=True)
> cell.state_size
       (LSTMStateTuple(c=3, h=3), LSTMStateTuple(c=3, h=3))
> cell.output_size
       (3,)

This means there are 2 LSTM cells in the grid, and the state of each cell has size of (c=3, h=3). There is only one output dimension, whose size is 3.
In contrast:
> cell = tf.contrib.grid_rnn.Grid2BasicRNNCell(3)
> cell.state_size
     (3, 3)
> cell.output_size
     (3,)

This means there are 2 BasicRNN cell in the grid, and the state of each cell has size of 3. There is only one output dimension, whose size is 3.
Previous behaviour is maintained by using state_is_tuple=False, output_is_tuple=False when creating the cell.
