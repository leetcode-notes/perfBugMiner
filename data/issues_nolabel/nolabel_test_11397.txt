Third-party Scala API Links in the Documentation

I added a couple links to my Scala API repository in the documentation pages. I'm not sure if it's in the expected format, but feel free to rephrase if needed.
It would be great if we could also add a link in the following page (I could not find it in the documentation sources): https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/.
Thanks!
EDIT: @asimshankar will take care of adding a link to https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/, so we're good with that one. Thanks! :)
