Tensorflow placeholders and exporting to c++

Hello everyone,
My TF installation is working fine, but I'm running into a serious issue when exporting my trained model to a c++ environment. I'm trying to do something similar to this tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html
I replaced the inception model with my own trained model, however, the graph won't run in c++. My own model is based on this tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html#deep-mnist-for-experts
It gives me this error:
Running model failed: Invalid argument: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'Placeholder' with dtype float
[[Node: Placeholder = Placeholderdtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]]
The problem appears to be the placeholders at the input layer of my model. The model expects a feed_dict for them, but I don't believe there is c++ API for defining feed_dicts? If placeholders cannot be used with c++ API, I wonder how I should set up the input layer of my model for use with c++.
Thanks!
