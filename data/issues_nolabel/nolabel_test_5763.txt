The TensorFlow operation concat_offset is undocumented

This shows up in some protocol buffers.  A vigorous search through the source code produced a short comment in some C++ code that gives some hints about its behaviour.  In particular, the word 'cumsum" was used.  There appears to be, at times, a second output argument produced, although I have no idea what that could be except a copy of the first output.
A lot of searching turned up nothing useful.
