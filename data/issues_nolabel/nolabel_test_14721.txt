Add back whitespace

When tfcompile_flags was changed so it could be not just a string but also a list of strings, the initial white space was erroneously removed (probably a misunderstanding of str.join) meaning --out_object= would consume the first flag.
E.g. this would no longer work:
tf_library(
  tfcompile_flags = "--target_cpu='core-avx2'"
)

While this would work:
tf_library(
  tfcompile_flags = " --target_cpu='core-avx2'"
)
