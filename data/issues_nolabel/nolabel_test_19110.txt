Describe the problem
I would like instructions on how to install Tensorflow Lite onto Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspbian Stretch OS. To the best of my knowledge, the documentation doesn't yet cover installation for Raspbian Stretch. I posted on the Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange (https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/83498/how-do-i-install-tensorflow-lite-on-raspbian-stretch) and I was directed here. My goal is to deploy a Tensorflow neural network onto the Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Tensorflow Lite.
