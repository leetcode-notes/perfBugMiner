Enable to pass feed_fn to fit method

There was no way to use fit method to pass feed_fn.
I tried to use fit method of learn.estimator.Estimator (actually the method is defined in its parent BaseEstimator).
Also I tried to use DataFeeder to feed data. I can use input_builder and get_feed_dict_fn() of DataFeeder instance to extract data. But when I tried to feed data to fit method, I couldn't pass feed_fn, extracted from DataFeeder.
This change add feed_fn keyword argument to fit method, to handle above situation.
