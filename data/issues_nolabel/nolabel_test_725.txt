Packages in ~/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image

If we take a look at perhaps ~/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_train.py, there's a line
from tensorflow.models.image.cifar10 import cifar10
This works perfectly, and since there's a init.py in each directory, it can be seen as somewhat a package. When I try to create my own projects in this directory, it does not work. For example:
~/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/my_project/, such that
my_project/
init.py
code1.py
code2.py
When I try to do the following in code1.py, it does not work:
from tensorflow.models.image.my_project import code2
*Another interesting to note, is that deleting all init.py in the various directories still allow tensorflow.models.image.cifar10 import cifar10 to work. There's something more to this that I'm not getting. Does anyone have this problem too?
**P.S. The init has two underscores in front and behind, the markdown removes it.
