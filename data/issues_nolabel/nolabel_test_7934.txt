Feature Request: Tranponse of separable_conv2d?

I am trying to implement transposed version of separable_conv2d probably name it separable_conv2d_transpose
The existing conv operations in TF for convolution are:
convolution
conv2d
depthwise_conv2d
depthwise_conv2d_native
separable_conv2d
atrous_conv2d
atrous_conv2d_transpose
conv2d_transpose
conv1d
conv3d
conv3d_transpose
conv2d_backprop_filter
conv2d_backprop_input
conv3d_backprop_filter_v2
depthwise_conv2d_native_backprop_filter
depthwise_conv2d_native_backprop_input

Does anyone know how to approach an implementation of the op, or better combine existing backprop filters to achieve the result?
