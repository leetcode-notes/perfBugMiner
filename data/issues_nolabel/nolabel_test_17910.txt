Timeline Logging Duplicates of Operations

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6.0-rc1
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.11.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.1/7.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla k80 (11441MiB)
Exact command to reproduce: python cifar10_train.py

Describe the problem
I used timeline to profile the time taken by each operation of the standard cifar10 model available in tensorflow/models repo. After looking at the logfile, it looks like logs of some of the operations are duplicated i.e. it looks like some of the operations in the graph are ran multiple times over the single run of the complete graph. For example, Operation "gradients/conv2/Conv2D_grad/Conv2DBackpropFilter" (link to logfile : https://gist.github.com/xilenteyex/d54305e0448e1aa3d878872c45b8ed3a#file-timeline-1-json-L2270) is logged multiple times. Is this some sort of bug or am I missing something?
Thanks a lot for looking into this issue!

here is a the link to my modified version of cifar10_train.py in which I added logging :
