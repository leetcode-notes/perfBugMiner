Update einsum to check whether uncompacted_shape has multiple None values

Fixes #6824.
It checks uncompacted_shape, which contains the 'final' shape of matmul of two tensors, if it contains two or more None values.
If uncompacted_shape contains two or more None values, it means that it cannot be directly given to reshape as parameter.
This PR resolves this issue, by querying the dimension value using tf.shape function for that case.
