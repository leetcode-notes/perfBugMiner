Update docs for tf.matching_files to mention non-deterministic

This fix tries to close the issue of #15374 by updating the
docs of tf.matching_files (as well as Dataset.list_files
and train.match_filenames_once), to mention that the file names
returned could be non-deterministic.
This fix fixes #15374.
