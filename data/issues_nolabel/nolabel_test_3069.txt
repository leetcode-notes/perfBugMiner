Installation issue with CUDA 8

Hi,
I've attempted to install Tensorflow with CUDA 8 on Ubuntu 14.04 by installing from source since it doesn't seem like there are binaries available (following https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#installing-from-sources)
Everything installed well, but once I tried importing, I received this while trying to import tensorflow in python:
ImportError: libcudart.so.7.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
I'm not sure where this is coming from, since I'm using CUDA 8.  I did have a previous installation of CUDA 7.5, but all those files got replaced, and there is no libcudart.so.7.5 (or anything 7.5) in the cuda lib64 folder.
Any thoughts? Many Thanks!

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
861644c
Steps to reproduce

Install NVIDIA 367 driver
Install CUDA 8.0
Install cuDNN 5.0
Reboot
Install tensorflow from source with bazel using the above configuration

What have you tried?

reconfiguring/reinstalling tensorflow with inputting the exact directory locations (instead of pressing ENTER for default), even if the default locations were already correct.
