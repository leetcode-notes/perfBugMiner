Can I use multiple CPU but none GPU on inception v3 code?

I have access to GPUs on the server, but the sysadmin has trouble on setting up CuDNN and CUDA, and I found when I use multi CPU on CIFAR-10 code, the speed was similar with GPUs.
So I wonder whether there is a way to use the inception code to train the ImageNet in a environment with multiple CPUs like 32 or 64 CPU cores but none GPU?
