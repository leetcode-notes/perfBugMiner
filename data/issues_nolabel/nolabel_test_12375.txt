Eager tensor execution not inferring dtype attributes

Hi,
I've noticed that when I use the "StridedSlice" op, for example, with the new eager tensor execution API, the type arguments ("T" and "Index" in this case) are not automatically inferred and the library complains that they are not provided. Also, when I do provide them, I get an error saying NodeDef mentions attr ', which I cannot figure out. @alextp maybe you have some idea of what's happening.
Thanks,
Anthony
