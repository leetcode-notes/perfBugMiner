DO NOT MERGE: Replaced python configuration by a Skylark Remote Repository

This is just an example on how to delete the ./configure script
with Skylark Remote Repository (available in Bazel @Head).
This was tested by building the pip package on OS X but should
be tested further on various platform.
Protobuf fast python header is deactivated because protobuf
needs to be updated to work correctly with that.
It should be pretty straightforward to do the same things for
cuda too.
