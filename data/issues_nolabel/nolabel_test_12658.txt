Support CopyFile with streaming

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #12641 where it was not possible to have CopyFile with streaming. The original implementation copies the whole content of the file to a string
buffer and write to the file. This could be an issue if the file size is too large (than the memory of the host).
This fix streams the CopyFile operation.
Also, sendfile is used if the file system is posix
This fix fixes #12641.
