[feature request] set some dimension in row_shape to the maximum in each batch in tf.contrib.data.Dataset.dense_to_sparse_batch

The docstring says:
row_shape: A tf.TensorShape or tf.int64 vector tensor-like
object representing the equivalent dense shape of a row in the
resulting tf.SparseTensor. Each element of this dataset must
have the same rank as row_shape, and must have size less
than or equal to row_shape in each dimension.
The row_shape must be the same for every batch, so if the elements are sequences it's necessary to know the maximum length beforehand. It would be nice if it was possible to set some dimension of row_shape to -1, meaning that this dimension will be the maximum for each batch (just like padded_batch).
