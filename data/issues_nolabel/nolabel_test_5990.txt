iOS: No OpKernel for Pow op

We're running a model on iOS and finding that the tf.pow Pow op is not supported; we added a line with tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_pow.cc to tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_op_files.txt, rebuild TensorFlow, and after that, the model worked.
Could this op be added to the iOS makefile so that in the future other folks do not run into this problem?
(I would submit a PR but this is at a company that has not signed the TensorFlow CLA so for such a small change it is not worth the hassle.)
