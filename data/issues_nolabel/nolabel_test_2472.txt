distributed tensorflow mnist example hang at prepare_or_wait_for_session()

I tried both Distributed tensorflow and minist_softmax.py.txt. They both hang at the prepare_or_wait_for_session() function with non-chief worker tasks.
task_index == 0(chief worker ) can run as expected.
I can not find out the reasion why it behaves like this.
Can anyone please give some advice?
