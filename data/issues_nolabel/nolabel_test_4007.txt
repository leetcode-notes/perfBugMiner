Request for TF example  "DeepMind : Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend"

Deepmind's paper:Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03340v3.pdf
will be a good example for RNN with attention.
However, an unofficial Tensorflow implementation has been suspended over 7 months.

Other theano implementations do not demonstrate how to visualize the attention weight:
