AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'streaming_accuracy'

accuracy = tf.streaming_accuracy (y_pred,y_true,name='acc')
recall = tf.streaming_recall (y_pred,y_true,name='acc')
precision = tf.streaming_precision(y_pred,y_true,name='acc')
confusion = tf.confuson_matrix(Labels, y_pred,num_classes=10,dtype=tf.float32,name='conf')

for the above code, I have received the same error in past few days.
Is the syntax same as its in the API documentation?
