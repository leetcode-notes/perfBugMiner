Any way to pass a feedable placeholder for num_spectrogram_bins  in linear_to_mel_weight_matrix?

I need to run auido->spectrogram->mel graph for three different frame sizes. Ideally, I would have frame_size input tensor of the stft function be a placeholder and feed it in a loop. However, when computing the mel scale, tf does a value check for the number of bins, which according to my understanding, means that the number of bins needs to be specified during the graph construction.
Any suggestions?
Below is the link to the problematic code

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/signal/python/ops/mel_ops.py
    
    
         Line 72

           if num_spectrogram_bins <= 0: 
        
    
  


Edit: I am referencing the official tutorial.
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.signal#Computing_log_mel_spectrograms
The very first line essentially begins the problem chain.
Edit: I just commented out the line below that initiates the value checks, and everything ran smoothly. I was able to feed in frame_length.
