TF Lite Documentation and Raspberry Pi Demo Request

Hi All,
I want to request further documentation for running TF Lite on a Raspberry Pi.
I was really impressed by the SSD demo shown by Andrew Selle during the TensorFlow Dev Summit and would love to see documentation to reimplement something like that.
At some point the tensorflow/contrib/lite/README.md stated something about a Raspberry Pi demo app coming soon, but it is no longer there. Is this something that you still plan to support?
Thanks!
