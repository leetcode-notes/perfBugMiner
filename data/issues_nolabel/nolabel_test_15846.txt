tf.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy

Hi,
it seems that there is a mistake in the api doc:
logits: Float [batch_size, num_classes] logits outputs of the network.
however it should be:
logits: Float [batch_size, num_classes] Unscaled log probabilities.
since it said it is going to "Creates a cross-entropy loss using tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits"
