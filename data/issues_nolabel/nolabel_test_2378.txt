Enable password support for Jupyter in a Docker image

This small update enables Jupyter to support passwords passed as an environment variable when instantianting a docker container.
In the same way, jupyter_notebook_config.py could also be modified to support HTTPS by default. If there is an interest, I could also include these updates in the same PR.
