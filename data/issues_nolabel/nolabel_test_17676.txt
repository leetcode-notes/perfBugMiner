Logging frequency hardcoded in tf.estimator

Describe the problem
The logging frequency of the default LoggingTensorHook of tf.Estimator is hardcoded to 100 steps (see lines 828-837 in [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.6/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py]). It would really help me to unclutter my logs if I had access to this value (my training is fast).
