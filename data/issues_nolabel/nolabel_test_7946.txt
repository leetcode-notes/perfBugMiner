(Saver.max_to_keep) should keep every checkpoint by default

I was wondering why my checkpoints were being deleted and it's only after looking up the behavior of Saver.max_to_keep in the docs that I understood what was happening. I think a better default setting for this is to keep all checkpoints, at least that's what I would have expected.
