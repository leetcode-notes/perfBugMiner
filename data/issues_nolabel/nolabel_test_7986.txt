tf.contrib.metrics.accuracy does not accept name

The tf.contrib.metrics.accuracy operation does not take in a name and instead is hardcoded to be accuracy:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/metrics/python/metrics/classification.py
    
    
         Line 55
      in
      a230417
    
    
    
    

        
          
           with ops.name_scope('accuracy', values=[predictions, labels]): 
        
    
  


signature should be:
def accuracy(predictions, labels, weights=None, name=None):

and then:
with ops.name_scope(name, 'accuracy', values=[predictions, labels]):
