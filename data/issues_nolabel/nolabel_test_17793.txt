unable to find libcuda.so

I can use  tensorflow to program, but have a problem:

2018-03-17 17:33:18.848935: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_diagnostics.cc:189] libcuda reported version is: Not found: was unable to find libcuda.so DSO loaded into this program

I can see my GPU by using nvidia-smi.
Anyone can help me to solve this ?
Thanks !
