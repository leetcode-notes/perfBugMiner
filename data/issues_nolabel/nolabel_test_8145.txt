tensorflow r1.0 does not report training speed in the log any more

I used tensorflow r0.10 before with contrib.learn.
When I set
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO)
after imports, I would get the following info from the training log:
INFO:tensorflow:Results after 10 steps (0.185 sec/batch): loss = 0.0644001, auc = 0.73555, accuracy/threshold_0.500000_mean = 0.988108
But with tensorflow r1.0, no such info in the training log any more.
Why is it removed? It is such a useful information.
or do I need to set something else in the script?
Thanks for help.
