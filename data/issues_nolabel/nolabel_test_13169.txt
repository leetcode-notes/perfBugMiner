nightly-devel-gpu Docker broken with ImportError: libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file

To reproduce:
sudo docker run -it --name t2 tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-devel-gpu
python -c "import tensorflow"
It's looking for libcuda.so.1, butÂ I can't find that file in the image
Furthermore, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is pointing to /usr/local/nvidia/lib64 but there's no such folder. There's /usr/local/cuda/lib64, but no libcuda.so.1 there either (should it be loading libcudart.so.8.0 instead?)
