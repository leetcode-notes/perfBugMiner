Implement variable length sequences for seq2seq

Now, seq2seq uses bucketing to deal with variable length sequences. Which need to define many models and require manually tuning.  While in RNN, some models implement variable length sequences with a param sequence_length, which I think is a better method. So how about use the same method in RNN to implement variable length sequences for seq2seq?
