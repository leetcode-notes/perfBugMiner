Show location of using uninitialized variable in the stacktrace

It's currently hard to debug initialization of multiple variables with initial values depending on each other:
a = tf.Variable(42)
b = tf.Variable(some_function(a.value()))
The current error message has the form FailedPreconditionError (see above for traceback): Attempting to use uninitialized value a and the traceback points to sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()). However, the place for fixing this problem is the declaration of b:
a = tf.Variable(42)
b = tf.Variable(some_function(a.initialized_value()))
Would it be possible to add the line that defines the uninitialized access to the traceback?
