Extracting weight values from output_graph.pb

Hi, this isn't a bug more of request for a tutorial or guidance -  I have asked this question multiple times on Stackoverflow  and can't seem to get any responses nor views. My past questions on tensorflow also didn't get much views on Stackoverflow -- I think this is because tensorflow is still relatively new and it's hard to find knowledgeable people.
I'm sorry to post, here but I don't know where else to ask -- I've been at it for a few days and looked
the tutorials on the official site but I couldn't find any.
I used inceptionV-3 for transfer learning  and now I have a output_graph.pb.
I want to extract all the weights and biases for each layer, but I can't seem to find a way to do this.
I've gone over most the tutorials in tensorflow:
https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model#models
And most blogs or stackoverflows posts show how to deal with 'metaandckpt` graphs.
but not on pb graphs.
I've attempted this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46696859/tf-graphkeys-trainable-variables-on-output-graph-pb-resulting-in-empty-list
def create_graph(modelFullPath):
    """Creates a graph from saved GraphDef file and returns a saver."""
    # Creates graph from saved graph_def.pb.
    with tf.gfile.FastGFile(modelFullPath, 'rb') as f:
        graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

GRAPH_DIR = r'C:\tmp\output_graph.pb'
create_graph(GRAPH_DIR)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    all_vars = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES)
    print (len(all_vars))

But I'm getting a value of 0 -- so empty return.
I've also attempted using freeze_graph.py  after cloning tensorflow repository but couldn't understand all of the arguments (created a stackoverflow question on this as well)
--input_graph    = path to the graph I want to extract.
I'm assuming the above arugument is all I need to use?
However when running this command:
python3.6 C:\Users\Moondra\tensorflow\tensorflow\python\tools\freeze_graph.py --input-graph=C:\tmp\output_graph.pb
I'm getting a import error which is confusing me as well:
from tensorflow.python.tools import saved_model_util
     importError: cannot import name 'saved_model_utils'

I've cloned the repository properly and the saved_model_utils is within the tools folder, so not sure
why I"m getting an import error.
Any help would be appreciated, and once again, sorry for posting here.  :(
