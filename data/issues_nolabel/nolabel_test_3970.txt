update instructions for Raspberry Pi

Hi Tensorflow team,
when installing on a fresh Raspberry Pi, I noticed that I also had to install a couple additional packages. These two lines were taken from the Linux instructions, and were verified by me (and additionally a friend of mine), when we've both started building it on a new Raspbian system.
Everything else worked perfectly, thanks for the excellent documentation!
