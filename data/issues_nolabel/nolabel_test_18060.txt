Tensorflow lite c++ shared library include headers file

Hi ,
1.I build tensorflowlite.so library as describe in #16219
2.I added lib to my Android studio project.
3.In C++ class header I added
#include "tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/register.h"
#include "tensorflow/contrib/lite/model.h"
#include "tensorflow/contrib/lite/string_util.h"
#include "tensorflow/contrib/lite/tools/mutable_op_resolver.h"
4.Error compilation :
  ../../../../../../../3rdparty/tensorflow/tf_lite/tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema/schema_generated.h:21:37: fatal error: flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h: No such file or directory
   #include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"
                                       ^
  compilation terminated.
  ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.

Please advise how to resolve it,
Thanks.
