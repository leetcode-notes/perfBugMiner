Polygamma and zeta function for tensorflow

The polygamma function is necessary to evaluate the derivative of the digamma function which is already supported by tensorflow. As suggested by @ebrevdo in #291, I have ported the code for the two-parameter zeta function from cephes which allows us to evaluate the polygamma function. A pull request for eigen is here.
What is the best way to proceed integrating the new functionality into tensorflow? I'm happy to contribute the code with a bit of input regarding the right procedure. In particular, how do you update the eigen sources within the tensorflow repo?
