Different padding boundaries for different directions.

Hello,
I recently started to use TensorFlow to implement and idea using 3D convolutions. It requires me to use different padding boundary conditions along spatial and temporal directions (dimensions) of the tensor (I need padding='SAME' for spatial and padding='VALID' for temporal directions).  tf.nn.conv3d and tf.nn.max_pool3d specify padding for the operation as a whole.
Is there any way to specify padding type for each dimension individually, like how the stride is specified? I don't mind contributing for this if necessary, if someone could direct me on how to add this feature or create a new op for it.
