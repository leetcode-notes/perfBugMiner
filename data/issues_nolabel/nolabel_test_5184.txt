Can't run iOS makefile on MacOS Sierra, required file 'build-aux/ltmain.sh' not found

Well from now on I should probably think twice before I update. Before it used to work correctly but now I get this message when i run compile_ios_protobuf.sh
+ ./autogen.sh
+ autoreconf -f -i -Wall,no-obsolete

I hav MacOS Sierra installed and Xcode 8. If anyone has a workaround for this please let me know.
