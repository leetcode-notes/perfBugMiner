I want to use ctc_loss to do gesture recognition. But I keep getting error message that Labels length is zero at batch 0. I can't figure out the problem. So come here for help.
The data I feed into ctc_loss are listed in the following table
tensname                    type                      dimension
labels                  sparsetensor         batch_size(5) x label_length(1)
sequence_predicts         tensor                  time_steps(10) x batch_size(5) x num_classes(26)
sequence_lengths          tensor                  batch_size(5)

I create ctc_loss with the following code
loss = tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels,sequence_predicts,sequence_lengths,time_major = True);
I print all input tensors with the following code
denselabels = tf.sparse_to_dense(labels.indices,labels.dense_shape,labels.values);
denselabels = tf.Print(denselabels,[denselabels],message = "labels = ", summarize = 20, name = "denselabels");
sequence_predicts = tf.Print(sequence_predicts,[sequence_predicts],message = "sequence_predicts = ", summarize = 20, name = "sequence_predicts");
sequence_lengths = tf.Print(sequence_lengths,[sequence_lengths],message = "sequence_lengths = ", summarize = 200, name = "sequence_lengths");
The output on the console is
sequence_lengths = [10 10 10 10 10]
labels = [[1][2][1][0][0]]
sequence_predicts = [[[0.0183351934 -0.0540067367 0.0173245296 0.10416019 -0.06072326 -0.0563994423 0.00676568877 -0.046640303 -0.0107666068 0.0554158054 0.0658506081 0.0124566173 0.0133351646 0.0134876268 -0.0453479 -0.058809232 0.0160786062 -0.0285613891 -0.105710872 0.0354634598]]...]
