Trouble installing as well as uninstalling Tensorflow

So as you can see here we have python and anaconda
Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:04:09) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Then installed Tensorflow using pip3 and tfBinaryURL eventually testing the installation-
>>> #python
... import tensorflow as tf
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
>>> 

So I tried uninstalling Tensorflow using pip uninstall tensorflow but again after the y/n prompt (typed "y")
Installing collected packages: tensorflow
 Found existing installation: tensorflow 1.3.0
 Uninstalling tensorflow-1.3.0:
Exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/shutil.py", line 544, in move
   os.rename(src, real_dst)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

this happens.

If it's pre-installed as it says ideally the program #1 should work - but it doesn't.
Can you help, please?
