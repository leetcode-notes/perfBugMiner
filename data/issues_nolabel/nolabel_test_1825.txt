Various matrix triangular functions.

A feature request.
At the moment as far as I'm aware TensorFlow doesn't have equivalents of the following numpy functionality:


np.tril: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.tril.html and similarly
np.triu: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.triu.html


np.tril_indeces http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.tril_indices.html and the upper triangular equivalent and the ability to assign to a tensor using them.


The ability to convert a vector to a lower or upper triangular square matrix which blas has.


This sort of thing is useful for instance in linear algebra usages of TensorFlow.
I am unaware of an easy work around for these but I would be happy to be wrong.
