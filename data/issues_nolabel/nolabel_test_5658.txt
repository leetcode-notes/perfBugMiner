Produce binary release tarballs for the TensorFlow C API

These scripts are intended to be run with every release to
produce libtensorflow.tar.gz for CPU and GPU on Linux and OS X
for x86_64 architecture machines.
(Eventually there will be other operating systems and architectures).
These binary releases are then intended to make use of other language
bindings (such as Rust, Haskell, Go) easier
as the common case would be to download the binary C-library release and
avoid the need to build TensorFlow from source (and all the time and
external dependencies doing so entails).
Files:

tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/libtensorflow.sh - Baseline common script to build a tarball
tensorflow/osx/libtensorflow_{cpu,gpu}.sh - Build tarballs for OS X with and without GPU support
tensorflow/linux: Has similar top level scripts, but the build happens in a docker container so it contains 4 files - the two top level builds, one shared libtensorflow_docker.sh that is used to build and execute the docker container and libtensorflow.sh which is the script run inside the container.
