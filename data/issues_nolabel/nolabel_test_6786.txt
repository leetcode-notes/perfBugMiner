Variable "matching_filenames" @  tf.train.match_filenames_once() should be local?

This var holds the matched file names for the input stream pipeline.
Since it is added to the graph, when using the contractor of tf.train.Saver() it is saved
as part of the checkpoint state.
Hence loading saved models from checkpoints for inference, the training file names are loaded instead of the val / inference files.
Shouldn't this Var become a local variable? will it not be saved by default treated as local?
