Updated adding_an_op.md to reflect newer API and to fix typos

Changes made to adding_an_op.md:

Typos:

changed #include "example.h" to "kernel_example.h" in the .cc and .cu.cc files (under the GPU kernels heading)
changed #endif KERNEL_EXAMPLE_H_ to #endif // KERNEL_EXAMPLE_H_ in .h file


API updates:

changed calls from tf.sysconfig.get_compile_flags() to tf.sysconfig.get_include(), and get_link_flags() to get_lib() (under Compile the op using your system compiler and Compiling the kernel for GPU device headings)
changed variables TF_CFLAGS and TF_LFLAGS to TF_INC and TF_LIB accordingly


Bug fixes (to files under GPU kernels heading):

added missing call to REGISTER_OP macro in .cc file
corrected partial specialization of functor template in .h file
added #include "third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor" to .cc file



The last two bullet points are fixes I had to make to my local copies of the files in order for the compilation process to work; if there is a better way to fix the files, please let me know. To that end, the files as described above will compile, but on my machine, the GPU implementations are inaccessible. If anyone would be so kind, I've posted about it on Stack Overflow. Thanks!
