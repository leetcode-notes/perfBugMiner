Module not found: tensorflow  Running Docker Jupyter OSX

After installing docker, I attempted to run tensorflow in Jupyter. My run command was
LewIss-MacBook-Pro:MyTensorFlow lewleib$  docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -v ~/Users/lewleib/MyTensorFlow:/notebooks tensorflow/tensorflow`
In the Jupyter notebook I ran
import tensorflow as tf     
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')     
sess = tf.Session()     
print(sess.run(hello) 

This resulted in
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
I have tried starting in different directories and added prefix gcr.io with the same results. Thanks
