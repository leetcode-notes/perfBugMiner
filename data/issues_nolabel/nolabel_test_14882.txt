What if we don't install tensorflow under a new environment?

How come we need to install tensorflow as a separate environment?
If we do it this way, many common libraries are not available when tensorflow is activated.

Most of the common libraries such as matplotlib, panda, etc. are not within tensorflow environment. So we have to install again to use them.

So why not just install under root so we don't have to re-install all those libraries under the new environment?
Thanks.
