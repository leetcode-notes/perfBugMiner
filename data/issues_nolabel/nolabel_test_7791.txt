glorot_uniform_initializer and others not exported

Many initializers defined in init_ops are not exported in the global TensorFlow package. These include:

glorot_uniform_initializer (this is even explicitly mentioned in the docs as the default initializer for variables)
glorot_normal_initializer
variance_scaling_initializer

It seems like this might be an oversight â€“ glorot_uniform_initializer is mentioned in existing documentation, and glorot_normal_initializer has no other hits in the code base, which makes it seem like it's for user consumption.

Similar initializers are available in tf.contrib.layers, but it seems preferable to use the ones that already exist in core.
