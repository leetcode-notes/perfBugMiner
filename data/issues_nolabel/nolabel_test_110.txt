Support for Redhat, Centos and many superclusters

Many clusters system using module with Redhat or Centos < 7 which is glibc 2.12
Since, bazel requires glibc 2.14 and the prebuilt version for linux requires glibc 2.17. It is hopeless to make tensorflow run on clusters.
Referred to this issue reported on bazel: bazelbuild/bazel#583
