Added SNAPPY support in CMake scripts

Windows CMake builds do not include SNAPPY compression library support, thus the resulting applications are not able to parse TensorFlow models that were compressed with SNAPPY.
This pull request adds SNAPPY as ExternalProject, just as it's done with all other 3rd party libraries.
Unfortunately I cannot verify this on a Linux machine right now, so option is disabled for Linux by default.
There is a relevant Stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45304986/cant-read-saved-tensorflow-model-failed-to-seek-to-header-entry
Example command line to build snappy as a part of TF:
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -Dtensorflow_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF -Dtensorflow_ENABLE_GRPC_SUPPORT=OFF -Dtensorflow_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=ON -Dtensorflow_ENABLE_SNAPPY_SUPPORT=ON
MSBuild /p:PreferredToolArchitecture=x64 /p:Configuration=Release snappy.vcxproj

This is my first contribution, so I apologize in advance for any guidelines I might have violated. Feedback is appreciated üëç
