http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz no longer available

I'm attempting to install tensorflow 0.12.1 from the r0.12 branch from source.
zlib has been updated from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9 so it appears the link must be updated from:
http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
edit: per later comments, this has been moved to http://zlib.net/fossils/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
one solution may be to update to:
http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz
here is the error I'm getting:
INFO: Starting clean (this may take a while). Consider using --expunge_async if the clean takes more than several minutes.

In addition to the breakage fix, perhaps it would also make sense to make a change that would prevent future breakage of this sort?
