Possible bug in inception_v1 in slim networks library

This question is probably not relevant to this issue. I did a Google search and didn't find any.
Environment info
Operating System:
Windows 7 - 64 bit

The inception_v1.py in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets/inception_v1.py, the inception layer is different from the paper. In the paper there is a 3x3 conv2d and a 5x5 conv2d module. I see that other frameworks have a 5x5 module and only here there are 2 3x3 modules instead.
Is this intentional or a bug ?
