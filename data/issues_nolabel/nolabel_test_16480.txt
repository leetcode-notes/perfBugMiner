CMake adopt to latest eager runtime and reusable shared library in windows environment

Due to some error in CLA checking #16394, a new pull request is made
I am currently working on the cmake files to generate shared library that allows users to develop with C++ interface.
It is easier to develop by adding export targets in tf_shared_lib.cmake, but I think in the future this function should be migrated to the main CMakeList.txt
