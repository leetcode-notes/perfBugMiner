What's the difference between Univariate prediction and Multivariate prediction?

My understanding is that paramenters of neurals are shared in Multivariate prediction and they can learn some correlations between series. There is less training time in Multivariate prediction. I wonder if that's right. Could you please explain any basic principles of Multivariate prediction with LSTM or recommend related papers to me? Thank you.
