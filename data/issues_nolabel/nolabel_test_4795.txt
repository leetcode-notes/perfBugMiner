Make //tensorflow/cc:cc_ops compile for Android

It seems that the bazel target //tensorflow/cc:cc_ops is currently not compilable for Android. From what I saw, this is at least because of the missing platform specific headers (e.g. in tensorflow/core/platform/gif.h).
Making the cc_ops compilable for Android would allow to fully use tensorflow on Android. In particular, I'm trying to build tensorflow for Android with the operations to be able to provide javacpp-presets which allow an automated generation of complete Java bindings. Therefore they can be used to completely omit the jni/C++ code in Android applications that want to use tensorflow.
