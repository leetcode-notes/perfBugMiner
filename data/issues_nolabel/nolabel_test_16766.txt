with tf.control_dependencies fails on return

Hello,
here is an undesired behavior:
fails

with tf.control_dependencies([check_num_pnt]):
out_feat = seg_sum
return out_feat

works

with tf.control_dependencies([check_num_pnt]):
out_feat = seg_sum * 1.0
return out_feat

ps: I should have said fails on copied tensor
