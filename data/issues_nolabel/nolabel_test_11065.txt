Unable to install TensorFlow properly on windows for python. Please help!

I am trying to install TensorFlow on Windows 10 for Python 3.5 64 bit. It says "successfully installed" but when I test it using "import tensorflow as tf" command in the command prompt, it shows a long error saying "DLL load failed" and "failed to load native tensorflow runtime".
I had tried installing it earlier but it didn't work. When I uninstalled from cmd: pip uninstall tensorflow, it said "successfully uninstalled". But when I try reinstalling, it says, "requirement already satisfied" and gives the same long error (DLL load failed etc.) when i type "import tensorflow as tf". This doesn't make sense. Please help.
Please see images.
