tf.while example is not working in eager mode

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes, see below

Describe the problem
tf.while example is not working in eager mode
Source code / logs
Here is the code
import tensorflow as tf
tf.enable_eager_execution() # the only line added to the example

i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
b = lambda i: tf.add(i, 1)
r = tf.while_loop(c, b, [i])
result:
TypeError: Cannot iterate over a scalar tensor.
Reason
b = lambda i: tf.add(i, 1)       # original
b = lambda i: (tf.add(i, 1), )   # fixed, working 

Body code (b) returns a single scalar, which code later tries to unpack.
Eager code doesn't support auto-wrapping single item to tuple

Possible solutions:

require body function to always return tuple
always check if body output is a single variable
