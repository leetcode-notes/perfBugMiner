Exceptions for nest._recursive_assert_same_structure

I see nest._recursive_assert_same_structure is used as a validator that makes sure that two nested sequences have same structure. However, due to its direct use of zip(nest1, nest2), it doesn't make any error in this simple case.
_recursive_assert_same_structure([[1,2,3], [2,3,[4]]], [[1,2,3,3,4,5]], False)
It can give ValueError when the second argument is changed as  below.
_recursive_assert_same_structure([[1,2,3], [2,3,[4]]], [1,2,3,3,4,5], False)
=> ValueError: The two structures don't have the same nested structure. First structure: [1, 2, 3], second structure: 1.
