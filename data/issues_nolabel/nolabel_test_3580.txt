What have you tried?

The StackOverflow question here suggested uninstalling protobuf and reinstalling it with a version greater than or equal to 3.0.0a3. However, when I ran pip uninstall protobuf, I got this output:
Can't uninstall 'protobuf'. No files were found to uninstall.
I then tried to just run pip install protobuf, however, this was the output:

Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from protobuf)
Cleaning up...

I then tried to run pip install 'protobuf>=3.0.0a3' as suggested on the StackOverflow thread, but this was the output:
Downloading/unpacking protobuf>=3.0.0a3

Storing debug log for failure in /home/me/.pip/pip.log

Some answers have suggested uninstalling and reinstalling TensorFlow along with protobuf, but I haven't tried that yet, since I wanted to avoid possibly messing anything up.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(output when I tried to run bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir ~/flower_photos)
