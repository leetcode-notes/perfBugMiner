Feature suggestion: expose weights for RNNCell

I realize that the API for RNNs hasn't been finalized yet but eventually it would be nice if the weights of the RNNCell are exposed so that they can be tracked using the summary ops like histogram_summary. Maybe just a property that returns all the internal weights.
