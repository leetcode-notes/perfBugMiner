Bug or feature - Confusing shapes of Tensor resulted from `tf.decode_csv`

reader = tf.TextLineReader()
key, value = reader.read(filename_queue)
parsed = tf.decode_csv(value, [[0.0]] * 24)
label = parsed[0]
weight = parsed[1]
feature = tf.pack(parsed[2:])
label_tensor, weight_tensor, feature_tensor = tf.train.shuffle_batch(
      [label, weight, feature],
      batch_size=200,
      capacity=capacity,
      min_after_dequeue=min_after_dequeue,
      num_threads=num_threads)
print("Parsed tensors: %s, %s, %s" % )

The shapes of label_tensor, weight_tensor and feature_tensor are (200, ), (200, ) and (200, 22) respectively.
If we put an extra comma at the end of line 4 and 5, like this:
label = parsed[0],
weight = parsed[1],

Then the shapes become (200, 1), (200, 1) and (200, 26) respectively.
So an extra comma determines the shape of the resulted tensor. I am not quite familiar with Python and am new to TensorFlow, but is it supposed so?
