[Issue 11241] Add checkpoint_convert.py script to package and make _RNN_NAME_REPLACEMENTS public.

As requested in #11241 , this PR adds the script https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py to the TensorFlow pip package and removes the leading underscore from the name of _RNN_NAME_REPLACEMENTS to indicate that this constant can be used by user code.
Testing done:

Verified that checkpoint_convert.py is not included in the package prior to this change.
Verified that checkpoint_convert.py is included in the package after this change.
Verified that checkpoint_convert.py does not complain about missing imports when invoked from the command line after installing the pip package.
Ran unit tests in contrib/rnn after the change.
