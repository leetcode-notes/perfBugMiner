tf.control_dependencies does not work with variable initializer for read_value?

Consider this code:
def test_var_init():
  v = tf.Variable(initial_value=2, trainable=False, name="test_var_init")
  with tf.control_dependencies([v.initializer]):
    x = v.read_value()
  assert x.eval() == 2

It should always succeed. However, it stochastically fails (maybe in about 75% of the runs or so), with the error:
FailedPreconditionError: Attempting to use uninitialized value test_var_init
         [[Node: test_var_init/_0 = _Send[T=DT_INT32, client_terminated=false, recv_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:0", send_device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0", send_device_incarnation=1, tensor_name="edge_5_test_var_init", _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](test_var_init)]]

TensorFlow v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d, 1.2.0, installed via pip, on Ubuntu 16.04 Linux.
It only seems to happen with GPU.
I think on TF 1.1 and earlier this worked, although maybe for some reason the probability to fail was much lower there and I didn't notice it.
