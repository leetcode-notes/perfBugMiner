Possibility to compile Tensorflow Native C++ Library to support Windows 10 UWP?

Hello all,
When I was checking Deep Learning framework for Windows 10 UWP development, somehow I came into this: https://anyline.com/news/tensorflow-implem/
It was not hard to see their UWP example app as well: https://github.com/Anyline/anyline-ocr-examples-windows-uwp
Which really brings up the question: Is it possible to compile the Tensorflow C++ library to add support for Windows 10 UWP development now? Or at least to get some codes enough for the Model Evaluation to work? Since it has been achieved by others. Some similar cases are like OpenCV, Numpy, etc. It can be really tricky solving dependencies and other unknown issues, but since it's done before there's hope?
Many thanks in advance!
