[FeatureRequest] Decode gzipped files in tf.FixedLengthRecordReader

My dataset is stored in binary format that is easily compressible (from 100 MB down to ~0.5 MB), but I currently cannot make use of this in TF, unless I write a TFRecords file, which is way more cumbersome and leads to a lot of duplication -- I need to work with those files in other programs as well, so the binary format is the easiest solution for me. It would be nice if  tf.FixedLengthRecordReader would support on-the-fly decompression.
