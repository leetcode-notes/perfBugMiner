Problems on the doc of install cudnn on Ubuntu and OS X

The docs on install CUDA on Ubuntu as well as OS X says that we need to set CUDA_HOME as described in the NVIDIA documentation as following, however, I cannot find any NVIDIA official documentation on how to set CUDA_HOME, could anyone provide this doc so that we can make the doc better?

Ensure that you create the CUDA_HOME environment variable as described in the NVIDIA documentation.

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
