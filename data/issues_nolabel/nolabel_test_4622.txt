Contributing to TF

My apology if I am posting this in a wrong place.
I was wondering if I have a valid bug fix or improvement to TF, and I want to test it before submitting a PR, what's the fastest way of doing it?
I usually use
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

to re-set up TF but it always takes too much time.
Thanks
