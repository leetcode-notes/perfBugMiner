Environment info
Operating System:
centos6.5   , tensorflow 0.11.0 without gpu(cpu only)
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
tf.train.Saver(max_to_keep = 5)
then
saver.save(sess, checkpoint_file, global_step=step)

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
IMPORTANT
I run the same code in my laptop, it's right with only 5 latest checkponits
but in the centos server , it generate unlimited checkponits files and the disk almost full
