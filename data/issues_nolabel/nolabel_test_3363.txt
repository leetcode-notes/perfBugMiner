embeddings tutorial has dead link to googlecode svn

The page:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/word2vec/index.html#evaluating-embeddings-analogical-reasoning
Has a dead (404) link to https://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/questions-words.txt
I'd submit a PR if I knew where it should point, but I don't :)
