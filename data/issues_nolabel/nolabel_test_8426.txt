Windows: Fix TensorFlow Bazel build

Remove explict reference to nodejs binary
@org_nodejs//:bin/node doesn't work on Windows, since it's supposed to
be @org_nodejs//:node.exe

Fix Bazel build after #8217



Use COMPILER_MSVC instead of PLATFORM_WINDOWS, because the latter one
is only defined in tf_copts. Some targets don't have tf_copts will fail to
build, eg. //tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc:grpc_remote_master
Add TF_COMPILE_LIBRARY in tf_copts

Fix the pip package dependencies in Bazel build (due to eb8bb9e)


Remove some targets that doesn't build yet.
After bazelbuild/bazel#2088 is fixed,
//tensorflow/tensorboard is buildable now.


Remove python tests than are already deleted from bazel_test_lib.sh
