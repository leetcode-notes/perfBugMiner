Build fails on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, CUDA Toolkit 8.0, cuDNN 5.0.5, and Bazel 0.3.0-jdk7

Hi Everyone,
I've downgraded my gcc to 5.3.0 by building from source in order to install CUDA Toolkit 8.0 with cuDNN 5.0.5. I also installed OpenCL freeglut3 and mesa libraries via apt-get. I then built Bazel from source using the installer script. Next, I installed the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Platform Python dependencies. I then cloned the tensorflow GitHub repository and modified the CROSSTOOL file variable cxx_builtin_include_directory to include the gcc location for 5.3.0. I then ran ./configure with default settings and tried to build with Bazel, but it always fails with an error like this, which appears to be a gcc issue:
WARNING: /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/fbc06f9baef46cade6e35d9e4137e37c/external/protobuf/WORKSPACE:1: Workspace name in /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/fbc06f9baef46cade6e35d9e4137e37c/external/protobuf/WORKSPACE (@main) does not match the name given in the repository's definition (@protobuf); this will cause a build error in future versions.

Target //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer failed to build
If I change the gcc version to 4.8 (installed via apt-get) in ./configure and revert CROSSTOOL I get many warnings:
INFO: ... warning: variable 'parsed_colon' set but not used
This warning is followed by an error:
ERROR: /opt/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:1527:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//tensorflow/core/kernels:depth_space_ops_gpu':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/core/kernels/spacetodepth_op_gpu.cu.cc':

'/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include/host_defines.h'
'/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include/driver_types.h'
...
This time, it appears to be an issue with CUDA Toolkit 8.0. Everything seems to work flawlessly up until building tensorflow from source.
Thanks,
