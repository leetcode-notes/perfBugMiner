Update gemmlowp version for cmake build

The gemmlowp has been updated in bazel, though cmake version was not updated. This fix updates
gemmlowp in cmake so that cmake and bazel versions are synced.
NOTE: Due to a Windows compilation issue, upstream changes is needed. I have created a upstream PR in gemmlowp repo which has been merged:
google/gemmlowp#135
Because of the above changes, this PR updates both cmake and bazel version at the same time, to sync up and make sure the behaviors are the same.
