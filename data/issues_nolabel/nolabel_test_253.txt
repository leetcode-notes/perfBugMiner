Need help, how to choose one column of a tensor

predict_op = tf.argmax(py_x, 1) # at predict time, evaluate the argmax of the logistic regression
here what to do if I want to choose one column of py_x, like py_x[1] ?
Also it would be of great help if we have example of showing how to do text classification using tensorflow( sparse feature).
Example of showing how to evaluate using auc instead of  precision is greatly appreciated.
