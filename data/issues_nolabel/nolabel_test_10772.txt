Changing context search for BiasAddGrad rewrite from BFS to stricter check

Current approach for rewriting BiasAddGrad node searches the backward data-flow of BiasAddGrad for MatMul or Conv2D node, whatever is found earlier is considered as the context for rewriting BiasAddGrad.  We discovered that this approach is not robust, so we are changing it to rely on a much stricter and robust check for context search.
