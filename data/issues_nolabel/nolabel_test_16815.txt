Update tensorboard dependency to 1.6.0+ and new name

TensorBoard for versions 1.6.0+ will use the tensorboard name on PyPI rather than the previous tensorflow-tensorboard name.  Unfortunately PyPI/pip have no notion of package "renames" so it will look like an unrelated dependency, i.e. users doing an upgrade will wind up with both names installed, although the new tensorboard package will overwrite the old one functionally speaking.
Let me know if you think it's worth mentioning this in the release notes.
Note that the new name currently just has TB 1.6.0-rc0 on PyPI but we should have the 1.6.0 final release out in a couple days, before TF 1.6.0 is published.
