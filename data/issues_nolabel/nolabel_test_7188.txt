Unexpected behavior after updating a placeholder

The output of the following snippet
ph = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
ph += 1000
a = ph + 0
init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess.run(init)
print(sess.run([a], {ph: 5}))

is [5], and not [1005] as could be expected.
Perhaps it's because placeholders can't be evaluated, and therefore TF ignores the update op of ph?
