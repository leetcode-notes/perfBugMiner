TensorBoard Image download fails if I expand some node before download

TensorBoard seems unable to download flow diagram picture if before download picture I expand some node. In the save picture window the name of picture isn't generated, appears a generic "download" filename, and if I click "save", download starts but fails instantly.

Tensorflow v 1.0.0
Windows 10 x64
