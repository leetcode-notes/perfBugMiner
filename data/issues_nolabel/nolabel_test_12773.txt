Halted-partial dataset download for speech_commands example renders example ~broken

If a user attempts to run tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py for the first time against a new data_dir location and then halts the execution of Python before the download can finish, subsequent attempts to run the script using the same data_dir specification (or lack of specification) will result in Python exiting in error with the gzip libraries complaining about incorrect CRC value.
This is because AudioProcessor.maybe_download_and_extract_dataset(...) in tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/input_data.py only downloads if the file doesn't already exist (sensibly) and assumes that tarfile.open(...).extractall(...) will complete error-free (less sensibly) - which it won't on the partially downloaded gzipped-tar asset.
This probably merits a documentation inclusion as opposed to a code re-write since it's example code, but that decision is above my pay-grade.
