./configure cannot find Python libraries

I can't get the configure step to work:
(py35) [david@SQUIDS tensorflow]$ ./configure 
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /home/david/.virtualenvs/py35/bin/python]: 
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N] n

The system is Fedora Linux with Python 3.5 installed in a virtualenv. Giving it
/home/david/.virtualenvs/py35/lib64/python3.5 seems to work, but I can't be sure (it is stuck trying to download http://pilotfiber.dl.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.61.0/boost_1_61_0.tar.gz, but with Firefox I can get it in 5 s).
