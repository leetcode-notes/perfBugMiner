Getting Started variable name mismatch

In http://tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage.md#variables
the variable in the example is initialized as var, then subsequently referred to as state
leading to an obvious NameError:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./variables.py", line 8, in <module>
    new_value = tf.add(state, one)
NameError: name 'state' is not defined
