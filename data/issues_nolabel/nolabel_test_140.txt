Questions about using LSTM

Hi. I am a newbie on TensorFlow, just like most of the others here.
I was trying to use the LSTM modules, and some questions arose.

How can I cope with non-fixed length of sequences? For example, the length of longest sentence in each batch is different, but in RNN tutorial, it does like

for i in range(len(num_steps)):
# The value of state is updated after processing each batch of words.
output, state = lstm(words[:, i], state)
....
when this "num_steps" is not set, what kind of value or variable can I use?

How can I use mask in LSTM? within a batch, all the sentences have different length, so it is essential to mask the lstm results according to the length of each sentence. I don't think there is masking function inside TensorFlor LSTM module. What options do I have?

Sorry for bothering you, and thank you for making public this great project.
