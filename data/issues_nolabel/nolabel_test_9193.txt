Support int32 idxs in sparse_tensor_dense_matmul

The sparse_tensor_dense_mat_mul operator requires indices to be stored in 64bit precision, which can end up consuming a lot of memory for large arrays.  This adds support for 32bit indices.
Note that I only changed gen_sparse_ops._sparse_tensor_dense_mat_mul, not sparse_ops.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul.  This makes this change fairly invisible, only accessible to those who know to look for it.  Changing the public facing function would require changing SparseTensor to accept 32bit indices, which might be a good thing to do but would be a much larger change.
