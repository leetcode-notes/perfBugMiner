Tensorflow Windows 64bit build for Python 2.7

Dear All,
I happened to have seemingly successfully built tensorflow 1.3.1 (CPU only) for Python 2.7 64bit with Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.
Apart from numerous minor manual tweaks, the main things that I had to do are the following:

modify tensorflow-1.3.1\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\tools\create_def_file.py
modify tensorflow-1.3.1\tensorflow\tools\git\gen_git_source.py.
modify some of the automatically generated *.py files.
copy some folders like tensorflow\core\profiler to tensorflow\python\profiler for the final distribution package.
add blank init.py files in some folders for the final distribution package.
translate some Cmake build routines to Matlab (as it was easier for me to debug, :p )

I have tested some example codes and found to be running as expected. I however believe to make thorough tests to claim whether my build is 100% okay or not.
I have found in different forums that many users had struggled to build for Python 2.7 64bit in Windows and even if built, ended up with import errors, missing files, etc. I don't know whether they had finally succeeded or not.
So, for those who are really desperate to have one, I have shared the wheel package here.
Please beware that there is a high possibility of ABI mismatch, if used.
Acknowledgement: I would like to acknowledge Wingware for providing me a professional license for Wing IDE, which I have used, and in general use, extensively for debugging purposes in Python.
