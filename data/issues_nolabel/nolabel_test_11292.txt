Return output_graph_def in tools/freeze_graph.py

It makes sense that def freeze_graph works with files for both the input graph and frozen output graph.
It does not make sense that def freeze_graph_with_def_protos only uses a tf.GraphDef for the input, but doesn't actually return the frozen graph (and instead only writes it to a file).
This pull request changes freeze_graph_with_def_protos to optionally write the output to file (for backwards-compatibility) when output_graph is set as usual, but also returns the GraphDef protobuf to make the API more symmetric.
Otherwise you have to write and read from a tempfile just to use freeze_graph, which is a hassle.
