[install problem] Tensorflow with Anaconda on Ubuntu

On my Ubuntu 14.04, I have installed tensorflow from source, as specified in the Tensorflow Installation instructions and it works well.
Then I install anaconda but it changes the $PATH environment variable, so I cannot import tensorflow.
Following the instruction in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33646541/tensorflow-and-anaconda-on-ubuntu, I created an environment and installed tensorflow in it, as specified in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#anaconda-installation. I use this command sudo pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL to install tensorflow. But the tensorflow is not installed in this environment. It seems that it just updates the tensorflow I have installed previously. The terminal window is shown in the image:
I have solved this problem. Use pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL instead. Using sudo will install the package globally.
