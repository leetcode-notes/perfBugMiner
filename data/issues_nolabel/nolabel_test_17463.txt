Could the periodic resample operation be accelerated?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):  No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.5.0-0-g37aa430d84', '1.5.0')
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/7.0
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080, 8 GB
Exact command to reproduce: python periodic_resample.py

Describe the problem
The periodic resample operation costs about 700ms when tansforming a tensor from 1x360x640x27 to 1x1080x1920x3. Could it be accelerated by GPU in the future or did I miss something?
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
import time

a = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1, 360, 640, 27], stddev=0.3))
b = tf.contrib.periodic_resample.periodic_resample(a, [1, 1080, 1920, None])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    tf.global_variables_initializer().run()
    start = time.time()
    _ = sess.run(b)
    print 'time: %f'%(time.time() - start)
