No attributed named 'constant'

I used the following lines of code (from tensorflow.org website)
conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.6
activate tensorflow
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow
The installation seems to be successful. However, I keep get an error saying TensorFlow has no attribute named 'constant' or 'InteractiveSessions' when I use tf.constant() or tf.InteractiveSessions(). I use a 64-bit Python version 3.6.3 and the OS is Windows 7 Enterprise.
