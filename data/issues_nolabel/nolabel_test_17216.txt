terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux3.13.0-105-generic x86_64)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (tf_nightly-1.head-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0-dev20180222
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU(Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3)
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()

Describe the problem
After I installed tensorflow which was downloaded from the main page you provided on github
tf_nightly-1.head-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
I tried to  test the tensorflow and when I run sess = tf.Session()
I got the error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'
  what():  Resource temporarily unavailable
Aborted

I use anaconda create a new python 3.6 enviroment for tensorflow. After I downloaded the .whl package I use
pip install tf_nightly-1.head-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
to install the tensorflow
I've seen a similar problem and in that case his system is CentOS. So is anyone having a similar experience with this problem?
