Tests for examples/learn

A little while ago I caught a bug with the resnet example that could have been caught by an automated test.
What do people think about bringing in some kind of automated tests to examples/skflow? What sort of tests should these be? I think the first step would be to simply run the code regularly. That would have caught the bug with the resnet example.
