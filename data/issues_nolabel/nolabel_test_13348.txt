Dataset API does not pass dimensionality information when constructing graph.  [using official ResNet]

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): YES
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OSX 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.1

Describe the problem
When I try to combine the dataset API with the resnet architecture provided at tensorflow/models/official/resnet the graph cannot be constructed because the dimension of the input data is not passed to the model constructing function.
Source code / logs
Skeleton code:
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print("initialized")

    features_placeholder = tf.placeholder(prepared_x.dtype, prepared_x.shape)
    labels_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=prepared_t.shape)

    dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features_placeholder, labels_placeholder))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.repeat(num_epoch)

    iterator = dataset.make_initializable_iterator()

    (next_x_test, next_t_test) = iterator.get_next()
    next_x_test = tf.to_float(next_x_test, name='ToFloat')


    sess.run(iterator.initializer, feed_dict={features_placeholder: prepared_x,
                                              labels_placeholder: prepared_t})


    print(next_x_test)
    print(next_t_test)

    model = resnet_v2(resnet_size=50, num_classes=num_bins)

    output = model(next_x_test,is_training=True)

The last line throws an error on compiling:

ValueError: The last dimension of the inputs to Dense should be defined. Found None.

this makes reference back to the resent_v2 definition where the final layer is a dense layer.
It appears that the dataset API is not passing dimension information hence the final dense layer does not know how to construct itself.
