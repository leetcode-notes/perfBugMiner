Broken curl URL for flower_photos.tgz

The tutorial for retraining Inception's final layer has a malformed URL, the instructions for downloading the dataset are:
cd ~
curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_../images/flower_photos.tgz
tar xzf flower_photos.tgz

The URL is broken, I think it's supposed to be:
curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
