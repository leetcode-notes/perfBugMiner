Tflite windows

Hi,
I've ported tensorflow lite to compile with msvc for my own development purposes. It was relatively easy to get it to compile with Visual Studio 2017. The main differences/issues were:
I chose to use cmake since I'm not so familiar with bazel. I'm hoping the CMakeLists.txt file can be used for other purposes than just compiling for msvc.
needed latest version of gemmlowp which is not dependent on POSIX functionality
compiler errors due to narrowing conversions double -> float due to lack of "f" suffix on float numbers in unit tests
Convolution generic optimized takes prohibitively long to compile with msvc
added an operating systems abstraction layer on top of some of the OS functions which are used such as mmap files and loading of dynamic libraries
All unit tests pass except for the ones with have the "EXPECT_DEATH" macro. The testdata filepaths in model_test.cc also need to be made cross platform.
the cmake command i used to compile with visual studio 2017 on my windows machine:
cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DMSVC_RUNTIME=static -DGTEST_LIB_DIR="C:/SDKS/googletest/lib" -DGMOCK_LIB_DIR="C:/SDKS/googletest/lib" ..\tensorflow\contrib\lite
