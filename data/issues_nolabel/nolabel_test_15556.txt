Little error in example how to read data

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee 1.3.0
Python version: 3.5.4
Exact command to reproduce:

python tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/convert_to_record.py
python tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/fully_connected_reader.py

Describe the problem
Error when doing the above second command: AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'data' The data attribute is actually in the contrib module then you should change the line 108 of the file tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/fully_connected_reader.py:
dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filename)
to
dataset = tf.contrib.data.TFRecordDataset(filename)
Sorry, I don't know if I should have submitted a pull request for such a little change.
