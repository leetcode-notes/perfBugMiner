Wrong conv2d outputs for tensors of certain sizes

System information

Custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 7 Professional, SP1
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version: tensorflow-gpu 1.3.0rc0
Python version: 3.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Titan X (Pascal), 12GB
Exact command to reproduce: conv2d

Images (tensors produced from numpy 2d arrays) of certain sizes fail to be properly convolved with conv2d function. Only the stripe on top of the image is processed correctly. The rest appears empty or contains a kind of structured noise. Sometimes it also shifted and wrapped around the image borders.
