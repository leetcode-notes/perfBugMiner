1.8.0-rc1 cherry-pick request: some fixes for boosted_trees

After the fixes:

Stopping training at the right moment, without extra layers.
BoostedTreesClassifier and BoostedTreesRegressors work well with batched Dataset now.
Dependency between resource serialization and prediction is set properly.

@annarev This is the list of cherrypicks that I wish to merge. Please let me know if I need to do anything else. Thanks!
