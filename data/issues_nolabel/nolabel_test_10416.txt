Printing TensorFlow Library Logs in Android Studio

I have built Tensor Flow using Bazel  and am using the generated TensorFlow Libraries in Android Studio
for ndk.
But I do not find the logs of Tensor Flow being printed in Android Studio.
Can I know how do I acheive this .
I have tried using Android/log.h in TensorFlow code but of no use
