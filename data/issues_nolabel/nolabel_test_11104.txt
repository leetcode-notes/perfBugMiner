Bug fixes to input function tutorial

I tried running this example today and hit a few issues. This PR fixes the issues I found:

DNNRegressor is located within tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor not tf.estimator.DNNRegressor
the method train does not exist, it's fit
returning p instead of p['predictions']

With the above fixes I was able to get the example running as expected.
