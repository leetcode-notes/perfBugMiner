add a simple tensorflow model safety-check tool

Check whether a TensorFlow model contains security sensitive ops, Output related info.
This script is designed to take a checkpoint or SavedModel model file,
and detect whether it contains security ops, and output the check result.
Traditionally, a TensorFlow model is considered as data files, this
leads people to ignore the fact that the TensorFlow model/graph
is actual program/code which contains kinds of ops and runs under the
TensorFlow runtime. Therefore, it is possibile to use legitimate ops
to do some malicious things in a model file. This script just checks
some predefined sensitive ops, do not rely on its result completely.
