Permissions error when building with bazel

Environment info
Operating System:
MacOS Sierra 10.12.3
CUDA Version 8.0.62
CUDNN version 5.1.10
Bazel Version: Build label: 0.4.5
git HEAD is c7b80d5
Seems to be a permissions issue of some sort where it can't execute?
Not sure what permissions to change so just tried to rebuild with bazel clean but I don't think that's the issue. Looked up a bunch of similar cases but they are out of date.
