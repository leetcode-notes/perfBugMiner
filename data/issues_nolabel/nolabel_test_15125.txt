Improve the Windows Bazel build

In this PR, we are making following improvements:


Remove unnecessary environment variables.
BAZEL_VS: Bazel can detect Visual C++ installation
BAZEL_PYTHON: Not needed anymore since we don't use wrapper scripts.
NO_MSVC_WRAPPER: Already using wrapper-free CROSSTOOL by default.
USE_DYNAMIC_CRT: Bazel already links to dynamic msvcrt by default.


Remove the $BUILD_OPT variable in bazel_test_lib.sh. Add these options in configure.py, this way our users don't have to remember them every time.


Remove bazel clean --expunge. With Bazel 0.8.0, I'm quite confident to remove this so that we can benefit from cache.


When --define=no_tensorflow_py_deps=true, we let py_test depend on a marker file for all dependencies of the pip package. By doing this, even without bazel clean, py_test also gets to rerun as long as the pip package changes.


Filter out external/org_tensorflow directory, when creating the pip package.
