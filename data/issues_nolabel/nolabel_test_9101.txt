Why `tf.nn.nce_loss` cannot run on GPU?

The code tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py has a comment # Ops and variables pinned to the CPU because of missing GPU implementation.  I have also found that the operation tf.nn.nce_loss cannot be implemented by GPU. So why tf.nn.nce_loss cannot run on GPU?  My guess is the log_uniform_candidate_sampler cannot run on GPU. But I still don't know which part of it cause this problem.
