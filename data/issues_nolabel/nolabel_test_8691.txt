Problems to visualize Tensorboard

Hi guys
I have problems to visualize tensorboard on my browser. ( Google chrome )
At the moment I did 3 python files.  ( 2 models and input_data )
Everything works fine, and I don't have any errors with the terminal ( Docker --> IPython ---> Terminal )
I already install pandas, urllib3, sklearn, etc etc
The terminal say me, you can sulf on Tensorboad at 0.0.0.0:6006 ( example )
I try to launch the ip on my browser but I don't see anything.
---- Step by step ---
Step 1
My file
Step 2
Terminal
Step 3
Browser
I tried with different browers, disable the firewall but nothing :(
P.s I'm noob and don't judge me for this question.
Best regards,
