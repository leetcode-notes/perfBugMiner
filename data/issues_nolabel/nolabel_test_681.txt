Building on OSX with custom swig location

Tried to compile Tensorflow on OSX where I'd installed swig (through homebrew) to a location not usually in PATH (~/homebrew/bin) and found that it failed to run swig due to an issue with the swig.sh that's checked in.
Changing the path in the swig.sh to the absolute path (rather than rely on it being globally accessible) fixed the issue, but I'm unsure how to fix properly through bazel.
Happy to submit a pull req. if someone could advise how best to fix the issue!
