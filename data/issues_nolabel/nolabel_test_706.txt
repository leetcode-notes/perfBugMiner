swig command not found

I try to build the GPU version on uBuntu 64 machine with command,
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

I installed swig and bazel successfully, but it still reports that swig not found.
src/main/tools/namespace-sandbox.c:476: arg: tensorflow/python/tensorflow.i
bazel-out/host/bin/tensorflow/swig: line 17: swig: command not found
ERROR: /userdata01/Users/wenhuchen/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl:298:3: SWIGing tensorflow/python/tensorflow.i failed: Error during execution of spawn: Process exited with status 127: Error during execution of spawn: Process exited with status 127.
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build

Can anyone help me with that?
