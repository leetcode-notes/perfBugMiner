TensorFlow 1.5.1 binaries use AVX instructions like 1.6.0 but unlike 1.5.0

System information
Linux, Python 3.6
Describe the problem
For TensorFlow 1.6.0 and later it was announced that the official binaries on PyPI will use AVX instructions and therefore it doesn't run on old GPUs. TensorFlow 1.5.0 did not need AVX instruction support. Unfortunately, the bug fix release 1.5.1 was built with AVX instructions.
The 1.5.1 binary should be rebuild without AVX instructions such that upgrading from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 is always possible.
