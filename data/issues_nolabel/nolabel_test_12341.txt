Constructor with InputStream only for TensorFlowInferenceInterface

Added a InputStream Constructor for TensorFlowInferenceInterface, which support loading model from network or many other situations that we can only have a InputStream of the model.
One thing worth mentioning is that the private modelName member is not set this new constructor, but the field is private and only use in the original constructor (which I prefer this member should be deleted), I think it should be fine.
