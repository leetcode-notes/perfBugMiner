Python 3 Builds in CI are failing

All our python 3 builds for pull requests on our CI are failing with the following error:
ERROR: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/tensorflow-pull-requests-cpu-python3/bazel-ci_build-cache/.cache/bazel/_bazel_jenkins/eab0d61a99b6696edb3d2aff87b585e8/external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/pkg/BUILD:44:1: Converting to Python 3: external/bazel_tools/tools/build_defs/pkg/build_tar.py failed: 2to3 failed: error executing command

It seems to be independent of the PR we are testing, and the error message above does not really makes sense. @damienmg , could you help us decode the above error
@benoitsteiner , who is running into this problem.
