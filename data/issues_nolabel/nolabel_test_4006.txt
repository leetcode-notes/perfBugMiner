Possible bug in tensorboard "EVENT" display?

Hi, I wanted to display the training accuracy of my model. However, I found that it could't display when I updated with tensorflow 0.10 rc version.
I checked two different situations:
Firstly, it do have values when I download the csv file, as show in below figure.

Secondly, it can display the accuracy successfully when I rollback tensorflow version to 0.9, as show in below figure.

Is that a bug in tensorflow 0.10?
