Could you please share the frozen pb which is been used in tflite example?

Hi,
In the tflite example, uses a ssd mobilenet model, I can only find the tflite model: mobilenet_ssd.tflite.
Could you please share me the frozen tf model ?
I tried http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17.tar.gz , but failed to convert it to tflite, some ops are not supported.
