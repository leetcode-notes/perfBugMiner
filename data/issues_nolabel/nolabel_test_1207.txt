Avoid copying invalid large constant data.

Tensorflow cannot create an operation with a NodeDef larger than 2GB.
(Python Unit Test Case: ConstantTest.testTooLargeConstant)
However, before throwing a meaningful exception, it consumes lots of memory
to copy the invalid input data. This causes std::bad_alloc errors sometimes.
This PR prevents those invalid copying. The allocated memory for the following
testcase decreases from over 4GB into less than 1GB.
