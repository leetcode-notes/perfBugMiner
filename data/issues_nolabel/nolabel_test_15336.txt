batch normalization layer which translated by toco cannot be run in TF Lite

Issue
Resolver for batch normalization layer(ResolveBatchNormalization) in toco has four inputs, which are input matrix, mean, multiplier, and offset respectively. Usually, input matrix has four dimensions (NHWC) while mean, multiplier, and offset only have 1 dimension for a channel. This resolver translates this 1 dimension vector to second input of Mul and Add layers in TF Lite. (first input of these layers is input matrix!) But the problem occurs Mul and Add layers in TF Lite have a process to check dimension of inputs. Need to fix this contradiction. :)
