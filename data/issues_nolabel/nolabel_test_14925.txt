Adapt identity initializer API to other initializers.

This API extension is completely backwards compatible and supports consistency.
All initializer classes (such as ZerosInitializer) have the same API and can either be accessed via the initializer namespace, from Keras initializers or directly from the tensorflow import:
>>> tf.initializers.zeros
<class 'tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops.Zeros'>
>>> tf.keras.initializers.Zeros
<class 'tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops.Zeros'>
>>> tf.zeros_initializer
<class 'tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops.Zeros'>
The IdentityInitializer class, which was added in d5f1790, had been missing the last of those options. This is why the following way of access was added to its API:
>>> tf.identity_initializer
<class 'tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops.Identity'>
