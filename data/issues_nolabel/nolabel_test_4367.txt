Strange internal error after switching from python 3 to python 2

I'm trying to port my code from python 3 to 2. However, I'm getting a strange error when running with python 2: InternalError: Unsupported feed type. This happens after trying to sess.run with a particular feed dict. What's odd is that I can run the following just fine:
for k, v in feed_dict.items():
    sess.run(k, {k:v})

That is, the individual arrays and tensors in the feed dict are all fine. I apologize for not being able to come up with a short example that reproduces the error, but perhaps someone might have some idea of what's going on?
