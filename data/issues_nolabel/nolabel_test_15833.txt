gradient function missing for odeint

I am trying to program a optimization problem using TensorFlow. The cost function depends on the outcome of an ODE solved by TensorFlow. However I find that TensorFlow's auto differential does not support the function which contains odeint.
odeint: tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/integrate/odeint
It would great be of great help if we could have it.
Have I written custom code: N/A
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: official website pip
TensorFlow version: 14.01
Bazel version: N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
