dynamic_rnn_decoder initial commit

In the raw_rnn @ebrevdo mentions that raw_rnn would be suitable to build a dynamic decoder with.
This is a dynamic decoder based on the raw_rnn as specified above.
Discussion points:

(Critical) The PR makes use of functools, is this allowed according to your standards?
(Critical) The PR makes use of contrib.layers, is this allowed according to the ops folder standards?
(Matter of taste) The PR could make use of _extract_argmax_and_embed, but the decoder_fn makes it more customizable.
(Matter of taste) The PR requires decoder inputs while validating to access the start-of-sequence symbol (could be an issue for another PR later).
