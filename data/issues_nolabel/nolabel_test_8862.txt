MSVC 2015 port.

My version of MSVC 2015 has some issues with some newer c++ constructs.
There are 3 type of fixes:

Remove optional 'typename' specifications outside template definitions.  They are optional on newer compilers, but msvc does not thinks so.
Remove brackets from initializer lists, perm({0,1}) becomes perm{0,1}. I am not sure why this is different on msvc.
Explicitly convert from Eigen::TensorMap to gtl::ArraySlice via .data() and .size().  Again, I'm not sure why this is required for msvc, but this solves the remaining compiler issues.
