CNN with complex valued filters

I was trying to implement a CNN with complex valued filters for an image processing task. Here is the gist.
I tried feeding in image with float64 dtype and I got the error Value passed to parameter 'input' has DataType complex64 not in list of allowed values: float16, float32. So, I changed the first layer to real-valued and cast that output of this layer to complex type. Then, I got the same error for the next layer, but only this time, float64 is not in the list of allowed values which has only complex types. Then I added line 31 in the gist. Now, I am getting this error saying complex128 not in the allowed values list, which now shows float types. Anyone knows how to fix this?
