add R-CNN support with ROI pooling ?

Hi,
I'm interested in implementing a R-CNN or similar object detection/recognition model. there is a theano port of Ross. Girshick's implementation in Caffe.
please let me know if there is a plan to implement R-CNN / release the ROI pooling layer in Tensorflow?
please see.
