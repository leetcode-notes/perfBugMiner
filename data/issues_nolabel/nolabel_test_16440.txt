raw_input() was removed in Python 3

raw_input() was removed in Python 3 in favor of input().  We import six so that six.moves.input() works identically in both Python 2 and Python 3.  We also add .strip() to gracefully deal with leading or trailing whitespace in the user input as well as lower() to gracefully deal with capital as well as lowercase letters.
