TFRecordReader num_records_produced() and num_work_units_completed() do not work

Hey guys, since I've been dealing a lot with TFRecord files lately, I stumbled upon the following bug:
file_queue = init_queue(dataset)

records_reader = tf.TFRecordReader(name='...')

_, record = records_reader.read(file_queue, name='...')

 #do something with record in a while loop

And when I call the two aforementioned functions they always return 0. I am sure I have used the records since I have seen the end results dumped to an excel spreadsheet.
Cheers, Kris
