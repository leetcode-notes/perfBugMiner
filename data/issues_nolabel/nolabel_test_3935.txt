Update(mnist):ps/worker cluster framework

I updated the cluster setter function of mnist_replica.py with the latest and easy-understanding way in distributed tutorial here.

worker_grpc_url -> ps_hosts / worker_hosts / server.target
2.Add the FLAGS.job_name to distinguish the ps job from worker job
