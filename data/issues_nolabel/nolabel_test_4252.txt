make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile for iOS is failing

Probably related to issue 2896
I am trying to build tensorflow on a mac for iOS. The first two commands work well:
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh
and
compile_ios_protobuf.sh
However, when I call
make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile \ TARGET=IOS \ IOS_ARCH=ARM64
I receive a linker error:

Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
"tensorflow::io::InputStreamInterface::SkipNBytes(long long)", referenced from:
vtable for tensorflow::io::ZlibInputStream in zlib_inputstream.o
"tensorflow::io::RandomAccessInputStream::RandomAccessInputStream(tensorflow::RandomAccessFile_)", referenced from:
tensorflow::io::RecordReader::RecordReader(tensorflow::RandomAccessFile_, tensorflow::io::RecordReaderOptions const&) in record_reader.o

"vtable for tensorflow::io::InputStreamInterface", referenced from:

NOTE: a missing vtable usually means the first non-inline virtual member function has no definition.

I tried it with the current master commit f71cc62f71cc62. After reading the discussion of issue 2896, I also tried it with the commit 582e6c8582e6c8. This is the one that supposedly fixed the issue in the other ticket.
