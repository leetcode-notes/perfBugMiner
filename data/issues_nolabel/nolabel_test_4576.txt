python/ops/variable_scope.py, variable_scope() is not backward compatible

3d1ee95#diff-57dece591b2185b1c01f712d53baef96L1089
It used to accept "" as name_of_scope, newer version TF will produce an error.
if default_name is None and not name_or_scope:
      raise TypeError("If default_name is None then name_or_scope is required")     

By reading the newer code, I believe disallowing "" as scope name wasn't your team's intension.
A simple fix could make this function completely backward compatible.
