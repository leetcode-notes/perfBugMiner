tensorflow based shared library can't link to other project

Problem:
I create a project in tensorflow/tensorflow/my_project. Then create a library by cc_library of bazel. I can compile it and create the library. For example, test.a, test.so in tensorflow/bazel-bin/my_project. But if I use the library in another project by linking it. It would raise a problem of finding the header file.
fatal error: tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h: No such file or directory

test.h:
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"

blabla...
