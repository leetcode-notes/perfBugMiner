Not found: Could not find session factory for DIRECT_SESSION

Operating System:  Android
because my android system is below Android 5.0, so I rebuild the tensorflow librarys for android with NDK android-11.  the building is success.
then,  with these librarys, I write a android demo.  But when I run, it output the message ...
  **Not found: Could not find session factory for DIRECT_SESSION**

I don't know, what's wrong with my works.
