Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel, you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory

These are the sequence of steps i followed to install the distributed version of TF


git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
./configure (default with GPU)
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu (at this point saw the expected output and GPU being used)
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --define=use_fast_cpp_protos=true //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.7.1-py2-none-any.whl

Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.
Can someone help me understand what might cause this? Thank you.
