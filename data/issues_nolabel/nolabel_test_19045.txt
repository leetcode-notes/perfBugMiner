Describe the problem
I am trying to use the function of tf.boolean_mask to select value from a 5D tensor. To make things easier, I just make my mask as same shape of target tensor, that is (1,12,125,179,1), but it will return zero dimension tensor as result.
Then I tried with the example tensorflow provided in official documentation. I found there's some problem with the function.
This is the document and example in tensorflow document (Since I cannot use axis argument in my environment, I think I might close to this case): https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/tf/boolean_mask
In my system, the example tensorflow documentation provided would return zero dimension tensor instead of one dimension as the example case.
Here's the example code and result:

Code
As to my case, it not so different from the example, the case just from 2D to 5D.
1 make the mask same shape with target tensor, result (none) shape tensor:

2 make the mask 1D less than target tensor, result (none, 1) shape tensor:

It's easy to reproduce with random np.array and tf.tensor.
It would be appreciated that you could spend some time to take a look at it. Thanks.
