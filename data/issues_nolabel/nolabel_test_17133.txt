Documentation for LSTMStateTuple is misleading

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): no
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5

The documentation for LSTMStateTuple states that

Stores two elements: (c, h), in that order. Where c is the hidden state and h is the output.

The property naming is very confusing. It suggests that h is the hidden state, but the documentation contradicts this intuition.
