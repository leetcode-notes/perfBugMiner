failed to install tensorflow while doing "pip install"

I am using ubuntu with GPU and follow the tutorial "Installing from sources". I successfully go through previous steps, but have trouble at the final step. After running:
"sudo bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg"
I got this:
"......
Sun Oct 23 00:22:33 CST 2016 : === Output wheel file is in: /tmp/tensorflow_pkg"
However, when I run the last step:
"sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.11.0rc1-py2-none-any.whl"
I got:
"IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.11.0rc1-py2-none-any.whl'"
I knew that the name of the .whl file will depend on your platform. But there is no folder called tmp, and I also cannot find the .whl file in my tensorflow folder.
I am a beginer, could anyone tells me how to solve it ?
