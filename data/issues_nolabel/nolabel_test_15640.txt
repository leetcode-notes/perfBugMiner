adding ps_strategy to run_config to enable different placement strate…

…gy in estimator
This is my first pull request. I noticed that there isn't any way to set the ps_strategy in tf.train.replica_device_setter if tf.estimator.Estimator is used in distributed settings. I guess the best way to notify the estimator which strategy to use is through the RunConfig class. I have added a property ps_strategy to RunConfig and filled in some of the unit tests. I have also modified the _get_replica_device_setter in estimator.py to return a device setter with the ps_strategy included. Please kindly review and let me know if there is anything I need to correct or modify
