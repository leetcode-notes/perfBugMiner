Describe the problem
I built a distributed training system with TF1.3 and it works smoothly except that it sporadically freeze. I was informed by @mrry that TF1.5 has an upgrade version of gRPC that fixes a deadlock bug that causes servers to hang.
So I tried to upgrade to 1.5 today but then a lot of unexpected problems came up and not sure if I am missing anything important for 1.5 version.
TL;DR
Soon after I launch a job, it died right away and all of the time it is the PS showing various errors like "unavailable: OS Error", "Stream removed" and "Transport closed" during sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer). Also this problem is more likely to happen if I launched more PS.
So, is there any important dependencies I have to check when upgrading from 1.3 to 1.5?
