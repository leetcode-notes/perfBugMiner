Tensorflow estimator with shared network

I am building a tensorflow model with new estimator high level api. My model looks like .
In fact, the model is more complex than that due to the model is used to simulate game operation. Classification is responsible for decide whether it is good time for action. Then the regression will give the details about the action. It contains a combination of CNN and RNN.
However, due to the complexity and memory consumption, it is impossible to train and run classification and regression as two network simultaneously. Also, when I create my estimator like:
    # Create the Estimator
    mnist_classifier = tf.estimator.Estimator(
        model_fn=cnn_model_fn, model_dir="/tmp/mnist_convnet_model")

I can only provide one model function for the estimator. Is is possibile to train and run two estimator together?
