Remove `non-fused` version of `adjust_hue` as GPU kernel is already in place

Was looking into adding batch support for tf.image.random_hue (#8926) and noticed that the non-fused version of adjust_hue was still in place. The non-fused is for non-GPU support of adjust_hue.
As GPU kernel for AdjustHue has already been added in PR #6818, I think it makes sense to remove the non-fused version. Besides, the env TF_ADJUST_HUE_FUSED seems not in use anyway.
This fix removed non-fused version of adjust_hue as GPU kernel is already in place.
