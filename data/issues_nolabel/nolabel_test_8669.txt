Input ... was not previously added to ShapeRefiner

When calling TF_GraphImportGraphDef, some graphs result in the error "Input (...) was not previously added to ShapeRefiner".
I'm still working on a MWE of a graph that causes this, but just wanted to double-check first that this does indeed indicate a bug. So far the graphs that trigger this involve back edges, although I'm not sure yet if that's necessary or sufficient.
