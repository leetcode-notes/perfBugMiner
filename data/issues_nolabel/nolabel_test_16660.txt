GPU support for Java in windows

I am working with Tensorflow in Java using the Maven dependency.
I would like to use the GPU version in my Java application but I notice there is only a supported Maven repository for Linux.
Will there be support for Tensorflow with Java in windows?
If so then what is the timeline for this?
Otherwise is there another way round it?
Thanks.
