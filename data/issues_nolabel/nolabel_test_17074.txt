Add support for Maximum to TensorFlowLite.

I don't have that many tests (e.g., not sure if broadcasting works), but running bazel test tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels:maximum_test, bazel test tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/tflite:operator_test, and bazel test //tensorflow/contrib/lite/testing:generated_examples_zip_test all passed.
To help close #14661.
