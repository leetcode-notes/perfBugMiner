Fix conv2d with kernel 1x1 stride > 1

Fixes #889 - seems the problem was an optimization to call directly into cublas when the kernel is 1x1. I suspect that was meant for 1x1 and stride 1, as it calculates the wrong thing with stride2. This adds 3 tests - two that demo the bug, one that I did while debugging but figured to submit too for extra coverage.
