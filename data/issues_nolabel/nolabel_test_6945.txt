Gradle builds for Tensorflow Android does not automatically fetch the models

Builds work fine using bazel.
However when the project is imported into android studio using gradle, the assets directory remains empty. The app crashes on startup. When the models are manually downloaded and placed into the asset folder, the gradle builds work. Not sure if this was intended.
