Mount notebooks into a mounted fs volume to avoid data loss

The current way this is done:
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm $USER/assignments

creates an ephemeral container due to the --rm flag. In the first notebook you are doing very expensive operations (gunziping) several GBs. All of this data will be lost when the container shuts down. Using the filesystem as a mounted volume, allows subsequent sessions to have access to the files created (eg pickled data). This is especially important because this is course material so want to avoid time consuming gotchas for the students.
