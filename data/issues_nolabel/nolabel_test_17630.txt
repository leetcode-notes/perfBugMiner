Fix broken link in kernel method tutorial

As we can see in Kernel Methods tutorial, the reference links in Note section haven't generated valid links.

Note: This document uses a deprecated version of ${tf.estimator}, which has a ${tf.contrib.learn.estimator$different interface}. It also uses other contrib methods whose ${$version_compat#not_covered$API may not be stable}.

This PR is a simple fix just replace the begining "$" to "@" to fix above broken links.
