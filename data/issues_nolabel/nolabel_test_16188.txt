benchmark_model tool not build successfully for android version

Hello,
I try to build the benchmark_model for the android, but I encounter some errors.
Please help, is any setting not correct?
The configuration of the SDK and NDK in the WORKSPACE is
android_sdk_repository(
name = "androidsdk",
api_level = 23,
build_tools_version = "26.0.1",
path = "/home/kk/android_sdk/android-sdk-linux",
)
android_ndk_repository(
name="androidndk",
path="/home/kk/android_sdk/ndk/android-ndk-r14",
api_level=14)
Use the command to build:
bazel build --cxxopt='--std=c++11' -c opt
--crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=armeabi-v7a --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain tensorflow/tools/benchmark:benchmark_model
There are three errors

external/gif_archive/lib/openbsd-reallocarray.c:33:19: error: use of undeclared identifier 'SIZE_MAX'
tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_debug_allocator.cc:172:53: error: no member named 'nanf' in namespace 'std'; did you mean simply 'nanf'?
external/androidndk/ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib/gcc/arm-linux-androideabi/4.9.x/../../../../arm-linux-androideabi/bin/ld: error: cannot find -lpthread

Thanks
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):use the pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4.0
Python version: Python 2.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.9.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):(Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3) 4.8.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:NA
GPU model and memory:NA
Exact command to reproduce:NA

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
