[Java] Don't strip symbols from C library when compiling in debug mode

When building the Java client with "compilation_mode=dbg", the symbols in the C++ library should not be stripped otherwise we won't be able to attach a GDB to the java process for core debugging.
Also, I thought that knowing the active compilation mode might be something useful in general so I declared the "debug" and "optimize" config settings in the parent BUILD file.
