RecordInput blocks if file_pattern returns no files.

The tensorflow.python.ops.data_flow_ops.RecordInput() blocks forever if the first input argument with keyword file_pattern is a pattern that does not point to (an) existing file(s).
It does not seem to be waiting for that file to appear either, because if I make it appear after the launch it's still blocked, leading me to believe this is a bug.
Reproduce:
sess = tf.Session()
record_input = data_flow_ops.RecordInput(file_pattern="foo")
yield_op = record_input.get_yield_op()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
sess.run(yield_op)
