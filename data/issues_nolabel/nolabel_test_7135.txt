Java: Do no strip symbols from C library when compiling in debug mode

When building the Java client, the linker should not strip symbols from the C library if we are compiling in debug mode, otherwise we won't be able to attach GDB to the java process for core debugging.
I thought that knowing the compilation mode might be something useful in general so I declared the "debug" and "optimize" config settings in the parent BUILD file.
