This is tracking bug to use Clang on Windows to build Tensorflow.
Benefits:

Faster build (Clang does not suffer from __forceinline issue in pure MSVC #10521).
Mostly compatible with MSVC (clang-cl understands MSVC command flags, macros and even imitates some of the MSVC's bugs).
Cross compilation.
Unlock some runtime optimizations such as crc32c acceleration that relies on __builtin_cpu_supports (compiler-rt is required).
Better x64 code (according to one Chromium engineer).
