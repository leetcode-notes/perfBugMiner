Cherry-pick internal change: Reduce computation load in metric_ops_test to prevent timeout

The test methods named "testWithMultipleUpdates" in test classes "StreamingAUCTest and "StreamingPrecisionRecallThresholdsTest" previously used a large number of samples (5000), which lead to repeated test timeouts in non-copt builds in TensorFlow's OSS Jenkins. For example, see:
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-matrix-cpu/TF_BUILD_CONTAINER_TYPE=CPU,TF_BUILD_IS_OPT=NO_OPT,TF_BUILD_IS_PIP=NO_PIP,TF_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON2,label=cpu-slave/111/console
Our Jenkins slaves are known to be substantially slower than the internal build machines.
This CL reduces the compute load in these two test methods. The average non-copt test time of metric_ops_test
Without this CL: ~175 s
With this CL: ~54 s
