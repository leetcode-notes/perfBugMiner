tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession does not have request_stop() method

When i use tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession class like below, I cannot use sess.request_stop() to stop the sess, because MonitoredTrainingSession does not have this method.
tensorflow version is 1.3
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(checkpoint_dir="/tmp/train_logs",
                                       config=config,
                                       hooks=hooks) as sess:
  while not mon_sess.should_stop():
      sess.run(train_op)
      sess.request_stop()
