Tensorflow android does not recognize imported networks(.pb files) with python operations

tensorflow android does not recognize operations from an imported network(.pb files) defined/created with python operations  like  recogonize tf.python.ops.FIFOQueue . Works when the network is built/defined with tf.FIFOQueue. Similarly the tensorflow android implementation cribs about unrecognized operation RECIPROCAL when running inference for a network described here
