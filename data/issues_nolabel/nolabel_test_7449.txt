bazel build --copt=-march=native not using available CPU instructions

Update 2017-12-06:
The current version of my tensorflow.sh install script has been working well for me, and the update from tf 1.3 to tf 1.4 required only a one character change!
Original Post:
Here are the key lines in my install script with a quote from the tensorflow docs:
# To be compatible with as wide a range of machines as possible, TensorFlow defaults to only using SSE4.1 SIMD instructions on x86 machines. Most modern PCs and Macs support more advanced instructions, so if you're building a binary that you'll only be running on your own machine, you can enable these by using --copt=-march=native in your bazel build command.

bazel build --copt=-march=native -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Even with --copt=-march=native I get the following warnings about the CPU instruction set, contradicting the above statement:

W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.

Here is the exact script I used to build tensorflow:
