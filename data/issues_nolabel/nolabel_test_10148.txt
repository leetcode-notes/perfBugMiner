TF tutorial getting started fix

Hi,
I am not personally having an issue, but I wanted to make you aware of some things in the tutorial that might throw off a new user.
When the tutorial starts talking about the high level functions, they define the epochs here:
input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x":x}, y, batch_size=4, num_epochs=1000)
but then they redefine here:
estimator.fit(input_fn=input_fn, steps=1000)
This seems redundant, and per earlier issues:
#10042
#7677
There were people who said this made their system glitch.  If the system did accept both arguments, then I am not clear, nor have I found anywhere in the documentation, where it says which argument would take precedence if they are different numbers.
On another note, earlier in the tutorial, it where it calculates print(sess.run(linear_model, {x:[1,2,3,4]})), for some reason there is a floating decimal point way at the end of the output:
[ 0.          0.30000001  0.60000002  0.90000004]
This doesn't add up, unless there is just some kind of extra operation that is not being shown.  I know it is likely a lot of work to handle all the issues that you get, but fixing these things might reduce your workload over time, as new users will be less confused up front, not to mention keep users from getting discourages and changing to other platforms before they begin.  Thank you for your help.
