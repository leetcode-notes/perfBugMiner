Is it possible to make IPython able to plot with matplotlib as default?

I am doing the assignment 1 of Deep learning course on Udacity. There is a problem to ask us to plot for checking the dataset.
I can not plot any figure with matplotlib initially (nothing happened). Then, looked for the solution on the internet. I found it should be with a line that will make IPython able to attach the figure:
%matplotlib notebook or %matplotlib inline
if we don't want to key the line above each time we can change the config of IPython.
Is it possible to add the line as default in this repository? I guess for novice they would be stuck a while on this point.
