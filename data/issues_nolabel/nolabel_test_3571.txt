Building tensorflow from source

Operating System: CentOS-7
CUDA: 8.0
cuDNN: 5.0
bazel: 0.3.0-2016-07-29
gcc: 4.8.5
When I try to build tensorflow from source following the instructions in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html, in particular, when executing:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
I get the following error:
ERROR: /home/fjrodriguez/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:854:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//tensorflow/core/kernels:crop_and_resize_op_gpu':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/core/kernels/crop_and_resize_op_gpu.cu.cc':
I have tried many times, the error is always similar, undeclared inclusion(s) in rule xxxx, but the xxxx is changing depending on the execution.
I've tried the solution proposed at #2413 without any luck
Thanks in advance!
