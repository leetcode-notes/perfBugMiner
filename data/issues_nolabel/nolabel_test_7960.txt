Environment info
I run tensorflow in Docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:1.0.0.
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I used tensorflow/tensorflow:1.0.0 to run examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_softmax.py. My docker run command is:
$ docker run -ti \
    -v /Users/lienhua34/Programs/python/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist:/mnist \
   tensorflow/tensorflow:1.0.0 /bin/bash
Then cd to /mnist, and run mnist_softmax.py:
root@5a17d6873afc:/notebooks# cd /mnist/
root@5a17d6873afc:/mnist# ls -l

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I followed the issue #6968 to install libtcmalloc-minimal4,
sudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal4
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4"
After that, it will run fine.
