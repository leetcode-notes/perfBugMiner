TF ignore the computation graph and output the feeding value directly.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0-rc0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
  a = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[1])
  a = tf.multiply(a, 2)
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    output = sess.run(a, feed_dict={a: [1]})
    print(output)

[ 1.]

Describe the problem
As the code above, I feed a value into the graph to do some computation. Notice that the input tensor's name is the same as the output tensor's name.
Maybe the naming is a little confusing, but I think it is used quite often.
I think it is a bug of tensorflow.
