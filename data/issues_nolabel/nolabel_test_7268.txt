C++ compilation of rule '@jemalloc//:jemalloc' failed:

Trying to install tensor flow on cluster from source. I have installed bazel
[bazel release 0.4.4- (@non-git)], and I am using python 2.7.13 with pyenv. Upon trying to build the tensorflow pip wheel I am getting a compilation error:
ERROR: ~/.cache/bazel/_bazel/e924d9c3ba75314415252c6f4f93bb86/external/jemalloc/BUILD:10:1: C++ compilation of rule '@jemalloc//:jemalloc' failed: gcc failed: error executing command /opt/apps/compilers/gcc/4.8.2/bin/gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -fstack-protector -Wall -B/opt/apps/compilers/gcc/4.8.2/bin -B/usr/bin -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object ... (remaining 38 argument(s) skipped): com.google.devtools.build.lib.shell.BadExitStatusException: Process exited with status 1.
Has anyone experienced this? Is this a consequence of the warning I get from bazel for being on an NFS:
WARNING: Output base '~/.cache/bazel/_bazel/e924d9c3ba75314415252c6f4f93bb86' is on NFS. This may lead to surprising failures and undetermined behaviour.
