Create CI build script for Raspberry Pi

This integrates the work by @ebrevdo to create a build script for the Raspberry Pi with the CI system. This script creates a Python wheel for TensorFlow on the Pi, and is a step towards creating automatic redistributable binaries for the platform.
I had to update oauth_client.cc for a missing header on this platform, and work around the eigen updating issue tracked in #9697.
