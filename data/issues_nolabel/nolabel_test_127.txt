cannot use bazel to compile tensorflow example codes

tensorflow was successfully installed on my OSX10.11 system.
using "import tensorflow" in python donot report any error, and "hello world" application can be carried out.
but when i want to run the examples(http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/index.md) in the tensorflow root directory,
i typed "bazel build -c opt tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb:ptb_word_lm"
it showed that:
ERROR: /Users/aaa/Develop/tools/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/BUILD:1: Extension file not found: 'google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl'.
ERROR: error loading package 'tensorflow/python': Extension file not found: 'google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl'.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.057s
i don't know what is wrong.
any comment is appreciated.
