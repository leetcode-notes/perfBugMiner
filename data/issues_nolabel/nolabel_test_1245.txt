tf.train.match_filenames_once incompatible with checkpointer?

On Mac 0.7.1 pip binary I'm getting the following error when trying to load a model that had called tf.train.match_filenames_once (named 'file' below) to obtain a list of file names:
InvalidArgumentError: Assign requires shapes of both tensors to match. lhs shape= [] rhs shape= [60] [[Node: geomnet/save/Assign_6 = Assign[T=DT_STRING, use_locking=true, validate_shape=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](geomnet/files, geomnet/save/restore_slice_6)]] Caused by op u'geomnet/save/Assign_6', defined at: File "/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.4.1.1975.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 162, in _run_module_as_main "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)
Is this expected behavior?
