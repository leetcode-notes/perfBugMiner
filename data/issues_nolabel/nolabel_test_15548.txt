Bug fix for example_parsing_ops_test

Delay tensor allocation.
Static variables' initialization order is not determined in C++.
In one static variable's constructor, you can't access other static variables unless they are constexpr, which is not true for tensor's allocators.
Replacing it with std::call_once.
