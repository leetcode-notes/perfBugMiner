Configure failed on NFS: Device or resource busy

On Rocks OS (CentOS 6.5) cluster, filesystem is on NFS.
When run "./configure", it failed at "ERROR: /home/shiyemin/.cache/bazel/_bazel_shiyemin/df39eb3667102dfbd2ad9a81b93b57e9/server/.nfs0000000000cdec5400000995 (Device or resource busy).". Then the configuration stoped.
I've seen this error, but never like this. I think maybe "configure" did not kill all sub-processes in time.
And i found it failed at "bazel clean --expunge".
