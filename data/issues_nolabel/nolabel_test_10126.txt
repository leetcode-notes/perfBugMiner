cudnn: Fix symlink includes handling

Following a change to symlink creation for cuda_configure.bzl, the cudnn
include path symlink would try to link to a path ending with
'includeinclude/cudnn.h' rather than the correct path, 'include/cudnn.h'.
It appears this is caused by the way _symlink_genrule_for_dir handles
particular source header files. Since the cudnn library only exports a single
include file, cuda_configure.bzl can just use _symlink_genrule_for_dir
without explicitly specifying the header files to symlink.
