How to add a new op which is similar with matmul

I want to add a new op which is similar with matmul, for example anothermatmul.

add REGISTER_OP("AnotherMatMul") to tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc like MatMul
add anothermatmul_op.h anothermatmul_op.cc to tensorflow/core/kernels/
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
then I can see  bazel-bin/tensorflow/core/libmath_ops_op_lib.lo is update, I think the new op has been compiled successfully.
install

I find util/python/python_lib/tensorflow/python/ops/gen_math_ops.py is not updated, and cannot use AnotherMatMul in python.
how to update gen_math_ops.py?
or how to generate python wrap?
