Bake TF git commit hash into TensorFlow build

Hi, is it possible to record the Git commit hash, when building from source and making it available as a variable?
Currently, there is only
tensorflow.__version__
which is nice, but with a fast-moving codebase is not quite granular enough. Something like
tensorflow.__commit__ would make each build uniquely identifiable which is important for me to produce reproducible runs.
