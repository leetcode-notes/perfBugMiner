How to include xla_op_kernel.h to the TensorFlow python package?

Have I written custom code: None
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Open MPI version: 3.0.0
TensorFlow installed from: source
Bazel version: 0.11.1
Python version: 3.5.2
GCC version: 6.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Horovod: 0.12.1
Tensorflow version: b'v1.7.0-rc1-816-g1712002ad0' 1.7.0-rc1
Exact command to reproduce: N/A
Feature request: I would like to call REGISTER_XLA_OP in Horovod and it requires that xla_op_kernel.h be included in tensorflow Python package. I wonder if it is easy to add this feature.
