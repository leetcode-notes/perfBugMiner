weird behavior on GPU ec2 - zero tensor instead of random one on local machine

GitHub issues are for bugs / installation problems / feature requests.
For general support from the community, see StackOverflow.

Steps to reproduce



import tensorflow as tf
a=tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([5], 0, 10, dtype=tf.int32, seed=10))
init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
with tf.Session() as sess:
sess.run(init)
result=sess.run(a)
print(result)
sess.close()
the result is: [0 0 0 0 0]
2. If i run it locally (on my mac laptop where tensorflow was installed via pip - i dont have a gpu), i get: [ 33689671 570442370 201367012 671088640 671145444]
3. I have python 3.5.1 , miniconda --version = "conda 4.1.5", run on EC2 , GPU K520
What have you tried?

inside miniconda, outside it..
