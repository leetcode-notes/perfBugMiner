tf.train.saver.restore failed error

Cause training a model is time consuming, So Save a Checkpoint on training, but error occurred when to restore.
The saver.restore says as follow:
Signature: saver.restore(sess, save_path)
Docstring:
Restores previously saved variables.

This method runs the ops added by the constructor for restoring variables.
It requires a session in which the graph was launched.  The variables to
restore do not have to have been initialized, as restoring is itself a way
to initialize variables.

The `save_path` argument is typically a value previously returned from a
`save()` call, or a call to `latest_checkpoint()`.

Args:
  sess: A Session to use to restore the parameters.
  save_path: Path where parameters were previously saved.

So I used it as following:
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    sess = tf.Session()
    Saver.restore(sess, "./MNIST_data/-1")

But got the following err:
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-4c62153b8108> in <module>()
     31 
     32 with tf.Graph().as_default():
---> 33     saver = tf.train.Saver()
     34     sess = tf.Session()
     35     Saver.restore(sess, "./MNIST_data/-1")
