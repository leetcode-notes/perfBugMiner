Feature request: make TensorBoard side bar resizable?

There's often a bunch of unused space on the right side of the TensorBoard interface, and if we have long directory names on the left (for example listing parameters during validation), they end up getting wrapped to multiple lines. Right now it's possible to adjust the sidebar width with Chrome's developer tools, but it seems natural for it to be resizable in the first place.
