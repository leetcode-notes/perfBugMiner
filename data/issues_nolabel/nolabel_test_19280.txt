cuda libraries cannot be found during linking

Hi All,
I am trying to build tensorflow 1.8 with bazel 0.13, gcc 4.8.5, cuda 9.0, Anaconda3 5.1.0 on Scientific LInux 7.
This is HPC environment and applications packages are installed in non-standard locations.
I set up environment so that I can use all the above software from command line.
In addition I specify path to cuda and cudnn during configuration and use --action_env.
Nevertheless, the build process fails at linking stage because it cannot find cuda libraries:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --action_env=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
...
ERROR: /home/ivy2/tmp11/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/BUILD:1473:1: Linking of
rule '//tensorflow/python:gen_io_ops_py_wrappers_cc' faile
d (Exit 1)
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libcublas.so.9.0, needed by
bazel-out/host/bin/_solib_local/_U_S_Stensorflow_Spython_Cgen_Uio_Uops_Upy_Uwrappers_U
cc___Utensorflow/libtensorflow_framework.so, not found (try using -rpath or
-rpath-link)
The reason I am building tensorflow from sources is because I got a request for C++ interface to tensorflow. My understand is that I need to build from source to get it. Is that right or is there a simpler way?
Thank you,
Igor
