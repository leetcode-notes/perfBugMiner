Enable some passes for graph_transform on Windows

Don't know why but the following passes are disabled on Windows:

quantize_weights
quantize_nodes
round_weights

This patch re-enabled them. This should fix #11351.
Regarding the original commit disabled the passes on Windows, git blame gives the commit:

Does anyone know what the commit message means?
I built it on Windows 7 x64 and ran it for my tiny MNIST model. Looks fine...
So I am abusing CI to test it.
