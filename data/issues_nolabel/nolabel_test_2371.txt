C++ API header files missing from pip install

I'm building a custom CPU/GPU operator with the pip binary install linked from
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation
Certain header files seem to be missing from the above binary. When following the Adding an Op tutorial the following is missing

tensorflow/core/framework/register_types.h

but also header files for things like the GPU Stream Executor, Temp and Scratch Allocators which appear to be used by the inbuilt tensorflow ops
Is the omission of these header files intentional and if so can we trying using the headers from a source distribution? Adding an Op suggests that either a source or binary distribution is suitable for building a custom GPU operator.
