Fix shape validation error with tf.nn.conv3d_transpose

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #18460. In tf.nn.conv3d_transpose when list or np array is passed, the validate of the output shape with filter shape uses output_shape[4] (channel). This will not work with data_format='NCDHW'.
This fix fixes the issue by replace output_shape[4] with output_shape[axis].
This fix also adds a test case. Before this fix, the test case will fail.
This fix fixes #18460.
