CMake: optionally link to ZLIB as systemlib / shared objects.

If the user has ZLIB (and devel pkg) installed at the system
and the user wants to keep using that ZLIB for tensorflow,
the cmake option "-Dsystemlib_ZLIB=ON" will allow to do so.
Another option "-Dsystemlib_ALL=ON" will turn on every
"systemlib_*" options.
This requires PR #15381 because this exposes the need for -fPIC from png.
This PR is an implementation suggestion to the proposal #13061
