Does  custom Op run slower than inner Op?

l want to incorporate an operation that isn't covered by the existing library, so I create a custom Op.
Howerver it run slowly. Does  custom Op run slower than inner Op? I have test on it by adding an new Op to do the same thing as matmul Op, the result is that the new op run slower than the exist matmul Op.
