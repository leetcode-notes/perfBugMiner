Empty tensorflow/python/tools directory after build tf 1.5 from source

I rebuild Tensorflow-GPU Version 1.5.0rc0 from source with Bazel Version 0.9.0 with CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7 to see changes from my previous version 1.4 also build from source with same prerequesites.
But now the tensorflow/python/tools directory is empty? Has anybody experienced the same?
Or Did these scripts get moved to another directory?
