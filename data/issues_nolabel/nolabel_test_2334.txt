Immediate-mode execution in TensorFlow

Mirror TensorFlow API to provide "numpy/Torch"-like mode for executing TensorFlow programs.
Briefly, provide a mode where you can do the following:
a = tf.constant([[1,1],[1,1]])   # constant is created
b = tf.constant([[2,2],[2,2]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)  # executes matrix multiplication
print c                      # transfers contents of c from TensorFlow runtime to Python runtime and prints it


Goals

No separation between graph-construction and evaluation - each op is executed in TensorFlow runtime the moment the corresponding wrapper is evaluated by Python
Reuse of TensorFlow Graph for efficiency. For instance, after float32 addition was performed once, any additional float32 addition operations should be done by reusing previously created OpDef
Immediate-style Tensor object implements functions in 3.4.8. Emulating numeric types and translates them to appropriate TensorFlow operations
Immediate-style Tensor object keep contents of underlying tensors in TensorFlow runtime and only transfers them to Python when necessary, such when needed for flow control and printing.
