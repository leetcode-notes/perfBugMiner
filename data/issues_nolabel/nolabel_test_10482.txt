Support channel groups in convolutional layers

This PR implements the channel groups in convolutional layers (Conv1D, Conv2D, Conv3D, Conv2DTransposed).
The grouped convolution was firstly implemented in AlexNet as a way to share filter parameters across feature maps. A detailed discussion on this feature can be found on here. This feature is supported by Caffe (doc) and used in its reference caffenet. Adding this feature to TensorFlow makes it easier to compare models on two different frameworks and migrate from Caffe to TensorFlow.
