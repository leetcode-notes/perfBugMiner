tensorboard visualize embedding error

env: tensorflow v. 0.12.0 RC0
Following the instructions, I use tensorboard to visualize embeddings (without any metadata) and comes the following error:

File "/home/morphe/miniconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/plugins/projector/plugin.py", line 139, in configs
run_path_pairs.append(('.', self.logdir))
AttributeError: 'dict_items' object has no attribute 'append'

It seems to work if I attempt to change tensorflow/tensorboard/plugins/projector/plugin.py:
- run_path_pairs.append(('.', self.logdir))
+ run_path_pairs = [('.', self.logdir)]

Not sure if this is the right way to go. Is this a bug?
