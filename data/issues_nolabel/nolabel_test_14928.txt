Variable size multi-label candidate sampling.

A fix that adresses the following issue #12968.
Makes candidate sampling ops accept a tensor instead of an int per batch as a num_true parameter. Interface change (switching the .attr to .input). I left out one check in ComputeAccidentalHits - .SetShapeFn(), and would be open to any suggestion on how to fix that.
