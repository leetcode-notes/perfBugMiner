[Feature request] To add the ability to use own data during the training a RNN network for translation by the translate.py script

Right now the script translate.py does not allow to use own data for training. At the moment it works only with the data, that the script downloads from the Internet (en/fr). Also there is not any documentation on the format of the input data that it expects in the input. In order to have the ability to train the model with own data 2 changes need to be made to the script:

to document the format of the input data;
enable the ability to pass an own input file path via the script arguments, the file path should be used for training instead of downloading the data from the internet.
