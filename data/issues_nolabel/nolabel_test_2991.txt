Error running tf.nn.atrous_conv2d on TF 0.9.0rc0

Getting error running tf.nn.atrous_conv2d on TensorFlow 0.9.0rc0. The same code runs successfully on TensorFlow 0.8.0 installed from the source.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:  None
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.9.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
0.9.0rc0

Steps to reproduce

Install TF from the package
Call tf.nn.atrous_conv2d from the client code (see code here - https://github.com/nmayorov/ufcnn/blob/master/ufcnn/ufcnn.py)
Get TypeError: int returned non-int (type NoneType)

What have you tried?

Installation of 0.8.0 from the source helps
