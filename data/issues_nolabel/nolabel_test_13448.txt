Building for tensorflow.dll failed because architectures < sm35 are not supported

Hi,
I am trying to compile the dynamic library tensorflow.dll with cmake for windows 10 and GPU enabled. However, the library tf_core_gpu_kernels failed because of the following error:
"Unable to compile CudaAtomicAdd for complex64  architectures < sm35 are not supported"
I am building for a device with a card graphic Gforce 1080Ti (compute 61). So my configuration in Visual Studio is:
Cuda C/C++-> Device -> Code generation: compute_61, sm_61. But, I am still having the error.
Is it related with any other configuration?. It would be great if someone could help with this issue.
Thanks in advance.
