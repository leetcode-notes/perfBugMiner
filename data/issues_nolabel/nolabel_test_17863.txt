Support a single Tensor in StagingArea.put()

This PR is to fix #13288 as a follow-up of #17862 to support a single Tensor in StagingArea.put().
As described in the above issue, considering the following two pieces of codes:
Snippet 1

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import staging
staging.StagingArea(dtypes=[tf.int32]).put(tf.constant(1))

Snippet 2

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import staging
staging.StagingArea(dtypes=[tf.int32]).put((tf.constant(1),))

The Snippet 1 won't work while the Snippet 2 works. It obviously currently can only support a tuple or a list of tensors instead of single tensor.
