Cannot reload tensorflow with importlib

System information

I just tried reloading tensorflow using importlib

Describe the problem
I won't really call it a problem. I was just trying to explore some part of tensorflow by checking out some stuffs. I just thought of reloading the module but it won't work. I don't know if this is something that should work or it's just a side effect of how tensorflow is implemented. Just adding it in in case it's something that should work.
