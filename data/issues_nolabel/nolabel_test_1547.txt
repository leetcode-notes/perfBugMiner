549 unsorted segment max

Gave it a try, however, computation of the theoretical jacobian seems to fail in the test.
All manual tests seem fine, and the numerical jacobian comparison between the sortedMax and unsortedMax seem also fine.
Any idea why this is, I am not super familiar with automatic derivatives, or is that not applicable for the max operation?
