How to use tensorflow python API from the source tree?

I am trying to setup an efficient development environment for new code inside tensorflow source tree and an external library. Therefore, I am trying to avoid the pip installation process (after every code change) and use the output of bazel build directly in the source tree. In particular, I need access to the Python API from the external library. Can that be accomplished?
