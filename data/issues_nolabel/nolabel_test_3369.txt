AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'constant'

Hi everyone, I tried to run Tensorflow 0.9.0 with Python 3.4 but I've received this error:
Python 3.4.5 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:47:57)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 4.2 (clang-425.0.28)] on darwin

import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'constant'
Steps to reproduce

Installed Anaconda 64-bit Python 3.5
Installed Tensorflow following these instructions

What have you tried?
Tried with Python 3.5 but no luck as well. Version 2.7 works fine but I need to use version 3.x as part of my coursework requirement.
