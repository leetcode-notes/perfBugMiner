How to implement Multiplexer

How to takes a single input and select one of many output lines, which is connected to the input, by using placeholder?
For example if we have a TF variable as follow, how could we forward it to the 1st output ?
intputs = tf.constant(0.2, shape=[2, 2])
sel = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
n_out = 3
out = xxxx(sel, inputs, n_out)  # here

sess.run(out, feed_dict = {sel: 0}) 
# [[[0.2, 0.2],[0.2, 0.2]], 
   [[0, 0],[0, 0]], 
    [[0, 0],[0, 0]]]
