Unable to build Tensorflow Benchmark model for Android

I've been trying to benchmark the model on mobile but I'm not able to build the model for Android. For desktop, I have been able to build and run the benchmark model.
The machine I'm using is a MacBook pro 15 inch with High Sierra and tensorflow v.1.4
I've been following the directions given at the following links:
(https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/optimizing#how_to_profile_your_model
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.4/tensorflow/tools/benchmark)
Edit: Updated answer to the issue template
Have I written custom code

No custom code was written
