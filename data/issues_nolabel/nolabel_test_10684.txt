Allow `1/0` to be compatible with tf.bool

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #5407 where
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.python.ops import math_ops
import tensorflow as tf

label = tf.constant(np.array([1, 0, 1]), dtype=tf.bool)
math_ops.equal(label, 1)

will raise an exception of type mismatch.
This fix updated the _AssertCompatible so that 1/0
is compatible with tf.bool types.
Additional test cases have been added.
This fix fixes #5407
