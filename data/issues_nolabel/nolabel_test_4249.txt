Inception-v3 checkpoint - Tensor name not found

Trying to run the Inceptionv3 Tensorflow model with the architecture and the checkpoint provided by Google here.
The issue is that tensorflow crashes on saver.restore(sess, "./inception_v3.ckpt") with the following error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.NotFoundError: Tensor name "InceptionV3/Mixed_5b/Branch_1/Conv2d_0b_5x5/biases" not found in checkpoint files ./inception_v3.ckpt
I get the same errors with the inception resnet v2 checkpoint/model combination.
Missing tensor in the checkpoint or issue with the model file?
Thank you
