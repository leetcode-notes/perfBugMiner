Tensorflow distributed RNN crashed on ProtoBuf when using 3*512 rnn.

Environment info
Operating System:
Linux XNLPEXP2 4.4.0-24-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 8 19:27:37 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Azure VM 8 cores, 56GB memory
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
pip 8.1.2 from /home/xubixiong/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
0.10.0rc0
Steps to reproduce

Create 2_PS + 2_worker,
Try 3 * 512 RNN, (I changed some code in rnn/translate to make it distributed), worker0 will 100% crash on some code related to TensorBuf and run global_step, the stack is at the end of this post, same everytime
Smaller the RNN, make it 1*128, it works fine.

What have you tried?

tensorflow.python.framework.errors.UnavailableError is said to not used in the document.
The crashing line is TensorBuffer* buf = tensorflow::TensorCApi::Buffer(src); in tensorflow/core/client/tensor_c_api.cc:
I try to smaller the RNN size and layers, then there is no problem.
Is it a known issue, I did find some issue relating to TensorBuf, but not the exactly same case.

Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
