Ensure Java Session closes the JNI on finalize

Currently the JNI Session object does not close
the native library when the JVM deallocates
This ensures that when the JVM deallocates this
object from the system it also closes the native
code correctly

Obviously the user should call close explicitly or use try blocks, but this catches the cases where they don't and can prevent massive memory leaks on services.
