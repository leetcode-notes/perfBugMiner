Problem with meta file size when saving model initialized with pre-trained weights

Context/Problem
I have pretrained models (from elsewhere) with weights saved as numpy arrays. I want to create a tensorflow model where the weights and biases are initialized with numpy arrays rather than random tensors. I am able to do this (code snippet below), but run into problems when I try saving/loading my model.
Specifically, the problem involves using the Saver class to save model and model.meta. I expect model.meta to be much smaller in size than model, but this is not the case. In fact, using the code snippet below, you can see that the meta file is the same size as the model file.
This results in problems when importing the meta file with much larger models.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubunutu 14.04
Tensorflow version: '0.9.0rc0'
Steps to reproduce
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# normally pretrained weights, but random arrays used for brevity
weights = np.random.rand(1000, 500).astype(np.float32)
biases = np.random.rand(500).astype(np.float32)

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1000], name='input')

W = tf.Variable(weights)
b = tf.Variable(biases)

fc = tf.matmul(x, W, name='fc1')
fc = tf.nn.bias_add(fc, b)
y_pred = tf.nn.softmax(fc, name='output')

# saving model
sess = tf.Session()
init_op = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess.run(init_op)
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.save(sess, "model")
