Empty input to conv2d causes floating point exception

When empty data is passed into conv2d, the following is displayed, and the program quits:
Floating point exception (core dumped)

This problem occurs on both Mac (10.9) and Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) in CPU mode (I haven't tried GPU). Here is code that reproduces the problem.
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1])
conv1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([5, 5, 1, 32], stddev=0.1))
conv = tf.nn.conv2d(x, conv1_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    tf.initialize_all_variables().run()
    sess.run([conv], {x: np.empty((0, 28, 28, 1))})
