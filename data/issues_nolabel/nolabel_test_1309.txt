Fixing basic Ubuntu CMake Build

PR #728 added basic CMake support for Tensorflow. However, that PR was only tested on MacOSX, so had a few errors on Ubuntu. This PR adds in fixes to make basic model compile on Ubuntu 12.04, with gcc 4.9.2, glibc 2.15.
The compile model does not yet run to completion (segfaults). I hope to debug that issue in a follow-on PR.
