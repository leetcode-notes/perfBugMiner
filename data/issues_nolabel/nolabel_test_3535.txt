SGD only? What about other algorithms like L-BFGS?

This is simply a question, not an issue, as this seemed like the best place to ask:
I was looking at the video an model on the site, and it appeared to only have SGD as an algorithm for machine learning.  I was wondering if other algorithms are also included in tensorflow.
