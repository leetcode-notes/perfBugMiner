Can't quantize nodes In while

I have similar errors with #7162 when quantize_nodes for Tensor2Tensor Transformer model.
It's no problem after freeze_graph, it's also no problem with quantize_weights. But when I qutize_nodes, it will:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: The node 'transformer/while/body/parallel_0/body/decoder/layer_prepostprocess/layer_norm/add_1/eightbit' has inputs from different frames. The input 'transformer/while/body/parallel_0/body/decoder/layer_prepostprocess/layer_norm/add_1_eightbit/transformer/while/body/parallel_0/body/decoder/layer_prepostprocess/layer_norm/add_1/Enter/quantize' is in frame 'transformer/while/while_context'. The input 'transformer/while/body/parallel_0/body/decoder/layer_prepostprocess/layer_norm/mul_1/eightbit/requantize' is in frame ''.

I have tried TF1.4 and TF1.7, and the error is the same.
Can anyone help me?
