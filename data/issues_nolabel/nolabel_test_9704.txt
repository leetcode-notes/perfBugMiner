Making sure GLSTMCell is visible through tf.contrib.rnn.GLSTMCell

This is a followup to #9606. Just adding it to

contrib/rnn/__init__.py.

One question, though. Am I supposed  to add something to:

/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py

If yes, what exactly? The challenge here is that GLSTM has different number of variables/groups - hence number of "kernels" is determined at runtime.
