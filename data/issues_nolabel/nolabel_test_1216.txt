Android demo fails to build due to protobuf visibility error

When running the instructions to build the Android demo with the latest open-source repo, a protobuf visibility error causes the build to fail.
Steps to reproduce:

On an Ubuntu system, git clone the repo following the install instructions.
Run bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo.

Results:
ERROR: /usr/local/google/home/petewarden/projects/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:77:1: Target '//google/protobuf:cc_wkt_protos' is not visible from target '//tensorflow/core:protos_all_cc'. Check the visibility declaration of the former target if you think the dependency is legitimate.

Notes:
I think this might be a protobuf Bazel rule problem. I was able to fix it by patching google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl like so:
