seq2seq multidimensional regression

Hi, I am facing an issue while trying to train an RNN to do a multidimensional regression.
The Tensorflow loss function built for RNNs seems to address the cases where we directly want to train labels or words embeddings, so I tried to compute the loss myself for a regression and it failed or seems not done for that.
The question is also more detailed with my actual code and Tensorflow Graph on StackOverflow.
This seems more like a missing feature, so this is why I ask the question here too.
What would be a nice workaround? There should be one.
If there is already code for that, I would really like to see it, because what I want to do seems undocumented yet and I would like to do it, I am probably not alone. In the end, I would like to predict the N next coeficients of some STFT, but for now I focus on making the regression model with simple sinusoidal data.
Many thanks!!!
