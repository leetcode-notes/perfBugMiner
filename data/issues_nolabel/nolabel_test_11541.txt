tfcompile won't work with graph that has no inputs

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.1 (git version v1.2.0-2140-g85d4102)
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 5.1.5
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 970 4GB

Describe the problem
I have been working on a char-rnn like network that is trained on a corpus of text, and then produces similar text as output. I'm trying to compile the graph, but tfcompile asserts that the list of feeds is non-empty. However, since for my network there are no inputs to specify as feeds, tfcompile fails.
Source code / logs
The configuration I tried to use looks like this:
fetch {
  id { node_name: "predictions" }
}

The error message:
INVALID ARGUMENTS: feeds and fetches must be specified

which comes from 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/aot/tfcompile_util.cc
    
    
         Line 119
      in

           return errors::InvalidArgument("feeds and fetches must be specified"); 
        
    
  


I don't really know anything about how the compiler works, but is this check in place because it was assumed that you'd always want to have an input, or because of some other limitation that would cause the compilation to fail with no feeds?
