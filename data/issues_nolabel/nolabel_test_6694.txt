Why cannot I import the tpprof module?

From this line I get to know that the new added profile tool is imported, but it seems strange: 1) it cannot be imported from the interactive interface; 2) and when mnist is run it raise the same error saying ImportError: cannot import name 'tfprof_log_pb2'. What happened for the newly added feature?
