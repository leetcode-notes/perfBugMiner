AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.seq2seq' has no attribute 'BeamSearchDecoder'

I don't know why I am getting this issue:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.seq2seq' has no attribute 'BeamSearchDecoder'

I am using version 1.1.0, and BeamSearchDecoder is in the API master for Python: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BeamSearchDecoder
