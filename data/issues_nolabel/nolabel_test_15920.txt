cmake CUDA include-path whitespaces not supported

I'm not sure if this is intentional, but I just had some trouble with compiling tf_core_gpu_kernels due to a invalid include-dir path as command line argument given to nvcc (caused by a whitespace in the path).
In windows I was able to solve this by adding double quotes at line 277 in CMakeLists.txt:
set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS};--include-path \"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/$\{build_configuration\}\";--expt-relaxed-constexpr)
Possible errors when not using double quotes:
nvcc fatal : A single input file is required for a non-link phase when an outputfile is specified
Also note that there will be problems because of CUDA not supporting some versions of msvc.
The current version for example is not yet supported.
CUDA_HOST_COMPILER path is automatically set to $(VCInstallDir)/bin, what will cause problems on some systems. For VS2015 this works fine but not for VS2017 if you are using the recent compiler.
There are also several errors when using the intel compiler, as for example the typename TType<...> declarations, which are not really required. Either remove the typename keyword or use 'auto'.
Other than that the master branch is compilable with ICC 18.
