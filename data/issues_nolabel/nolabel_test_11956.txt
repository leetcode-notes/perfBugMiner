Feature Request: Correlation Layer

There is a surging interest in Geometric Computer Vision and a large number of recent papers leveraging an operation(with small variations) dubbed "Correlation" layer. There is a CUDA kernel for this operation in the FlowNet paper's author's fork of Caffe. Is there plan on including it in Tensorflow? I couldn't locate a relevant issue anywhere and this is why I am raising this issue.
