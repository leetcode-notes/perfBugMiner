keras multi_gpu_model broken going from 1.6.0-rc0 to 1.6.0-rc1

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version: 1.6.0-rc1
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version: 0.10
GCC/Compiler version: 6.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.1 cuDNN 7.0.5
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA Titan Z 12GB
Exact command to reproduce: multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)
Just upgraded from rc0 to rc1 of release 1.6.0 and I'm now getting the following crash when running the multi_gpu_model function (was working fine with rc0):
parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)

File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/utils/training_utils.py", line 207, in multi_gpu_model
return Model(model.inputs, merged)

if layer.is_placeholder:

AttributeError: 'Lambda' object has no attribute 'is_placeholder'
I rolled back to the 1.5 branch and I'm not having any issues running multi_gpu_model there.
