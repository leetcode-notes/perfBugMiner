[Building Error] clang: error: no such file or directory: 'x86_64'

Hi all,
I met this problem when I was trying to build the Tensorflow Lite for iOS following this instruction.
Every thing went well until I tried the command:
tensorflow/contrib/lite/build_ios_universal_lib.sh
The error occured:
clang: error: no such file or directory: 'x86_64'
What could be the problem? Thank you very much!
My environment: Mac Sierra 10.12.6, XCode 9.2
