python_configure.bzl: Add python import library on Windows

When building a Python C/C++ extension on Windows, we need to link to the python import library pythonXY.lib (eg. C:\Program Files\Anaconda3\libs\python35.lib)
See https://docs.python.org/3/extending/windows.html
Previously, TensorFlow relies on Bazel adding the python lib path C:\Program Files\Anaconda3\libs into LIB environment variable, the build will break after Bazel stop doing so.
To solve this problem, we generate a python_import_lib rule. Ideally, it should be a cc_library, but when building a dll, Bazel add /WHOLEARCHIVE to python35.lib because it cannot tell it's a static library or import library(they have the same extension .lib). This will cause a linking error. As a workaround, we put it into linkopts if python_headers.
