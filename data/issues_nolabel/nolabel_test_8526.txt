"Feed" cannot run in Windows

Environment:
Windows 10
CPU: i7 6700HQ
GPU: 960M
Driver: 368.71
CUDA: 8.0
CUDNN: 5
Python 3.5.2
TensorFlow-GPU 1.0.1
When I try to run this
import tensorflow as tf

input1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
output = tf.add(input1, input2)  

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run([output], feed_dict={input1:32.2, input2:13.35}))
My program will crash and show that Python has stopped working.
This is trace:

But, if change test.py as this
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
        input1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
        input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
        output = tf.add(input1, input2)  
        print(sess.run([output], feed_dict={input1:32.2, input2:13.35}))
It will OK
