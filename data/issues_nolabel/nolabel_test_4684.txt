Fix skflow resnet example to work on v0.10.0

I tried to run resnet.py skflow example on TensorFlow v0.10.0,
but an error occurred.
I have fixed the code to run on v0.10.0:

tensorflow.contrib.learn.ops.conv2d was deprecated and has been removed in #4373 .
So changed to use contrib.layers.convolution2d .
classifier wasn't created if no previous model existed in models/resnet/graph.pbtxt,
but it was failed to run at first time.
TensorFlowEstimator creation was removed in #2863 , so revert the code removal.
