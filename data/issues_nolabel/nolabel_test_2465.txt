Multidimennsionnal input for LSTM Issues

I have a series of multdimensionnal time series as follow:
Input Xi   i=1..N samples
Xi=[y1,..yk..., yT] K=1..T , yk is a vector, T= 50 (sequence length) with yk= [yk1, ... ykm] m=3 with ykj : Float or Int
Using LSTM Tensor Flow,would like to predict the next step (T+1), given the training of samples like :
Xi=[y1,...., yT]`
The current code gives input form for m=1 (unidimensionnal Y),
input_data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [batchSize, numSteps, numInputs])
targets = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [batchSize, numSteps, numInputs])
Wondering if there is a way to input data if m=2, 3 in the LSTM tensor flow ?
If not, is there a workaround to input multdimensionnal time series ?
Or new devs needs to be done in RNN ?
