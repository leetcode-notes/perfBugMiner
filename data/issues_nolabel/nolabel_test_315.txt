Use CFFI for interfacing C functions.

CFFI  is a big step towards standard practices for making and distributing Python packages with C extension modules.
With CFFI the maintenance is much easier, and the code is still fast.
There are lot of benefits:

Abstract the Python version (CPython2, CPython3, PyPy).
Better control over when and why the C compilation occurs, and more standard ways to write distutils- or setuptools-based setup.py files.
Keep all the Python-related logic in Python so that you donâ€™t need to write much C code.

I'm really looking forward to use PyPy with tensorflow.
