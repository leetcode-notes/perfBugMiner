tf.contrib.framework.sort failing with <<...has no attribute 'sort'>> in TF windows

[Problem] : Can't use tf.contrib.framework.sort in my tensorflow code as it's failing to find the 'sort' attribute
Source code:
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(10, 10))
y = tf.contrib.framework.sort(x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    rand_array = np.random.rand(10, 10)
    print(sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: rand_array})) 

Error log:
 <module>
    y = tf.contrib.framework.sort(x)
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.framework' has no attribute 'sort'
