Added an "UpdateInput" method to the Python C API

This is the only current limitation I see for allowing the implementation of gradients through the C API for while loops. @skye this relates to our discussion in #10089 and could provide a temporary solution until we have a more elegant solution. Since it is in the python_api.h interface, similar to AddControlInput, I hope accepting this doesn't cause any issues.
