RNN: tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: indices[15,0] = 10535 is not in [0, 10000)

Hey. I adapted the example file (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb/ptb_word_lm.py) to work on my training data. Unfortunately as soon as the training data exceeds a certain size I'm getting an error: http://pastebin.com/JkV7MCQk What could be the issue? How can I debug this?
Might it be an issue with the training data? (http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=02347215266721316111)
