Bazel build Android shared object libtensorflow_demo.so fails with jni.h not found

I'm trying to build a .so of the Tensorflow Android lib in order to include in the build process of an existing app. Bazel is able to build the full apk fine, but it's having trouble when I tell it to only build the .so, complaining that jni.h is not found.
