Add gzip and zlib support for FixedLengthRecordReader

This fix adds gzip and zlib support for FixedLengthRecordReader,
as was discussed in #8865.
When FixedLengthRecordReader is used, it will check for
compression_type flag and use ZlibInputStream as needed.
The usage of InputBuffer in FixedLengthRecordReader has
also been changed to BufferedInputStream to match ZlibInputStream.
This fix fixes #8865.
