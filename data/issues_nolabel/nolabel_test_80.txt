tensorboard gulp - analytics.js missing

installing frontend dependencies works fine from a clean ubuntu install:
npm install
bower install
tsd install
compiling all deps with gulp vulcanize throws an error however:
[~/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorboard]$ gulp vulcanize

not a huge problem as the frontend works just fine with gulp server
