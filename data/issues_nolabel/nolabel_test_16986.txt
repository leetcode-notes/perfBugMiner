ParseSingleExample op is missing from op_def_registry.get_registered_ops()

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
ParseSingleSample is available as tf.parse_single_example() method call, but it is not listed in the op_def_registry.get_registered_ops()
Which cause freeze_graph.py call to fail with following error:
ValueError: No op named ParseSingleExample in defined operations.
