I need to implement a network with locally connected layers (convolution without weight sharing) with 2D inputs (images).
I was wondering if the implementation of this feature is on the roadmap or if there exists some clever hacks using existing TF functions to do it.
EDIT: It seems this kind of layer is often used for face classification for instance in DeepFace.
