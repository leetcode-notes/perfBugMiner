Add RecordInput documentation to tf.contrib.framework

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #10622 where the RecordInput is not available in the documentation.
As was suggested in #10622, this fix exposes RecordInput to tf.contrib (tf.contrib.framework) so that docs could shown up.
After this change and run with:
bazel run tools/docs:generate --
           --src_dir="$(pwd)/docs_src/"
           --output_dir=/tmp/tfdocs/

The documentation correctly shown up in:
/tmp/tfdocs/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/framework/RecordInput.md
This fix fixes #10622.
