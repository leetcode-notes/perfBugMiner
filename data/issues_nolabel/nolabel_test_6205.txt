Adding fast layer normalization GPU kernels and layer functions to tf.contrib.layers

from issue #6146
Instead of putting the code into a new directory under contrib, I took some time and merge them into contrib/layers, because I thought it fits quite nicely there.
Due to my rudimentary knowledge of Bazel's build rules, I couldn't figure out a way to put the kernel codes in the kernels folder, since there's a  BUILD file in the folder already, it outputs crosses boundary of subpackage error during ./configure if I reference kernel codes from contrib/layers/BUILD. As the result, I put them into ln_kernels folder as a temporary hacky measure.
