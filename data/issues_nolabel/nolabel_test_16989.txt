Fix a bug in tf.strided_slice()

Current implementation modifies TfLiteNode::builtin_data every time when a loaded graph is executed. The three masks in params (please see the patch) will continually flipping, and causing the op produce incorrect result every two executions.
The bug can be reproduced by m.Invoke() twice in most axis-shrinking unit tests from strided_slice_test.cc. I am not sure if I should add one extra m.Invoke() as it will really look like typo.
