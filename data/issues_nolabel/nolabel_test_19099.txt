Add clcache to CMake CI build

Locally, my GPU build seems to run about 20 mins faster using clcache. I'm curious whether you see a difference in the runtime of the CI build.
This change installs clcache each build, which is a little silly, but should be enough to see if the build time changes. If it does, maybe we can just install ahead of time or add a check to see if already installed.
