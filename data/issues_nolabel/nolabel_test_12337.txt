[XLA] Bring XLA Transpose021Tiled up-to-date with reference CUDA implementation.

The Transpose021Tiled is no longer up-to-date with the reference Cuda implementation and this PR updates the XLA to generate codes that resemble the latest reference Cuda implementation. The main improvement is that a two dimensional logical thread block is launched instead of a one dimensional one. Having more threads in a block increases throughput of transpose.
