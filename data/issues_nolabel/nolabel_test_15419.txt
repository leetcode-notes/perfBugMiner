official MNIST example should avoid huge constants

Right now MNIST model loads dataset as a huge MNIST constant
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/mnist/mnist.py#L65
This makes graphdef > 1 GB in size. That causes slowness when trying to visualize graph/dump graphdef. It should instead avoid constant. IE, you can load dataset into tf.Variable
