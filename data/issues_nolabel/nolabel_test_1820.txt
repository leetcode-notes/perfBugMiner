Tensorflow version of word2vec issue with huge corpora

Hi All,
I have the pip wheel distribution of Tensorflow r7.1 in Red Hat 6 in our cluster.
My issue is that I wanted to extract the embedding from a huge corpora (5*10‚Åπ tokens), but  the 32 bit "corpus_size_" counter in "word2vec_kernel.cc" is not enough. It seems that it is not so straightforward to fix it (changing the counter to int64).
I have seen that this very error was reported last  17th of Dec 2015 in issue #531.
I also receive the following error:
W tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec_kernels.cc:59] Invalid argument: The text file wbu.txt contains too little data: -522037214 words
