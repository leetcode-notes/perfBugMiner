Optimizing over only some parameters

Currently the optimizers in TensorFlow appear to act simultaneously upon all tf.Variables in the function graph. However, commonly, it's useful to optimize only over certain Variables. For example, given a pre-trained network, I might only want to optimize wrt a new set of output weights. Am I misreading the examples and optimizer code or is this presently not supported?
