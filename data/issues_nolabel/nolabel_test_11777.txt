No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Ceil' on Android

I'm running tensorflow on android. And it reports a exception of one of my op 'Ceil'. The exception info is as below:
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Ceil' with these attrs. Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels: <no registered kernels> [[Node: model/frame/Ceil = Ceil[T=DT_DOUBLE](model/frame/truediv)]] at org.tensorflow.Session.run(Native Method)
I believe Ceil is a basic op and it should has CPU implement. So maybe I miss sth. ?   ( I clone tensorflow master branch and build the lib and java interface on that)
