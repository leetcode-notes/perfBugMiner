1:1 between internal and external commits

Currently, it seems that the internal commits to TensorFlow are generally exported to the GitHub repository in batches.
We have some infrastructure set up for bazelbuild/bazel for both importing external patches into the internal repository and pushing internal commits to the GitHub repository, scrubbing any sensitive information from commit messages. Perhaps we can sync offline to see if we can use the tools for TensorFlow and then rewrite the Git history, especially given #294.
