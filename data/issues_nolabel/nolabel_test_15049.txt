No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'OneHot' with these attrs. Tensorflow1.4

I have trained and saved a CNN model in python Tensorflow 1.3.
I can successfully load and run the graph previously saved from my python model in Tensorflow 1.4 using CPU and c++ with no problem; but when I tried to load the same graph using Tensorflow 1.4 using GPU c++ and I get the following error:
- status {state_=unique_ptr {code=INVALID_ARGUMENT (3) msg="No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'OneHot' with these attrs. Registered devices: [CPU,GPU], Registered kernels:\n <no registered kernels>\n\n\t [[Node: one_hot = OneHot[T=DT_FLOAT, TI=DT_INT32, _... } } tensorflow::Status
