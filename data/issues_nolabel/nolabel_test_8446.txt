Scatter_nd bug

I'm getting strange bug with scatter_nd (TF 1.0v).
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Must have updates.shape = indices.shape[:IXDIM] +     
params_shape[IXDIM:], got updates.shape [1,2,4], indices.shape [1,2,2], params_shape [1,9,4]

I've read the docs for scatter_nd function and it seems to me that following set of shapes are perfectly viable:
Maybe I'm tired but, Using terms from the docs:
indices rank: Q = 3
shape rank : P = 3
last dim length for indices K = 2
updates rank:  = Q-1+P-K = 3-1+3-2=3
All seems to fit.
And full shape of update should be:
[indices_shape[0], indicies_shape[1], shape[K]]
which gives:
[1, 2, 4]
Where is the problem?
