Add comment to clarify semantics of opt_level parameter.

Note: This is my first PR against this project. Let me know if I've done anything wrong. I should be on IBM's corporate CLA.
The meaning of the opt_level parameter of OptimizerOptions was ambiguous, leading a user to open #11087 , which requests functionality that is actually already present but undocumented. This PR documents the functionality.
