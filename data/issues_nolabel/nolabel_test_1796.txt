Tensorflow serving with transfer learning retrained inception model

Hi
Trying to use a retrained inception model (as in the transfer learning tutorial) with Tensorflow serving as described by the example, here. However, I am unclear how to set up the exporter.
The exporter flow as shown in the tutorial looks as such:
export_path = sys.argv[-1] print 'Exporting trained model to', export_path saver = tf.train.Saver(sharded=True) model_exporter = exporter.Exporter(saver) signature = exporter.classification_signature(input_tensor=x, scores_tensor=y) model_exporter.init(sess.graph.as_graph_def(), default_graph_signature=signature) model_exporter.export(export_path, tf.constant(FLAGS.export_version), sess)
Since there is no "input_tensor" and "scores_tensor" as described by this tutorial within the Inception transfer learning, I am unsure of what tensors to use to get the signature. The bottleneck tensor? The ground_truth tensor?
I'd love an explanation of how to set up this retrained model with Tensorflow Serving as shown in this example!
Thanks
