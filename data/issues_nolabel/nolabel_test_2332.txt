install_name_tool error when running reduction_ops_test_gpu on OS X

I ran into this while testing my patch tensorflow/tensorflow#1289 on OS X. At first, I thought that it was caused by my patch but then I found that it also reproduces at HEAD.
I am not entirely sure whether this is a TensorFlow issue (the error seems to indicate that we need to add a ld flag) or a Bazel issue in the gcc wrapper.
