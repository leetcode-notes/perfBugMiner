Please clarify the documentation on eager execution and available host language functionalities

The documentation on eager execution here, particularly for the "fizzbuzz" example, does not reflect what tensorflow does. Specifically, all the comparisons num % x == y  do not work as the reader is expecting them to. According to me, it is not true that "all the functionality of the host language is available" because in order to make that code work I need to convert all the comparisons into num.numpy() % x == y (I have enabled eager execution).
