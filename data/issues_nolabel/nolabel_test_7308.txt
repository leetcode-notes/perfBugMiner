Small inaccuracy in Mandelbrot tutorial

Just noticed a small inaccuracy in  the Mandelbrot tutorial:
There is a snippet like this:
# Use NumPy to create a 2D array of complex numbers on [-2,2]x[-2,2]
Y, X = np.mgrid[-1.3:1.3:0.005, -2:1:0.005]

In the comment there is an area [-2,2]x[-2,2], but in the code itself it looks more like [-2.1]x[-1.3,1,3].
Nothing important but still slightly confusing :)
