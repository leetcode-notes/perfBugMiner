Feature Request: saver.save mkdir if directory not exist

Describe the problem
saver.save(sess, 'my-model')
returns error if directory not exist.
It would be nice if saver can automatically create the missing directory.
Traceback (most recent call last): File "tf_voice_recognition.py", line 783, in <module> saver.save(sess, 'my-model') File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py", line 1594, in save raise exc ValueError: Parent directory of my-model doesn't exist, can't save.
