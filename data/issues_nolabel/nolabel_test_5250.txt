NaN gradient after py_func call

Hello,
I did implemented faster rcnn with py_func op.

py-func is placed in the middle of graph. And there are the other path in parallel with py_func node.
I did not add any gradient function for it, So it should ignore gradient path through py_func. And gradient calculation should done with connection from the other path.

It works fine in tensorflow r0.9 version.
But, in the tensorflow version > r0.9, the node before py_func get NaN error when writing histogram summary. .
I did check several version: r0.10, r0.11, all of them does not worked.
Is there any change in gradient calculation for the node which have connection with py_func node ?
Or should I use py-func in different way?
Any advice will be helpful for me.
Thanks in advance.
