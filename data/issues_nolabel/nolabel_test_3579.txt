Steps to reproduce

Create any tensor (tf.Variable or tf.constant) containing batches of self adjoint matrices (call this B) and note its shape
run something like alpha_U = tf.batch_self_adjoint_eig(B)
look at B's shape again - the second to last dimension increments by 1

What have you tried?

selecting all but the last element of the second to last dimension solves the problem, but is hacky

B
<tf.Tensor 'Const_15:0' shape=(1, 3, 3) dtype=float32>
sess.run(B)
array([[[ 8.,  5.,  3.],
[ 5.,  2.,  4.],
[ 3.,  4.,  4.]]], dtype=float32)
alpha_U = tf.batch_self_adjoint_eig(B)
B
<tf.Tensor 'Const_15:0' shape=(1, 4, 3) dtype=float32>
sess.run(B)
array([[[ 8.,  5.,  3.],
[ 5.,  2.,  4.],
[ 3.,  4.,  4.]]], dtype=float32)
