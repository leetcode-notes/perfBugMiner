Would you mind not calling the protobuf repository protobuf?

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
Currently the protobuf repo in workspace.bzl is called @protobuf. Unfortunately, in github.com/grpc/grpc, the protobuf is bind to @com_github_google_protobuf//:protobuf....So if I have anything that uses the GRPC repository it cannot be built together with Bazel.
I tried rename all @protobuf// to @com_github_google_protobuf//, but it does not work, presumably because the patch file for protobuf get in the way.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
