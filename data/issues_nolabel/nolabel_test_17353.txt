Error indices[0] = 0 is not in [0, 0) while training an object-detection model with tensorflow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8
GPU model and memory:   Tesla K80 major: 3 minor: 7 memoryClockRate(GHz): 0.8755 , 11GB
Exact command to reproduce:
floyd run --gpu --env tensorflow-1.5 --data valiok98/datasets/raspberrypi2/3:/data --data valiok98/datasets/raspberrypi2/8:/mobilenet --data valiok98/datasets/raspberrypi2/9:/images --data valiok98/datasets/raspberrypi2/10:test_ckpt 'python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config'

For the record I tried with previous TF versions and it did not make  a diffrence.
So I am currently attempting to train a custom object-detection model on tensorflow to recognize images of a raspberrypi2. Everything is already set up and running on my hardware,but due to limitations of my gpu I settled for the cloud. I have uploaded my data(train & test records ans csv-files) and my checkpoint model. That is what I get from the logs:
tensorflow:Restoring parameters from /mobilenet/model.ckpt
tensorflow:Starting Session.
tensorflow:Saving checkpoint to path training/model.ckpt
tensorflow:Starting Queues.
tensorflow:Error reported to Coordinator: <class tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError'>,
indices[0] = 0 is not in [0, 0)
I also have a folder called images with the actual .jpg files and it is also on the cloud, but for some reason I must specify every directory with a preceeding forward slash / and that might be a problem, as I currently do not know whether some of the files are trying to import these images ,but could not find the path because of the missing /. If any of you happens to share a solution I would be really thankful.
And so here are my full logs:
PSTINFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from /mobilenet/model.ckpt
