Missing MPI collectives op symbols in TF build

Running into a build issue when trying to use MPI collectives. We are able to build a recent version of TF using NVIDIA's changes for CUDA 9/cuDNN 7. However, it appears that the build strips the MPI collectives library ops:
% python -c 'import tensorflow.contrib.mpi_collectives as mpi'
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
 File "/mnt/home/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/mpi_collectives/__init__.py", line 126, in <module>
   from tensorflow.contrib.mpi_collectives.mpi_ops import size
 File "/mnt/home/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/mpi_collectives/mpi_ops.py", line 59, in <module>
   'MPIAllreduce'])
 File "/mnt/home/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/mpi_collectives/mpi_ops.py", line 51, in _load_library
   (expected_op, name))
NameError: Could not find operator MPISize in dynamic library mpi_collectives.so

It seems like the issue might be caused by commit 5c7f9e3, which changes linking behavior, but we're unable to bisect due to commit order dependencies.
Anyone have an idea how to fix the issue? We're willing to update the MPI collectives code and submit a PR fix.
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): We've applied NVIDIA's CUDA 9/cuDNN 7 patches for mixed-precision per this page: http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#training_tensorflow
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 14.04
TensorFlow version (use command below): ea94bbe
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version: 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.0.103_rc/cuDNN 7.0-rc
Exact command to reproduce: python -c 'import tensorflow.contrib.mpi_collectives as mpi'
