Documentation Error

On website page:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
There is a documentation error:

To install TensorFlow, start a terminal command prompt instance. Then issue the appropriate pip3 install command below.
To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
cd %appdata%\..\Local\Programs\ython\Python35\Scripts
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
cd %appdata%\..\Local\Programs\ython\Python35\Scripts
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu


I.E. pip3 isn't registered as an executable on the system while following the standard Python 3.5 installation executable. Thus you have to navigate to the folder containing the executable first.
