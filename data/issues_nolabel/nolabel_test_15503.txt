Behavior change of tf.app.flags parsing boolean args

tf version 1.5.0-dev20171219
for example below args
flags.DEFINE_boolean('pre_calc_image_feature', False, '')
when using tf 1.4.1 it is ok to do --pre_calc_image_feature 0
which got FLAGS.pre_calc_image_feature == False.
But for tf 1.5 you must use --pre_calc_image_feature=0 if you still use --pre_calc_image_feature 0
then you will get FLAGS.pre_calc_image_feature == True.
Not sure if this is a bug or just by design but personally I think tf version 1.4.1 is better handling this case.
