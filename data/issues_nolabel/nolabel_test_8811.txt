Tensorflow Variables are Not Initialized using Between-graph Replication

I am running an issue for Distributed Tensorflow code with "Between-Graph Replication", which does not initialize Tensorflow Variables for some worker nodes. I posted the issue on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43084960/tensorflow-variables-are-not-initialized-using-between-graph-replication. My concern is if this is an issue/bug for MonitoredTrainingSession which uses SessionManager in Tensorflow. Thanks!
