Error with bazel and protobuf building a project that depends on tensorflow in Windows

We have a project that depends on Tensorflow, using the following in our WORKSPACE file:
local_repository(
name = "org_tensorflow",
path = workspace_dir + "/Libraries/TensorFlow/",
)
and
"@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/core:tensorflow"
under deps in the BUILD file.
It builds correctly on osX.
We also have a Windows machine that we've set up to build tensorflow (Standard set up: VS 2015 community, java 8, Anaconda Python 3.5, etc) and running the simple build (e.g. build a PIP wheel) works.
However, trying to build our project on Windows fails when it hits tensorflow's protos.
The precise error message is
ERROR: C:/tmp/Bazel/D6SVld$i/external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:272:1: null failed: protoc.exe failed: error executing command
cd C:/tmp/Bazel/D6SVld$i/execroot/face_tf_desktop

Trying to run that command manually in the shell produces:
bazel-out/vc_14_0_x64-opt/genfiles/external/protobuf/src: warning: directory does not exist.
(Accurately: the protobuf folder doesn't exist)
I'm not sure whether this is a bug in tensorflow or in Bazel (or, for that matter, whether the local_repository approach isn't meant to work and only works as a fluke on the Mac.)
I have tried building with the newest Bazel release 0.4.3, and previously with 0.4.1.
