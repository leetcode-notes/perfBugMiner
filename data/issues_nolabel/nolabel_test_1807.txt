KeyError: u'PlaceholderWithDefault' while running transfer learning model through Python

I followed the transfer learning example, and trained on my own image to create my model file. Then in the classify_image.py file, in place of the original 'classify_image_graph_def.pb' file, I replaced it with my model. However, while running I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "classify_image.py", line 214, in <module>
    tf.app.run()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/default/_app.py", line 30, in run
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
  File "classify_image.py", line 210, in main

    op_def = op_dict[node.op]
KeyError: u'PlaceholderWithDefault'


I can run my model fine through the terminal using bazel. Only through Python it is crashing. I'm using version 0.7.1.
Do I need to make any more changes in code before running?
