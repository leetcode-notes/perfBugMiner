adding placeholder_with_default in order to feed both via dataset and placeholders produces error on GPU

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4.0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.9.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:9.1.85
GPU model and memory:Titan V, 12G
Exact command to reproduce: See below

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
The issue is when you want to train a classifier that takes both placeholder and dataset via queue to feed input. The reason one may want to do that is to run inference via placeholders.
I added the following line under define the model section of train_image_classifier.py of slim library
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
_images = tf.placeholder_with_default(image, shape=[...], name='input)
I get an error of the following kind when running on GPU:
Cannot assign a device for operation 'input': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0'
