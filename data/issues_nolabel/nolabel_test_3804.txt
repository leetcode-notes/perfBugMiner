retrain.py, changed graph_util import statement

First attempt at a Pull Request, please be gentle:
I tried the TensorFlow For Poets tutorial today and followed the instructions, but retrain.py kept crashing because graph_util was being imported from the wrong location.  That's line 80.
After the change, the tutorial went as planned!
I also ran 2to3 on it...which apparently got rid of the from future_ statements.  Hmm.
The rest is just formatting changes, PEP8 stuff.
