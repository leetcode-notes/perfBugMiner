Make tf.pow work for integer inputs.

Currently tf.pow freezes if both inputs are integer tensors and y contains negative values. For example
the call
tf.pow(5, -2).eval()
never finishes.
The cause is the implementation of pow in Eigen. To get around this issue I've changed the
underlying C++ functor to treat differently integer inputs. However, tf.pow now returns float tensors on
input integer tensors.
In order to pass the backwards compatibility test, I had to create a new op IntegralPow for the case of
integer inputs. This mirrors the implementation of abs using Abs and ComplexAbs. I've made this
op hidden.
I've also added tests for the pow function in python.
This should fix issue #9560.
