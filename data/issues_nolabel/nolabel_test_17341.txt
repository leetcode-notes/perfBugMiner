Cannot import Tensorflow on a system that has anaconda installed, though tensorflow installed successfully

I installed tensorflow  on ubntu 16.04 by using
pip  install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

it sounds like that it is installed correct, after installation it shows that:
Collecting setuptools (from protobuf>=3.4.0->tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0)
  Using cached setuptools-38.5.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Now Im tryin to import tensorflow and i receive the following error:
