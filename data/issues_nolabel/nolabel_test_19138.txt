Describe the problem
I'm using google ml-engine to train a model for ctr-prediction(the training dataset is Imbalanced).
Following is the training log screenshot from ml-engine.

The problem is: the precision and recall values kept unchanged for some training steps as i annotated in the picture(auctually these two values kept unchanged for 2 epochs in this picture). I'm pretty sure this is a bug, but i don't know where is wrong.
Does any one can check the calculation of these two metrics(precision, recall) for me?
