Problem with label_image.py

I used docker toolbox on windows 10 64-bit and used this command
docker run -it gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel
to install tensorflow image.
After retraining of model is successfully done and when I run label_image.py it gives following message

I used this line
curl -L https://goo.gl/tx3dqg > $HOME/tf_files/label_image.py
and then
docker run -it -v $HOME/tf_files:/tf_files  gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel
