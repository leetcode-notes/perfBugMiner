Bazel Build Fails with "undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '@nccl_archive//:nccl'"

System information
The environment used is:
tf_env.txt
The branch downloaded is tensorflow-master branch
When I run the configure script the configuration is
.tf_configure.bazelrc
Describe the problem
When I run
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --config=mkl //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

The build fails with the error
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'external/nccl_archive/src/core.cu.cc':
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include-fixed/limits.h'
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include-fixed/syslimits.h'
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include/stddef.h'
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include/stdarg.h'
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build
FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully

but the files are present:
ls /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include-fixed/limits.h
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/include-fixed/limits.h

There appears to be a problem with bazel build with MKL enabled.  I have been able to compile this with MKL disabled. MKL for Ubuntu should be supported, yes?
