how to assign values in Tensor according to the indices?

I want to assign values in a tensor according to the indices.
For example, According to the pooling values and the corresponding indices output of tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax, I want to put these pooling values back into the original unpooling Tensor given the indices.
According to the trick in Adjust Single Value within Tensor â€” TensorFlow
I can recreate sparse tensor with the indices.
But here is the problem: tf.SparseTensor  should input the unflattened indices i.e. the ndims coordinates list.
If I use this method, how to unravel the flattened indices obtained by tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax to the normal indices?
If I do not use this method, is there any way in Tensorflow to achieve this work?
Thank you very much.
