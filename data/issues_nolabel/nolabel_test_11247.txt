Standalone Embedding Projector does not load bookmarks

The standalone Embedding Projector does not open the Load bookmarks window for me all of a sudden. Save bookmarks and everything else still works though.
I am on Windows 7 (Enterprise) using Chrome (Google Chrome	59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit) (cohort: Stable)).
