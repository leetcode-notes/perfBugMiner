Compiling TensorFlow 1.4.0 GPU on Windows 10 x64

There doesn't seem to be any detailed documentation for how to compile TensorFlow 1.4.0 GPU on Windows 10 x64.
I need to recompile TF to add missing functionality for a Windows 7 x64 production system.
I can use Bazel or CMake to compile something but how do I incorporate the Python and NVIDIA dependencies into that build?
How are the Windows wheels at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow-gpu compiled?
