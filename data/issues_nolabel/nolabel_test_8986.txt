Inception v1, v2 - ValueError: Can not squeeze dim[1], expected a dimension of 1, got 2 for 'InceptionV2/Logits/SpatialSqueeze' (op: 'Squeeze') with input shapes: [1,2,2,1000].

Hello,
I'm trying to run a few different inception models with their checkpoints from the pretrained models table here. I've managed to get v3, v4, and resnet v2 working. v1 and v2 however I'm getting the issue above. I'm using the latest tensorflow and pulled the latest off the repo. Below is the code I use to load the model.
checkpoint_file = os.getcwd() + '\inception_v2.ckpt'
#Load the model
sess = tf.Session()
arg_scope = inception_v2_arg_scope()

with slim.arg_scope(arg_scope):
      logits, end_points = inception_v2(scaled_input_tensor, is_training=False)
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_file)
