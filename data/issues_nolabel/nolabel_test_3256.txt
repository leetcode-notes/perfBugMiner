[feature request]copy lstm parameters

I'm using tensorflow to implement DQN network and use LSTM at the bottom layer.
But in DQN, a target network is used(coping the main network and keep it for a while, and at the mean time update the original network), when use the tf.Variable as parameter A, I can use tf.Variable.assign to copy A to A', but when I use LSTM, it seems like there is no way to do this copy operation.
Or maybe there is a way to copy the whole graph include its variable weights?
