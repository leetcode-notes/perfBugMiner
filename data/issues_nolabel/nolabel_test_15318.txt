tensorflow multigpu with dataset api is not converging

I am trying to train a resNet50  on multi_gpus,
I have used
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/image/cifar10/cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py)
and I have added tensorflow Dataset input pipeline to the link code
But after some steps loss is some value and does not changes any more!(value =0.693147 always)
I have tested this network with dataset API on single gpu,and worked fine.
Im sure something is wrong with my data feeding,because when I feed a simple random nd_array,it converges!!!!!
I have tested my tfrecord file,it was OK .
but I dont know the problem.
I use
ubuntu 16.04,
tensorflow 1.4,
python 2.7.12,
gtx 1080 Gpus
this is all my train code:
