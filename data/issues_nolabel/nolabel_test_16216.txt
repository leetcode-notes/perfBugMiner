Resize tensor in tflite

hi,I save my cnn model into pb file, and  change it into tflite model.  In android I can run the model well with tensorflow lite.
I have a problem that the input tensor size of inference must be euqal to the input tensor size of training, because the intermediate variables  size of the model are determined by the input tensor size of training. But for my  cnn model, it can process the input tensor size that is not euqal to the input tensor size of training.
so  How can  i reshape the intermeidate varibales shape to match the  input tensor size of inference before inference? In other wordsï¼Œ How can i do to let my cnn model process the input tensor whose size is not euqal to the input tensor size of traning? thx.
