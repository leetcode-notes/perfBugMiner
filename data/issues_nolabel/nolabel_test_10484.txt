Can not execute hexagon_graph_execution on hexagon-sim

@satok16 I have followed the build_and_run_inception_hexagon.sh and generated the hexagon_graph_execution executable. Now instead of using a real device I would like to test inception model with "hexagon-sim" available at SDK 3.0. So there is no need to use adb push commands as the SDK can simulate HVX device with hexagon-sim.
I have put the run-time libraries and the inception model plus the image at the same folder. After execution It gives me this error:
 ~/Qualcomm/HEXAGON_Tools/7.2.12/Tools/bin/hexagon-sim ./hexagon_graph_execution "/home/aashouri/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/3.0/test/common/inception"
Error: Unsupported machine type 0x0 in ELF image "./hexagon_graph_execution" - exiting.

Could you comment on this ? Thanks
