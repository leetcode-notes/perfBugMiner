TensorFlow upgrade to 1.0.1

I upgraded my server from 1.0.0 (ubuntu):
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
But I get the following discrepancy:
(tensorflow)$ pip list | grep tensorflow
tensorflow (1.0.0)
(tensorflow)$ python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version)'
1.0.1
