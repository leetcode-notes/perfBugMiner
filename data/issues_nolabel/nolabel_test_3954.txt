Linux Shell does not appear when installing Tensorflow in Dockers (Win7)

Following these instructions:
http://www.netinstructions.com/how-to-install-and-run-tensorflow-on-a-windows-pc/`
executing the last command in cmd shell (Win7):
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
cmd is downloading, pulling, then Jupyiter notebook services gets started..., but then I get warnings and the linux shell does not appear:
C:\Users\user>docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
