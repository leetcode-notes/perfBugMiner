R1.3

On Windows, after reinstalling Anaconda3 I run the command
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
to create a tensorflow environment within Anaconda installation in the hidden user appdata folder.
Then I opened the new and updated navigator of anaconda. Changed the environment from root to tensorflow. I was given the option to install Spyder. That I did. Within minutes it installed Spyder within the tensorflow environment.
The first two Tensorflow programs in the guide ran perfectly and smoothly.
