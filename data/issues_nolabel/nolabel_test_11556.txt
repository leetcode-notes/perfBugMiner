Correct learning rate in code snippet.

Correct the learning rate in code snippet, such that it reflects the expected outcome, ~92%, instead of ~90%.
If this discrepancy is intentional, feel free to close this request. It's such a small fix I figured I'd submit the request just in case the change was accidental.
I would note that the change is fixed in the master brach, however the problem is currently reflected in the production docs, which is confusing to beginners, like myself.
