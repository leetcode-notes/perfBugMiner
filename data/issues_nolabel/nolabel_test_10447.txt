Tensorflow Errors with uint8 addition

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0
GPU model and memory:
Nvidia Titan X Pascal
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
a=tf.constant([1],dtype=tf.uint8)
b=tf.constant([2],dtype=tf.uint8)
c=a+b
session=tf.Session()
with session.as_default():
    session.run(c)

Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
It appears as thought uint8 addition is not supported.  This is odd.  When running the above code I get the error:
InvalidArgumentError: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Add' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU,GPU], Registered kernels:
