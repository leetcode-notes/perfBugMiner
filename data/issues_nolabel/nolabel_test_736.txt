Build tools and versions listed in Jenkins build log.

Since TensorFlow is built regularly and it success it reported on the GitHub page, it would be nice to see in the logs e.g. (http://ci.tensorflow.org/job/tensorflow-master/47/configure) the OS configuration, tools used and their version. This way if people want to know what tools and version of the tools currently work they would be available and automatically updated.

OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Memory: 2G
Swap space: 2G
Processor: i7
Free hard disk space: 2G
