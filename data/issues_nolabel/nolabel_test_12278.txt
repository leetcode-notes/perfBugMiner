Integrating both Tensorflow an Caffe in C++

System information

I  wrote custom code
Ubuntu 14.04:
TensorFlow installed from source
TF 1.2.1:
C++ API
No Bazel
CUDA 7.5

Describe the problem
Hello!
I am trying to write a code in C++ using the Eclipse IDE without Bazel. To get my project to do this I had to perform some hacks to generate the Tensorflow C++ APIs. Tensorflow C++ seems to be working fine. I can load a model and perform predictions. I have another code that uses a Caffe library to do something else. These both seem to work fine separately.
I want to integrate BOTH Tensorflow and Caffe in my code. When I include both libraries I get issues that seem to imply that both TF C++ and Caffe(which uses glog) redefine certain things. This leads to my code not working.
Is there a way to make TF use glog? Am I doing something wrong? It seems that this is a bug....
Thank you for any help
