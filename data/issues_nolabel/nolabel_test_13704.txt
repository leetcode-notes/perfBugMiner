Clarify low-latency model stride length

first_filter_stride_y = 4 has no effect, since first_filter_height = input_time_size. If cnn-one-fstride4 should be used, then first_filter_stride_x should be 4 instead. However, during my experimentation cnn-one-fstride4 provided significantly worse results than the current TF impl, so I think the impl is fine.
This small fix just clarifies that the model isn't striding in the time dimension.
