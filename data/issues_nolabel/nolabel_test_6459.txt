If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
The problem, such as it is, is that I installed cuda using the rpms provided by Nvidia.  These place cuda under /usr.  The big thing, building from source is that cudnn.h is now under /usr/include/cuda, as is the CUPTI directory.  There may be other differences.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Since I was just trying to build the android demos, I ran configure without configuring cuda.  That let me build the android demos.  The pip install for tensorflow cuda works OK for my host.  It's more of a cosmetic thing since a few symlinks will get past it.
