Describe the problem
Hi,
I'm trying to compile the android demo example project just released the August 11, 2017.
I'm building it with Android Studio and gradlle.
The build fails downloading the SSD-Mobilenet model with this error :
Execution failed for task ':downloadFile'.
> org.apache.http.client.ClientProtocolException: Forbidden

I can download the other models, but not this one.
How can I fix it ?
Thanks
