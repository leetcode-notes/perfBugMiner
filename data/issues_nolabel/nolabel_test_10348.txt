Android Detect App does not draw overlay correctly.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): [No] Further troubleshooting shows a minor change may cause this.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Android 7.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): N/A (Nightly apk)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1,1.2
Phone Hardware: Pixel C Tablet
Exact command to reproduce: Use the Detect App and move your target off centre

Describe the problem
Due to how the Detect act appears to process it's imagery and camera fragments etc it means that the overlay that's drawn drifts from the target when off centre. (Will try to post pics when I can.)
Part of this issue appears to be the fact that camera preview shown in the app is oddly cropped and squished from what the app actually sees (from debug view). Because of this, when the overlays are drawn they do not match the camera feed below. (Noticeable when your target object is towards the edge of the input)
Source code / logs
To reproduce, install the app, load up an image of a human on google images and move your camera so it's on the edge. It doesn't line up with the camera preview. Moving this from side to side helps show the problem.
I have spent many hours at work trying to understand why this is. Unfortunately I find the source code very difficult to work with and understand how it at all works. I've had to start again but I came across this bug.
Thanks
