Tensorboard smoothing 1st order lag filter

@dandelionmane  This is an alternative to PR7891, since you mentioned you are considering alternative ways forward.
It replaces the use of a moving average window with a simple first-order lag filter. It has a few advantages: 1) A bit less code. 2) It doesn't require visiting a potentially large number of values in the window to be averaged when computing each smoothed value. 3) The degree of smoothing doesn't change when you get near the end of the curve.
I left the changes in the html file so you could just run it without having to rebuild.
Here's what it does on the same data shown in the other PR.
