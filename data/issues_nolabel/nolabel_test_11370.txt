Feature Request: Include Depthwise Convolution in graph_transforms fold_batch_norms

Hi!
Currently, the graph_transforms tool includes only Conv2D and MatMul ops when folding batch normalization scaling/multiplication into its weights, as in fold_batch_norms.cc. Google's Mobilenet example uses depthwise convolution extensively, so it would be nice to include this feature for the DepthwiseConv2dNative operation. The problem here is that weights are ordered differently for this operation and contain the channel_muliplier which would need to be checked when trying to bake subsequent multiplications.
