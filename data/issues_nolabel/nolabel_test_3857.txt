(Eigen thirdparty) Can't compile fixed point matrix matrix multiply

I can't get the Eigen fixed point backend to compile a simple matrix matrix multiply with Intel AVX2.
Anyone got a working example? I think the PacketMathAVX2.h is either missing something or I need to tell Eigen to align the matrices somehow. But I'm at a loss.
Here is a simple C++ code that highlights the issue.
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#define EIGEN_VECTORIZE_AVX
#define EIGEN_VECTORIZE_AVX2
#include <unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor>
#include <unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/FixedPoint>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    Eigen::QInt8 dbg((float)1.5), dbg2((float)2.5), dbg3;
    Eigen::Matrix<Eigen::QInt32,32,32>one,two,three;

    dbg3 = dbg + dbg2;
    dbg3 = dbg * dbg2;
    dbg3 = dbg - dbg2; //OK
    three = one * two;   //Does not compile
    return 0;
}

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 lts, Eigen3.3-beta2 gcc 4.9.3 cmake 3.2.2
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
libcudart.so.7.5.18

The commit hash:  da41c02
The output of bazel version NA

Steps to reproduce

Install Eigen3.3-beta2
Merge tensorflow/thirdparty/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen with Eigen3.3-beta2root/unsupported/Eigen
build the example code listing following these steps https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html

What have you tried?

building without AVX defines
confirmed that non-matrix algebra works ok
