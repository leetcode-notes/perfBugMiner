Minor fix to saved_model/builder_impl.py docstring

I believe that there is a minor problem with the python API documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/builder/SavedModelBuilder. The first line of the "typical usage" example should read
builder = saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder(export_dir)
rather than
builder = saved_model_builder.SavedModelBuilder(export_dir).
This pull request should fix the issue.
