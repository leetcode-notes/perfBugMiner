[Windows] Enable tf.contrib.tensor_forest in CMake build and tests

Fixes error message appears when loading an OpKernel without the corresponding op. For example:
E c:\tf_jenkins\home\workspace\release-win\device\cpu\os\windows\tensorflow\core\framework\op_kernel.cc:943] OpKernel ('op: "BestSplits" device_type: "CPU"') for unknown op: BestSplits

Since we're building the kernels anyway, this change also runs the tensor_forest tests.
Fixes #6500. (Note however that the hybrid ops are not yet ported to work on Windows.)
