graph.pb.h missing

The issue is quite simple: I downloaded and built TF from source, but the include files like tensorflow/core/public/session.h reference non-existing files. One culprit is tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h. Attempted compilation produces the following error:
22:31:27 **** Build of configuration Debug for project hello_world ****
make all
make: Warning: File `objects.mk' has modification time 1,8e+02 s in the future
Building file: ../src/hello_world.cpp

#include "tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h"
^
compilation terminated.
I cannot rule out a mistake on my part, but I've tried a bunch of things to no avail. Either a file is missing or there may be a linking issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
None
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

Which pip package you installed.
I followed these steps:

1 git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
2 run ./configure
3 bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
4 bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
5 pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.7.1-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)".
0.7.1

If installed from sources, provide the commit hash:
not sure, retrieved on 11 april from terminal:
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
Steps to reproduce

The error occurs simply when any file from TF is included in c++
example:
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"

What have you tried?

Reinstall/upgrade: pip, bazel, tensorflow, gcc/g++, add additional include paths
