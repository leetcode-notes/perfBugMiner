A tutorial for new dynamic seq2seq

New contrib.seq2seq made it into master - exciting development! However, the only examples are in the tests. For my project, I've implemented a small but complete example against a toy copy task. Here it is: notebook, code.
Can I contribute it? I do realise that API is likely not yet complete. Iâ€™ll be happy to keep it updated and improve it if needed.
