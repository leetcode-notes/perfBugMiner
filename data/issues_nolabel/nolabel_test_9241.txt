Module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'constant' after local pip installation

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
when i install tensor flow with gpu support from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
it works with some warnings that certain libraries could be faster.
when i install local pip pacakge following https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources
i get this

I have looked on stackoverflow, tensorflow github and i have made sure my situation is different. i am not using tensorflow as a filename, nor I am in the source directory where config is launched.
i have checked directory permissions on site-packages and it looks good.
i uninstalled the gpu package 1.0.1-cp34 before i installed local pip.

What am I missing?
Source code / logs
local source
karun@karunlindev3:~/shadow/tensorflow$ ls

Here is the output for installation of loca pip. I noticed that there are a LOT more files from the gpu package on googlapis than local pip
