Tensorflow inception speed issue

hello this is Rohan Naik,
i developed an app which interact with tensorflow running on server and shows parking spaces available for your car.
i am using inception model which was retrained and modified to process live video and tell the users where parking slots are available.
The issue is it takes a 10 seconds to process 8 thread which run the image recognition function. Is there any way i can make it run faster.
Is "tensorflow slim" model can process the images faster?
