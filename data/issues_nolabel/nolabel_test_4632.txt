Random Uniform distribution cannot have Batch as a dimension

tf.random_uniform((None, 10))
Results in an error
TypeError: Expected binary or unicode string, got (None, 10)
Likewise
tf.random_uniform((-1, 10))
Results in an error
ValueError: Dimension -1 must be >= 0
Although you could pass the random matrix in as a placeholder, this is awkward..
