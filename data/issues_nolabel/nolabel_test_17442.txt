gradient back propagation through image transforms

As we know from the description of tf.contrib.image.transform(images, transforms): "Note that gradients are not backpropagated into transformation parameters".
Here, I would like to know whether gradients can be correctly backpropagated into images?
If yes, whether it is automatic?
Do I need to explicitly define the gradient using gradient_map_override?
Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks
