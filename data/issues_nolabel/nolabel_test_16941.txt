System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution:
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.5.0
Python version:
2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.10.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
5.4.0
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --copt=-march=native //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I am trying to install Tensorflow on my laptop which has i5 and 8GB RAM.
When I am building the Tensorflow from source
I use
bazel build --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --copt=-march=native //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Everything seems to go well but at the end I get this error
`ERROR: /home/siladittya/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/BUILD:3166:1: Linking of rule '//tensorflow/python:_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so' failed (Exit 1)

/usr/bin/ld.gold: fatal error: bazel-out/k8-opt/bin/tensorflow/core/kernels/_objs/quantize_and_dequantize_op/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.pic.o: read: Input/output error

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build

`
I looked up a few posts in some forums, but they are saying that it can be solved using --local_resources but when I used that argument,
`bazel build --local_resources 8000,2.0,2.0 --cxxopt="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package`

I am getting the same error again.
But it doesn't seem to be a error which can be solved using --local_resources because it doesn't work.
What else can be the solution to this problem?
