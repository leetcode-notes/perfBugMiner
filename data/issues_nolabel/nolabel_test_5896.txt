VocabularyProcessor does not work with Chinese

In order to train a model with tensorflow, try to use tf.contrib.learn.preprocessing.VocabularyProcessor to get a vocabulary vector.
def create_vocab(input_iter, min_frequency):
  """
  Creates and returns a VocabularyProcessor object with the vocabulary
  for the input iterator.
  """
  vocab_processor = tf.contrib.learn.preprocessing.VocabularyProcessor(
      FLAGS.max_sentence_len,
      min_frequency=min_frequency,
      tokenizer_fn=tokenizer_fn)
  vocab_processor.fit(input_iter)
  return vocab_processor


It works well with English. But all the Chinese words are not parsed. They are treated as a single word.
