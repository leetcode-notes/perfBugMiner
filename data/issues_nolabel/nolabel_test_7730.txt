[Java] [Feature] Tensor clone

Allows a tensor to be cloned (shallow), resulting in a new tensor
sharing the same underlying buffer.
The cloned tensor is still usable after the original is closed.  This
is possible because the buffer supports reference counting.

Added TF_Clone to the C API.
Added Tensor::clone to the Java API.
