I followed the ios_example from here, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples
I successfully installed the static library containing the core code of tensorflow;
I downloaded the incetption v1, and I have xcode 7.3.1 installed on my Mac;
When I launch xcode from tf_ios_makefile_example.xcodeproj in the subfolder tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/simple, I got un error:
include "unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor"
What did I miss? the version of eigen is not right? I do install eigen.
Any suggestion will be appreciated
Thanks
