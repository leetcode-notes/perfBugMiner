Fix issue in tf.nn.softmax where negative dims could only be -1

This fix tries to address the issue raised in #14916 where negative dims could only be -1 in tf.nn.softmax.
The issue was that dims=-1 was handled as a case of "last dim" with is_last_dim = (dim is -1) or (dim == shape.ndims - 1), but the generic negative dims were never processed.
This fix adds dim += shape.ndims for generic negative dims, and add additional test cases.
This fix fixes #14916.
