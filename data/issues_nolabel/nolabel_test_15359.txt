code is jammed when evaluate

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):YES
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):win10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):pip3
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0 6.46
GPU model and memory:2GB
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
the code is jammed when run eval_results = pc_classifier.evaluate(input_fn = pcd.test_input_fn_np)
I built model under the guidance of cnn_mnist.py . the differences are that I change the network architecture  and using my input_functioin. Everything is normal during the training process, but it jammed during the evaluate process.
the call stack is:

and it jammed at the code
for hook in self._hooks: hook.after_run( run_context, session_run_hook.SessionRunValues( results=outputs[hook] if hook in outputs else None, options=options, run_metadata=run_metadata))
what's the problem?
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
