orthogonal_initializer bug fix

Fixed a bug in "orthogonal_initializer" function in init_ops.py file.
The original way of generating a random matrix(random_uniform) is not scaled to make the mean value to 0.

This will cause the value in the first "block" of the returned matrix, which is corresponding to the largest singular value, very close to each other.
In convolutional neural network, if the initial parameters of a kernel are similar to each other, then all the parameters will update very similarly, which is a really bad thing for training.

The bug is fixed by simply using the random_normal function to generate the random matrix. This will work because the default parameters for random_normal are mean=0.0, stddev=1.0
