opencv imported after tensorflow can't read jpeg

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.
If installed from sources, provide the commit hash: f952246
Steps to reproduce
$ python2 -c "import tensorflow; import cv2; print cv2.imread('cat.jpg')"
None
What have you tried?
import cv2 before tensorflow works.
This problem also exists on CentOS 7. It doesn't happen on a latest ArchLinux.
It's likely due to that tensorflow has it's own libjpeg that conflicts with opencv on some platforms.
