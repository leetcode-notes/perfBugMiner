Index into tensor

I'd like to have a tf.index function that works like this:
import tensorflow as tf

weights = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 1, 2])

indexed = tf.index(weights, indices)
#indexed = [[0, 0], [2, 2], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
That is, indexed[i] = weights[indices[i]]. Of the existing functions, tf.slice comes close, but it doesn't seem to allow for multiple slices. A less efficient way of doing this is to use tf.one_hot and a matrix multiply, but this should be straightforward to do.
