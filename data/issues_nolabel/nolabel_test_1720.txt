Eigen version in cmake mismatch

In tensorflow/contrib/cmake/external/eigen.cmake, both eigen_archive_hash and eigen_HASH don't match those in tensorflow/workspace.bzl and the source (e.g. third_party/eigen3/Eigen/Cholesky). This leads to build failure when using cmake.
Could anyone update tensorflow/contrib/cmake/external/eigen.cmake?
