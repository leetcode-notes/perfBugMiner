Input Pipeline for High-performance Model

Describe the problem
When using data_flow_op.RecordInput in input pipeline on distributed TensorFlow, every input thread seems load all files in the data_dir to the local buffer after shuffling and left-shifting all matched file names in data_dir (
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/record_yielder.cc
    
    
         Line 139
      in

           shard->filenames.push_back(filenames[j]); 
        
    
  

).
Based on the code, it seems like data input for each epoch ends with loading all files instead of part of the files on every worker.
If I understand correctly, each input thread from each worker task should read a portion of the files, which should be the shift_ratio * file_num. It will be very helpful, if anyone can explain this.
