Fix a potential bug for android demo

Size of the priority queue will decrease in every iteration, so the terminal condition will change,  but i increase in every iteration, it will lead to some problems. For example, when MAX_RESULTS = 10andpq.size() = 4 in the beginning, after 2 iterations,  i = 2, the  terminal condition will become i < 2, but it  is wrong.
