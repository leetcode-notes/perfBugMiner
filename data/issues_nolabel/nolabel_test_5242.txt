Windows GPU gradient always 0 but CPU works

Hello all,
I was working on installing and testing the new windows gpu support and it does not seem to be working right for me. To start off, I was following this and I have all of the same software as their windows 10 known good configuration, except I have Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 with Visual C++ 2015.
My github head is: 2cbb9b5
After I few times of trying to get it to install, I managed to get it to install by changing to cmake 3.6 from 3.7. It installed fine but it does not seem to work properly.
I downloaded some known good code, file here, and when I run it specifiying that tensorflow should use cpu, I get good output that looks like this. If I allow it to run on gpu, I get bad output that looks like this. I am not sure why. I feel like it is probably an issue with my install even though it had no errors. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
