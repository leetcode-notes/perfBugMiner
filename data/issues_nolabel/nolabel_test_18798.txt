Changing output/reaction at the moment of detection

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No, I've followed a tutorial and haven't touched the base setup of it. https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): Couldn't get the capture script to return this
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): b'unknown'
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0 / 7.05
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M / 2Gb?
Exact command to reproduce: No idea

Describe the problem
Hello TensorFlow and everyone else,
I was wondering where in the code we can change the output or rather, the reaction the framework has on a detected item. Quick notice: I have no prior Python experience so it's a bit difficult to go around and deduce code.
For simplicity, let's say, at the moment Tensor detects an object, i'd like to create a file. I've been looking around but can not find a structure or UML-diagram saying which code leads to which, so I have no solid idea where to begin. I'd be very greatful if any directions could be given.
Thanks in advance
