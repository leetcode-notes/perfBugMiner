Server restarts silently on kubernetes and variables reset after restart

Environment info
Operating System:
Kubernetes with default images
Steps to reproduce
Hard to reproduce due to lack of log
Logs or other output that would be helpful
The kubernetes status:
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tf-ps2-l2ka8       1/1       Running   0          3h
tf-ps4-2jmuf       1/1       Running   1          3h
tf-worker1-fm1t8   1/1       Running   1          3h
tf-worker3-ujd7h   1/1       Running   0          3h
tf-worker5-ymx71   1/1       Running   0          3h

The log regarding restarted parameter server:
zeyu@perhaps:~$ kubectl logs -p tf-ps4-2jmuf
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_channel.cc:206] Initialize HostPortsGrpcChannelCache for job worker -> {tf-worker1:2222, tf-worker3:2222, tf-worker5:2222}
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_channel.cc:206] Initialize HostPortsGrpcChannelCache for job ps -> {tf-ps2:2222, localhost:2222}
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_server_lib.cc:202] Started server with target: grpc://localhost:2222

The log of current running server: (almost the same)
zeyu@perhaps:~$ kubectl logs  tf-ps4-2jmuf
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_channel.cc:206] Initialize HostPortsGrpcChannelCache for job worker -> {tf-worker1:2222, tf-worker3:2222, tf-worker5:2222}
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_channel.cc:206] Initialize HostPortsGrpcChannelCache for job ps -> {tf-ps2:2222, localhost:2222}
I tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_server_lib.cc:202] Started server with target: grpc://localhost:2222

As the result of the restart, the global count  reset to 0 and the running log looks like:
Training step 269, global step 802
Training step 270, global step 805
Training step 271, global step 808
Training step 272, global step 810
Training step 273, global step 3
Training step 274, global step 6
Training step 275, global step 12
Training step 276, global step 19
Training step 277, global step 22
Training step 278, global step 27
Training step 279, global step 32

Is there any way that I can materialize the variables (like hostpath or persistent disk?) so that they won't be affected by restarts?
