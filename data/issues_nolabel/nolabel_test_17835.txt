[Doc] Clarification on tf.contrib.lookup.MutableHashTable insert operation

Document on MutableHashTable is confusing, especially in this line:
table.insert(keys, values)
This code is unexecutable and misleading, it suggests insert is done inplace rather than an operation that need to be executed afterwards.
I think it shall be replaced by:
sess.run(table.insert(keys, values))
