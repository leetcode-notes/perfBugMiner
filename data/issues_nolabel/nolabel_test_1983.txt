Steps to reproduce
I tried to build tensorflow from source on macbook pro. It only looks for .so cuda library but on mac the shared libraries end with .dylib. Also it only looks for lib64 sub-directory, which is not present for cuda 7.5 on mac, in which the libraries are in /usr/local/cuda/lib folder. Does the configure script support mac with gpu now?
Tianweis-Macbook:tensorflow STW$ ./configure
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/local/bin/python]:
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GPU support? [y/N] y
GPU support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Please specify which gcc nvcc should use as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]:
Please specify the Cuda SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]:
Please specify the location where CUDA  toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Invalid path to CUDA  toolkit. /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so cannot be found
Please specify the Cuda SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]:
What have you tried?
I tried to build tensorflow on mac with GPU support. It seems that tensorflow only supports gpu build on linux?
