Determining if A Value is in a Set

Hey TF,
The logical_or, logical_and, and select functions are very useful.
However, suppose you have value x, and you wanted to see if it was in a set(a,b,c,d,e). In python you would simply write:
if x in set([a,b,c,d,e]):
   #do action
As far as I can tell, the only way to do this in tensorflow, is to have nested 'logical_or' along with 'tf.equal'. I provided just one iteration of this concept below:
tf.logical_or(
tf.logical_or(tf.equal(x, a), tf.equal(x,b)),
tf.logical_or(tf.equal(x, c), tf.equal(x,d)),
)

I feel that there must be an easier way to do this in tensorflow. Is there?
