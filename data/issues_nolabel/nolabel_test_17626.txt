'unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor' file not found on iOS

when I ran this two projects( https://github.com/yjmade/ios_camera_object_detection )( https://github.com/jeffxtang/yolov2_tf_ios ) on ios. I met this warning.
Stack Overflow didn't give any help, case #4680 is for Raspberry Pi. It didn't help me.
Describe the problem

why you close a different issue which isn't solved?
