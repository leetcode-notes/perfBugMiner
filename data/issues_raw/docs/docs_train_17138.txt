Windows installation page lists wrong cudnn version

The windows installation pages specifically asks to use cuDNN 6 - link. Then, when running tensorflow it looks specifically for cuDNN7.
% (build_info.cudnn_dll_name, build_info.cudnn_version_number))

ImportError: Could not find 'cudnn64_7.dll'. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Note that installing cuDNN is a separate step from installing CUDA, and this DLL is often found in a different directory from the CUDA DLLs. You may install the necessary DLL by downloading cuDNN 7 from this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
Would be great if the page modified this to specifically ask for cuDNN 7.
