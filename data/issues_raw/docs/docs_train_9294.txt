Tutorial has error: Recurrent Neural Networks

Tutorial URL: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent
I'm going through the tutorial listed above and I think there is a mistake in the very first code example:
lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(lstm_size)
# Initial state of the LSTM memory.
state = tf.zeros([batch_size, lstm.state_size])

An error is reported for the third line:
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.

If one prints the lstm.state_size object (where say, lstm_size = 50) one finds:
LSTMStateTuple(c=50, h=50)

I'm guessing this should be:
lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(lstm_size)
# Initial state of the LSTM memory.
state = tf.zeros([batch_size, lstm_size])

But frankly there are numerous other errors in this tutorial as well, so I'm not sure.  I will continue to report them as I find them.
