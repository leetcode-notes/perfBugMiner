Tensorflow 1.5.0 Import Error on CUDA 9.0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No, I used the stock version.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip binary for windows with GPU support
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: Python 3.6.1 from Anaconda
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/7.0.5
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

Describe the problem
Installed CUDA/CUDNN 8.0/6, 9.0/7, 9.1/7
Used pip to install tensorflow_gpu 1.5.0
The installation process finished normally.
However, when import the module by "import tensorflow as tf", error messages raises and it says ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_90.dll'.
I double checked the CUDA_PATH and PATH environmental variables to make sure that CUDA/CUDNN 9.0/7 are being used. Later I removed the 8.0/6 and 9.1/7, and the problem still exists.
