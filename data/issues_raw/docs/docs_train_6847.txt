Better documentation for tf.extract_image_patches

In this issue someone requested a reverse operation to tf.extract_image_patches. The comments suggest that there exists a gradient operation for this purpose which was added with this PR.
Unfortunately it is not obvious how to apply this gradient operation and there are no information on this in the api docs therefor I request to add an example to tf.extract_image_patches where one transforms an image tensor of shape (image_height, image_width, channels) to (patch_num, patch_height, patch_width, channels) and vice versa.
Thank you in advance!
