Document trick with slash in scope names

The documentation for tf.name_scope is rather ambiguous on what happens if the scope name ends with '/', merely stating what happens if it doesn't end with a '/'. The fact that the behavior is different, specifically that ending with a '/' does not result in automatically uniqueifying the scope name, is very important and useful, because sometimes one wants to reenter a previously created scope. This possibility is only alluded to when describing recapturing scope variables, but the functionality is more general than that.
