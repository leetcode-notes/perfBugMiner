ios documentation for tensorflow-experimental

Could we have a proper documentation (either in the pod files with a custom header) or in the readme?
It would help greatly to have the list of available methods and what they do (unless method name is self-explanatory).
Having to dig into ~20 objective-c files to get a grasp of what is possible in swift is not equivalent to a proper documentation
