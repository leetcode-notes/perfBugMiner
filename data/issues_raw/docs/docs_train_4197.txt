Incorrect documentation for dynamic_rnn

The help for tf.nn.dynamic_rnn states that the optional initial_state kwarg, if cell.state_size is an integer, must be a Tensor of appropriate type and shape [batch_size x cell.state_size]. This is incorrect; the shape must be actually be [batch_size, cell.state_size].
