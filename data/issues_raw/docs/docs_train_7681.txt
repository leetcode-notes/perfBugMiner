DOCS for offsets in extract_glimpse don't match Implementation

Docs state:

offsets: A Tensor of type float32.
A 2-D integer tensor of shape [batch_size, 2] containing
the x, y locations of the center of each window.

whereas the implementation states:

 // calling TensorFlow operates with (y,x) as indices.


Notice x,y vs y,x
Here is a rough demo of the issue:
arr = np.zeros((1,5,5,1), dtype=np.float32)
arr[0, 3,2] = 1
arr = tf.constant(arr)
glim = tf.image.extract_glimpse(arr, (1,1), offsets=tf.constant([(2,3)], dtype=tf.float32)[:,::-1] + 1, normalized=False, centered=False)
sess.run(glim)
> array([[[[ 1.]]]], dtype=float32)

It appears that the docs are wrong and that the comment is right.
