Missing documentation for using the Dataset API in combination with image summaries

The Dataset API is now the recommended input pipeline, however I am missing some guidance on how to include summaries of my images.
def get_data():
  dataset = FixedLengthRecordDataset(...)
  dataset = dataset.map(parse_dataset, ...)
  if is_training:
    dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_for_train, ...)
  # Do shuffling, batching...
  return dataset

def preprocess_for_train(image, label):
  # Do preprocessing...
  image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image)
  # Add summary
  tf.summary.image('preprocessed_image', tf.expand_dims(image, 0))
  return image, label
This is what I would do intuitively, but since map() uses a different thread and therefore a different tf.Graph instance (?), the summaries are lost.
What is the recommended way of adding image summaries when using the Dataset API? I would like to request a comment / example on that in the official docs.
