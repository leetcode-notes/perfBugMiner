error in docs

The docs here  for bounding boxes  have an error :
The paragraph reading
For example, if an image is 100 x 200 pixels and the bounding box is [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9], the bottom-left and upper-right coordinates of the bounding box will be (10, 40) to (50, 180).
would better go something like:
For example, if an image is 100 x 200 pixels and the bounding box is [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9], the upper-left and bottom-right coordinates of the bounding box will be (10, 40) to (50, 180), using a somewhat idiosyncratic (y,x) notation, or (40,10) to (180,50) using the rather more common (x,y) notation for points in a plane. All this is with 'usual' coordinate axes (origin in the top left corner, increasing x to right and increasing y going down)
