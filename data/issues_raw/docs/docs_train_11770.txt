tf.contrib.data.Dataset filter documentation broken

With the old input pipeline functions, in tf.train.batch() you could specify the "allow_smaller_final_batch" parameter, which would allow or disallow a smaller final batch. With the new input pipeline functions in tf.contrib.data, the batch function allows a smaller final batch by default, and (to the best of my knowledge) there is no way to skip this last half-batch to ensure all batch sizes are equal.
Is there a possibility that a "allow_smaller_final_batch" flag could be added to the new batch function?
