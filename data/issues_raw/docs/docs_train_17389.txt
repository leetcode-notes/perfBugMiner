Describe the problem
The Python and C++ API Documentation links at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/api_docs/ silently redirect you to documentation for version 1.6. The links are (I assume) correct, but the URLs https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/api_docs/python and https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/api_docs/cc redirect to https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/ and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/ respectively.
I spent a while trying to diagnose a problem based on the documentation for 1.6, without realizing I was looking at 1.6 rather than 1.5. Turns out the problem was caused by an API change between 1.5 and 1.6.
