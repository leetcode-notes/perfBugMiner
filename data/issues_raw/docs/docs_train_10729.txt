tf.nn.max_pool wrong docs?

Describe the problem
API states that ksize has length >= 4, the size of window for each dimension of the input tensor. However, value is a 4-D Tensor so doesn't this mean that ksize should be length == 4? Same for strides.
Digging into maxpooling_op.cc shows that there's some check that does ==. Line 212:
    OP_REQUIRES(context, ksize_.size() == 4,
                errors::InvalidArgument("Sliding window ksize field must "
                                        "specify 4 dimensions"));
