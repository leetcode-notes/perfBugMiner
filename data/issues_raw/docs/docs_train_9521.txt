Documentation for tf.nn.ctc_* `label` argument is unclear

The documentation for the connectionist temporal classifiers is unclear for label argument.  Here is what exists currently:
labels: An int32 SparseTensor. labels.indices[i, :] == [b, t] means labels.values[i] stores the id for (batch b, time t). labels.values[i] must take on values in [0, num_labels). See core/ops/ctc_ops.cc for more details.

The only way I was able to figure it out is from Jerod's comment on this SO:
