Sample for report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom and RunOptions

This is a feature request.
Please add some example to the docs describing how to use report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom and other options of RunOptions
All I could find is this file:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/profiler/model_analyzer_test.py
But it is not obvious. For example, it contains:
from tensorflow.core.protobuf import config_pb2

and then
with session.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(c, options=config_pb2.RunOptions(
        report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom=True))

And more questions arise like: "What is config_pb2?" etc.
Thanks.
