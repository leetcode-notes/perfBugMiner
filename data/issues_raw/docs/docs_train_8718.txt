Incorrect reference for tf.learn in Linear Model tutorials

This page and this mentions tf.learn multiple times.
However, looking at the links and source code, I believe that tf.learn should actually be either tf.contrib or tf.contrib.learn, not tf.learn.
(I guess tf.learn was the old name, but got renamed but the tutorial is still outdated?)
