Missing images in docs

The page https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather has a broken link to an image: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/images/Gather.png
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scatter_add also has a broken link https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/images/ScatterAdd.png
In addition, the images seem to be missing from the tensorflow repo.  Could those be put in there? It is hard to build the docs locally for offline use without the images.
