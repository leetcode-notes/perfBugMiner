Profiling tools for open source TensorFlow

It would be very useful to understand which parts of the computational graph are causing computational bottlenecks.
This question has been asked on Stack Overflow here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34293714/tensorflow-can-i-measure-the-execution-time-of-individual-operations
and here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34629613/how-to-profile-tensorflow-networks
but it seems more appropriate as a feature request as this would allow systematic discussion. The TensorFlow white paper talks about very advanced internal tools that Google have along these lines. Something like that would make open source TensorFlow even better. I did it look at the road map but I'm not sure it explicitly mentioned this topic.
My apologies if I have missed a post about this.
