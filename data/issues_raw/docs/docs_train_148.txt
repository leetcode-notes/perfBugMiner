Wrong link in the "common problems" docs

On the "Getting started page" in the following part:
Common Problems
GPU-related issues

If you encounter the following when trying to run a TensorFlow program:

ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Make sure you followed the the GPU installation instructions.

The last word "instructions" leads to http://www.tensorflow.org/#install_cuda, however the main page it leads to does not have an anchor "install_cuda", so it just ends up leading to the top of main page.
Presumably, the correct link is http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.md#install_cuda
