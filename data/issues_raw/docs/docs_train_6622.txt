Minor doc issue - Param order in nce_loss in word2vec tutorial

In section 'Building the graph' of g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/index.md:
# Compute the NCE loss, using a sample of the negative labels each time.
loss = tf.reduce_mean(
  tf.nn.nce_loss(nce_weights, nce_biases, embed, train_labels,
                 num_sampled, vocabulary_size))
Whereas the actual order of parameters is, as in python/ops/nn_impl.py, is defined as:
def nce_loss(weights,
             biases,
             labels,
             inputs,
             ....
So the embed and the train_labels parameters in the code excerpt in the word2vec tutorial page should be swapped to match the definition of tf.nn.nce_loss().
