Documentation: broken links and image in documentation

The URL:  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_sum has a broken link labelled "the section on Segmentation".  Also, there is a broken image on that page as well.
Same problems here too (except not all have an image to be broken):
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_prod
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_min
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_mean
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/unsorted_segment_sum
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sum
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_mean
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sqrt_n
The page I believe they should link back to is here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation
I came here because I haven't grokked just what segmented operations are yet.  So I would be much obliged if the explanation of segmentation were more thoroughly be explained there, perhaps with a couple of examples.
I found [a few places] in the code where this could be address.  And I would have attempted a pull request to fix these, but I'm not up on how to generate the documentation to verify that it was fixed.
