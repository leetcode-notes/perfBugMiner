Image problems in Tensorflow documentation at tensorflow.org, Error 404

I'm not sure I should put the issue here. But when I clicked "Issue tracker" on tensorflow.org, it redirects me here.
I realized that the directory structure for TF documentation has changed a lot for TF 1.0 on http://www.tensorflow.org. Now there are problems for web pages with images, like https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max?hl=bn. A 404 error is reported while loading the images.
