tensorflow/example/mutilbox_detector bazel build error

I think there are lots of out of date docs in this repo, for example:
tensorflow/example/mutilbox_detector

this example show build mutilbox_detector using bazel and generate an binary executable file, however I just got bunch of errors:

Suggest develop team upgrade useless docs and fix those tutorial that makes us confuse and even lead us to the wrong road.....
