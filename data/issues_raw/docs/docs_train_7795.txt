Typo in "Validate Your Installation" document.

Partway down:

If you are new to TensorFlow, see [Getting Started with TensorFlow]Getting Started With TensorFlow.

Note the extraneous square brackets; looks like a markdown typo. Interestingly, the "Getting Started With" link still works (which did not survive my copy-paste into the issue tracker).
