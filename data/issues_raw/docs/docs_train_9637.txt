Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial problem

I am learning about Convolutional Neural Networks from the tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn
Inside it there is a link for getting the code but it is not working:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow_models/tutorials/image/cifar10/
how can I get the code?
