Broken class hierarchy in sample code in getting started tutorial.

The last example in https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started does not work. When run it gives the following error message:
<ipython-input-65-6c74aa534fa7> in model(features, labels, mode, params)
     18     # ModelFnOps connects subgraphs we built to the
     19     # appropriate functionality.
---> 20     return tf.contrib.learn.estimators.model_fn.ModelFnOps(
     21         mode=mode, predictions=y,
     22         loss= loss,

AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.learn' has no attribute 'estimators'

This comes from this line:
return tf.contrib.learn.estimators.model_fn.ModelFnOps(
        mode=mode, predictions=y,
        loss= loss,
        train_op=train)

There is a ModelFnOps in tf.contrib.learn and when using that the code at least runs. The result, though, seems to differ from what is mentioned in the doc.
tf.VERSION is 1.0.0.
