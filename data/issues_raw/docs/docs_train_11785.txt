proposed new github for tensorflow notebooks

I would like to propose that we make a separate repository in github for jupyter notebooks.
I think it should be separate from the main tensorflow github so that people can check it out without having to check out all of tensorflow.
I've created such a github and will work on it by myself for now but I think eventually there should be something more official or at least maybe what I have can be considered official enough to have pointers to it from the main tensorflow github.
