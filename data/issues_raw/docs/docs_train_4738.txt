Feature Request: Include function argument defaults in the documentation

I have recently started using functions from tf.contrib. They speed things up a lot. Thank you.
I did notice that some of the prototypes in the documents have their arguments replaced with (*args, **kwargs). See tf.contrib.layers: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/contrib.layers.html#layers-contrib. Perhaps this is automatically done if the number of arguments exceeds some number. Unfortunately the prototype is the only place where the argument defaults are shown. I have been looking at the source file, layers.py, to see the full prototype for the defaults which is fine, but probably not idea.
My request is to include the argument defaults somewhere in the documentation. I wouldn't mind long prototypes, i.e. getting rid of the (*args, **kwargs). Or if people want the shorter prototypes, maybe the argument defaults could be automatically included somewhere in the description.
