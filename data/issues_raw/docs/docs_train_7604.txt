the use of MultiRNNCell?

doc is in https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent
I found the line
stacked_lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([lstm] * number_of_layers,
I need to use MultiRNNCell
but,I write those lines
a = [tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(10)]*3
print id(a[0]), id(a[1])
Its output is 4648063696 4648063696
can MultiRNNCell use the same object BasicLSTMCell as a list for parameter?
