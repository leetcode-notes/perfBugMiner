`from tensorflow.g3doc...` is Broken

There are a dozen places in g3doc/how_tos and g3doc/tutorials where things are imported from the g3doc directory.
The g3doc directory isn't included in the installation, and tensorflow, intentionally, can't be imported from the source directory, so those are likely all broken.
