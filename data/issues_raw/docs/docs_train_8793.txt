python StagingArea documentation missing

StagingArea (and perhaps other structures in data_flow_ops.py) are not present in the python documentation. They are however mentioned in the 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 release notes
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
A search of the docs for "StagingArea" doesn't reveal any of the docstrings present in data_flow_ops.py.
Stage and Unstage are present in the C++ documentation.
