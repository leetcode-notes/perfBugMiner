Fix tf.argmax/argmin documentation

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/argmax

The documentation does not explain what an "index" is. I can imagine a billion definitions of "index". Is it the same as the "index" in tf.one_hot?
The documentation does not explain what happens if axis is set to None.
"For vectors, use axis = 0.": Why?
The documentation should clearly explain how the rank+shape of the returned tensor correlates with the rank+shape of the input tensor.
The documentation incorrectly indicates that there is a guide if you click "See the guide", but it takes you to a function reference/index. A redundant 3 sentence description is not a "guide".
