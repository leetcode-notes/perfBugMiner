Change TanhGrad() operation definition with respect to documentation

Hello,
TanhGrad() documentation says: "Specifically, grad = dy * (1 - y*y), where y = tanh(x), and dy
is the corresponding input gradient." 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc
    
    
         Line 323
      in
      bab2db4
    
    
    
    

        
          
           Specifically, `grad = dy * (1 - y*y)`, where `y = tanh(x)`, and `dy` 
        
    
  

 which is correct and looks good.
But operation has following declaration of inputs:
Input("x: T")
.Input("y: T")

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc
    
    
         Line 200
      in
      bab2db4
    
    
    
    

        
          
           Input("x: T")                                                \ 
        
    
  


what doesn't correlate with the documentated formula: grad = dy * (1 - y*y).
Could you please rename inputs with respect to documentation like this:
Input("y: T")
.Input("dy: T")
Thanks.
