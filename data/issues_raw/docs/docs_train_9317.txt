Explain what tf.nn.softplus does to integers

tf.nn.softplus computes log(1 + exp(x)).  Naively, I wouldn't expect this to work for integers, but it does.  On integers, it seems to degenerate to a poorly named version of tf.relu: it computes max(0, x).
We probably can't eliminate the integer versions for backward compatibility reasons, but we should at least explain what they do.
