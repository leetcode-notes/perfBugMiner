Outdated documentation of Assert op

From https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/control_flow_ops/debugging_operations#Assert
 # Ensure maximum element of x is smaller or equal to 1
assert_op = tf.Assert(tf.less_equal(tf.reduce_max(x), 1.), [x])
x = tf.with_dependencies([assert_op], x)

tf.with_dependencies does not exist (see also a related stack overflow discussion)
