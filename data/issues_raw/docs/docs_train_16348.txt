Change RELEASE.md to specify CUDA version

The RELEASE.md states that "Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7."
#15604 says that CUDA 9.1 is not supported.
Could we change the RELEASE.md so that it says "Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7." until later versions are supported?
