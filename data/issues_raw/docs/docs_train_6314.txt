Error 404 when downloading Tensorflow on Windows

The links provided on the website to the .whl used to install Tensorflow on Windows seem to be broken : https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows
I'm getting an HTTP Error 404.
I found the CPU Build elsewhere but I can't find the GPU build which I would like tu use.
