Could contens on tensorflow.org be mirrored on github or other places other than google server?

I am from China, and I cannot open the tensorflow.org web site. As known to all, google services are not available in China because the Firewall. It would be very helpful if the documents and turoirals can be obtained from other places other than google server. Sorry to bother. Thanks!
