where is Tensorflow directory on Windows ?

I have installed and verified Tensorflow installation on Windows, that's great. But how I am supposed to to stuff like pyhthon3 cifar10_train.py? ran that command got error no such file or directory. Also run the whole code in cifar10.py and got error there is no module named tensorflow.modles.
ImportError was unhandled by user code Message: No module named 'tensorflow.models'
