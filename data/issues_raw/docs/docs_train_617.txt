Docs for tf.device should point to tf.Graph.device

Currently the docs for tf.device located here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#device
point to tf.Graph.name_scope() for more details, when it would be a lot more helpful if they pointed instead to tf.Graph.device(), i.e. here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#Graph.device
This would be more consistent with the rest of the docs as well.
