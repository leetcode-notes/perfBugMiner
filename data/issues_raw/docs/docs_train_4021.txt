Improving Google Indexing for the Documentation

Whenever I run a Google search on a TensorFlow functionality, say, tf.reshape, it gives me the entire documentation, not the specific documentation related to that functionality.
Currently the way I use is  to run a search with ctrl + f to find specific documentation related to what I search for.
Numpy has that property, i.e. when you run a Google search on np.reshape, you get the specific page.
It would be a nice improvement for the documentation if someone fixes the Google indexing for the documentation page, especially for the users who frequently use Google search for the documentation.
