tf.train.Scaffold missing global_step attribute

According to the docstring of tf.train.Scaffold, there is a global_step attribute with the following description:

global_step: A tensor containing the global step counter.  Picked
from and stored into the GLOBAL_STEP collection in the graph by default.

             * `global_step`: A tensor containing the global step counter.  Picked 
        
    
  

)
The problem is that no such attribute actually exists.
