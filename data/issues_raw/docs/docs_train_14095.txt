Describe the problem
The docstring of matrix_triangular_solve is not clear, see https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/matrix_triangular_solve. There are formatting issues, but moreover, it is not immediately clear what the effect of adjoint=True is. It would be helpful to describe the effect using linear algebra notation.
