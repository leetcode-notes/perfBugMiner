Unclear documentation for tf.layers.dense flattening behavior

Documentation states:

Note: if the inputs tensor has a rank greater than 2, then it is
flattened prior to the initial matrix multiply by w.

However, the following returns tensor with shape shape=(2, 2, 2, 400), as if the input has not been flattened
tf.layers.dense(tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (2,2,2,2)), 400)
