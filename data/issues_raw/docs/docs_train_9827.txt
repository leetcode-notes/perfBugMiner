tf.abs() isn't documented to handle complex, but it does appear to work as tf.complex_abs() used to.

Issue #7405 was a bug filed that tf.complex_abs() was removed in 1.0.  At the bottom it says that tf.abs() now does that work, but the docs for tf.abs() only mention float.  I confirmed that tf.abs() does in fact do as the comment on the issue describes (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py#L225)
Please incorporate the info from https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/math_ops/complex_number_functions#complex_abs
into
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/abs
... specifically the parts about it computing sqrt(a^2 + b^2) for complex numbers.
