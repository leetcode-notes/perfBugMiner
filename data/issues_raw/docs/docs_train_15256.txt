Problem about tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Win10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4
Python version: 3.52
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0,6.46
GPU model and memory:2GB
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I used the tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices to built a dataset. But the website has no enought information.
Here's my code
point_cloud_feature_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices(sparse_feature) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size = 100000) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.batch(batch_size = BATCH_SIZE) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.repeat() iterator_feature = point_cloud_feature_dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
when I called the iterator_feature.get_nest(). It return 3 Tensors of shape [none,none,1]. Instead of a SparseTensor.  The input Sparse Tensor of dataset has a shape of [1000000,300000]. Each row is a example. I hope talents can replenish the Doc. Thanks!!
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
