The function 'layers/convolutional.py` does not follow `tf.GraphKeys` convention

In convolutional.py bias and weight variables are created and named kernel and bias. However according to the conventions defined in tf.GraphKeys.md those variables should be named  weights and biases and assigned the corresponding collections. There is some (third party) functionality which utilizes this convention, including tf.contrib.layers.summarize_weights.
In addition, the names to be used are also stored in the constants tf.GraphKeys.WEIGHTS and tf.GraphKeys.BIASES. So instead of writing the strings hard in the code, I would suggest utilizing those constants. Do you agree with that? I am happy to submit a pull request solving this issue, if desired.
