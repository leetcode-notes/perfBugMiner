Describe the problem
Native TensorRT support in TensorFlow was announced by both Google  and Nvidia blog posts last week. But tf.contrib.tensorrt is missing from the Python API list. Currently, the only documentation is on readme file in the  tensorflow/contrib/tensorrt repository. But it doesn't given details about using the API.  Please include documentation for this important feature.
