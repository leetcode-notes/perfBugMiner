Documentation on how reusable variables sync between CPU and GPU

I haven't been able to find anything online that documents how the sync of reusable variables happens between CPU and GPU. Specifically, I'm interested in if a CPU pinned variable is used multiple times in a GPU computation without being updated, does it sync only once (i.e. use a dirty flag), or will it try sync again each time?
