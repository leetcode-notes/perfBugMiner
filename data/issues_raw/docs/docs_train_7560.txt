tar: Unrecognized archive format error when trying to unpack flower_photos.tgz, TF tutorials on OSX

This is relating to the
How to Retrain Inception's Final Layer for New Categories Tutorial
I'm trying to unpack the flower_photos.tgz after curling it using
curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_../images/flower_photos.tgz
tar xzf flower_photos.tgz

This is from the image retraining tutorial for TensorFlow
Results from curling

Then when I try to unpack
tar xzf flower_photos.tgz
tar: Unrecognized archive format
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.
