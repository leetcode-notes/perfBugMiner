example_trainer c++ improvements

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/cc/tutorials/example_trainer.cc
First of all, why only one c++ tutorial?
Next, it would be nice to have a README in that folder that gives at least the bazel command to compile it, or at least a note at the top of the source code how to compile it.
example_trainer.cc shows off how to use multiple threads, but i would rather start with a single threaded version for a simple helloworld tutorial.
lines 43-46 ugly macros TF_DEFINE_int32, ... when i first saw this it is not clear why this is even required, or how it is used later on.
lines 155-159 the ugly macro injects FLAGS_ prefix
opts.num_concurrent_steps = tensorflow::example::FLAGS_num_concurrent_steps;
the option settings could be just simple hard coded literals, there is no need to complicate the hello world with macro magic.
