tf.layers.Network is in the documentation, but not the library

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): OS X 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source, latest 1.4 branch
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-rc1-12-gd752244fba 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.38)
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

see below
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
The 1.4 version of the documentation mentions tf.layers.Network in its examples of using the new function based layers (here is a link to the specific doc, https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/Input), so all you have to do is copy/paste the example code and run it.
Source code / logs
the most basic code to verify is
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.layers.Network)

on my system this results in
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.layers.layers' has no attribute 'Network'
