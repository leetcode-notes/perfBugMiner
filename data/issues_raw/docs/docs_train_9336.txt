tflearn Incorrect Comment

In the tflearn quick start guide here:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/tflearn.md
Below the section "Describe the training input pipeline {#train-input}"
The first snippet:
# Define the test inputs
def get_train_inputs():
  x = tf.constant(training_set.data)
  y = tf.constant(training_set.target)

  return x, y
Should be
# Define the training inputs
def get_train_inputs():
  x = tf.constant(training_set.data)
  y = tf.constant(training_set.target)

  return x, y
where
# Define the test inputs -> # Define the training inputs
In the overall listing at the top of this file, it appears to have the correct comment. It's just here in this section where the comment is incorrect.
