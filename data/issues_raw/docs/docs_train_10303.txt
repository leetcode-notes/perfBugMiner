TensorflowDebugger does not dump Stack/Pack/Concat nodes

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0/5.1.5
GPU model and memory:
Titan X Pascal
Exact command to reproduce:

import sys
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python import debug as tf_debug

base = tf.ones([10], dtype=tf.float32, name='base')
stacked = tf.stack([base, base], name='stacked')
concat = tf.concat([[base], [base]], axis=0, name='concat')

session = tf.Session()
session = tf_debug.LocalCLIDebugWrapperSession(session)

with session.as_default():
    res = session.run([ stacked, concat])
print res

Describe the problem
When using the TensorflowDebugger with stacked/concated, the stacked/concated nodes do not appear in the set of dumped nodes once a run has completed.  In addition nodes that fed into these nodes are not dumped.
