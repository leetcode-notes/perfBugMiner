No documentation for ConfigProto

System information
Not necessary in this case.
Describe the problem
No documentation for the ConfigProto class in the TF website. Specifically, in neither of the following pages

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/ConfigProto
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/api_docs/python/tf/ConfigProto
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/ConfigProto

Possible solutions
The following article https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/using_gpu contains info about ConfigProto. Either the docs for ConfigProto can be written based on that info or, at least, a link to that article should be added to the ConfigProto docs.
