Documentation for tf.strided_slice is nearly useless

The documentation for this op could almost be used as a teaching moment for how to not document something.  In order to understand what it does, it is necessary to not only understand in detail how the related numpy op works, but also understand the mapping between the inputs of that op and the inputs of theTensorFlow op, that are totally different -- something that is far from obvious.
Just to ice the cake, the examples given in the document are for slice, not strided_slice...
Searches didn't turn up anything.  TF version is .11.  The machine and OS are not applicable.
