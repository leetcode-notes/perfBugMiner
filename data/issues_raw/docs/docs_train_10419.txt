[Feature Request] A guide for creating custom DeepDream models

The current DeepDream guide located here, uses the inception5h model. From what I can tell, it does not appear very straightforward in terms of how to fine tune the model in order to create different DeepDream hallucinations from a custom data set. It also does not appear to be relatively easy to change the model that the guide uses.
I think that an additional guide which shows individuals how to fine tune a model for the purposes of DeepDream would be useful for those trying to explore the artistic and visual aspects of TensorFlow models. I haven't been able to find any guide for creating custom DeepDream models in Tensorflow, so I am not sure where to start.
