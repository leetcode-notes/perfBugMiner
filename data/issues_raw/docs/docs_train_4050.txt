Possible improvement in documentation

I'm following the documentation here. Specifically, I find that running the second command in the code block of the section "Compiling the kernel for the GPU device" returns a linker error complaining about the lack of the lcudart library. I have solved this issue by adding the option -L /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64/ to the command, since the libcudart.so library is located in that folder on my machine. I'm not sure how else this library would be located (LD_LIBRARY_PATH is only searched on execution, not compile-time), so I'm thinking this problem might not be specific to my configuration. If so, adding mention of this option on the documentation might be valuable.
