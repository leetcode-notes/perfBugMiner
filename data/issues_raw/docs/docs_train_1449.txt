Need better doc about the difference between name scope and variable scope in tensorflow and What's the context manager?(Soved))

Hi,
Although stack overflow have a question about this, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34215746/difference-between-variable-scope-and-name-scope-in-tensorflow. But right now the answers are not so clear and the doc also not tell the difference too, but I believe understanding the difference between name scope and variable scope and context manager is beneficial to programming for newbie using tensorflow.
