tf.pad docstring is missing description of the "mode" argument

The docstring gives examples of using "CONSTANT", "REFLECT" and "SYMMETRIC" modes, but never describes what they actually are.
For example:

What value is used to pad in constant mode? (The answer is 0.)
What exactly is the difference between REFLECT and SYMMETRIC? (I don't know.)
