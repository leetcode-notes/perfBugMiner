Method docs contain unclosed verbatim, which causes exceeding verbatim block in HTML docs

The HTML docs for tf.constant_initializer at  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/state_ops.html#constant_initializer contain unclosed verbatim block, which continues past the method and contains several following methods -- see for example the tf.random_normal_initializer.
I am not much familiar with the process of documentation generation, but my guess is that the verbatim ending block at 
  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py
    
    
         Line 142
      in
      2c4af2e
    
    
    
    

        
          
               ``` 
        
    
  

 has wrong indentation (it is indented by two more spaces than the start of the block).
