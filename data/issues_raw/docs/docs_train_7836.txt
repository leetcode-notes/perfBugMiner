Breaking changes to API

tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss and tf.nn.nce_loss have both changed their API such that you need to switch the inputs, labels to labels, inputs parameters. You might want to put a note here (under breaking changes): https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md
Incase you want to check here is the API of the two versions of tf:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/nce_loss
Although I do find it odd that tf would simply change the order of these inputs.
