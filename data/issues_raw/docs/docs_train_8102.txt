Scatter_nd doc not clear about concurrent updates

The doc on the scatter_nd does not specify the consequence of multiple updates that reference the same location.
I've tested this using the following code:
indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1], [1]])
updates = tf.constant([9, 10, 11, 12])
shape = tf.constant([8])
scatter = tf.scatter_nd(indices, updates, shape)
with tf.Session() as sess:
  print sess.run(scatter)
The resulting tensor is:
[0, 23, 0, 10, 9, 0, 0, 0]
So it seems the updates are added. Is this the intended usage? If so, it would be great to clarify this in the docs.
Thanks!
