Update tensorboard development instructions

I want to be able to run tensorboard in development mode and make some changes.
from the DEVELOPMENT document:

bazel run third_party/tensorflow/tensorboard/components/tf_tensorboard:demo

but this command seems to be obsolete from the directory structure (there is no target inside /third_party).
also seems there is a .idea folder committed in the repository.
Would be nice to know how the core team setups their environment.
