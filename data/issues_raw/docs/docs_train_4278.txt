Minor documentation / code mismatch in Optimizer

The Optimizer class has the following method:
  def _valid_dtypes(self):
    """Valid types for loss, variables and gradients.
    Defaults to `float32`. Subclasses should override to allow other types.
    Returns:
      Valid types for loss, variables and gradients.
    """
    return set([dtypes.float16, dtypes.float32, dtypes.float64])
The docstring says that _valid_dtypes defaults only to float32, but the code also allows float16 and float64. The docstring should be updated to reflect that the default allowed set includes these other float types.
