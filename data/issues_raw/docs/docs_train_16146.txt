Documentation for GridLSTMCell is lacking and does not match the paper

Describe the problem
The documentation for tf.contrib.rnn.GridLSTMCell cites the paper "Grid Long Short-Term Memory", by Kalchbrenner et al.
The paper describes an architecture, called the 2D Grid LSTM, to replace a stack of LSTM cells. In a 2D Grid LSTM, 2 state components are passed from one layer to the next vertically.
In Tensorflow RNN parlance, one would expect both the state and the output of the cell to be an LSTMStateTuple, which would allow seamless integration with a MultiRNNCell.
In the current implementation, instead it appears that the vertical unrolling is done internally to the GridLSTMCell.
I say it appears, because I can't quite make sense of the arguments and their documentation: specifically, there is a required "num_frequency_block" argument whose meaning is quite obscure.
Looking at the implementation also did not help me understand what value is actually expected in that parameter, and the related parameters.
Note that the above mentioned paper does not talk about frequencies anywhere.
Would it be possible to expand on the documentation for the cell, as well as provide a code example on how to replicate the 2D Grid LSTM from the paper?
