Sticky  "No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Conv2D' with these attrs."

There are two issues here:
1: tf.nn.conv2d does not support float64 tensors on CPU although the documentation states it should
2: after the first occurrence of the situation above, tf.nn.conv2d keeps crashing with the same error even when we provide float32 tensors.

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
# issue 1: this never works although the documentation states that it should
