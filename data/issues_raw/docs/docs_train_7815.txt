tf r1.0 strided_slice documentation

In the docs, the following sentences seem incomplete/incoherent:


If the ith bit of ellipsis_mask [is-set-to-something], as many unspecified dimensions as needed will be inserted between other dimensions. Only one non-zero bit is allowed in ellipsis_mask.


If the ith bit of new_axis_mask is one, then a? begin, end, and stride are ignored and a new length 1 dimension is added at this point in the output tensor
