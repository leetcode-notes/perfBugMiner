Full-fledged Java api roadmap?

Are there any estimated plans for Java api development in terms of functionality ? The only absolute choice for Java language nowadays is Deeplearning4j, any plans to occupy a niche for Java language?
By the term "full-fledged" I mean: constructing a graph from scratch (including most common math function/operations, respectively), train CNN, test CNN, recognize the result, all of this using Java language only.
#14094 and #16120 is still in work and latter frozen for a few days. Just want to know your vision of future.
P.s. need to choose right framework for starting a project at the end of June.
