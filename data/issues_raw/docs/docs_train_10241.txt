C++ Online Documentation codeblocks not formatting

There are some codeblocks in C++ documentation , written with github-style fenced markdown,
that are not rendering as <code>.
Eg: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space

It looks like something is going wrong with the site generation,
that when translating markdown, it does not pickup these blocks.
In the pages I quickly checked it seems to occur in the Summary sections, eg in:

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/batch-to-space
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/batch-to-space-n-d
