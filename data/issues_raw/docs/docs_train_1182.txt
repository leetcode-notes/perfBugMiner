Small bug in TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning tutorial [FIXED, pending website pushes]

There is a small bug in the code on the site: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10], name='bias'))
should be:
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name='bias')
The consequence is that when you view the graph, the 'bias' variable has no useful label and is simply Variable.
