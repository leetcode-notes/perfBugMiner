Add a bit more descriptions on adding an op?

Hi,
I'm trying to add my custom op and feeling that the document doesn't give enough information on how it works. I struggled a lot and finally I'm able to figure things out by reading the code of some header files.
Can anyone take a look if the changes to the document in this PR will make it better for new people?
