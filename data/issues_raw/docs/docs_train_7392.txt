docs: Broken link/missing py file in Model Files guide

On the page "A Tool Developer's Guide to TensorFlow Model Files"
(GitHub md link)
In the GraphDef section, there's a link to graph_metrics.py, pointing to the url https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py
This url does not exist. Perhaps it's intended to point at a different file in that folder? I don't see an obvious suitable replacement from scanning the filenames listed: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/tools
