Wrong example script in the docs for preprocessing data

I was reading the docs for preprocessing, which is a small paragraph linking to the CIFAR-10 network as an example. However, that script does not perform any preprocessing. Do we have a better example illustrating preprocessing steps like data normalization, distorting images, etc?
