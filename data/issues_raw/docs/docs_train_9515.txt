How do you generate tensorflow docs so you can confirm documentation fixes you make?

Example: Suppose I see a formatting error in a Tensorflow function's arguments on the web. I then make a change in the "Args: ..." section of the function's python comments.
How can I generate these html docs after making this fix?
