Some wrong code in get_started document

On your get started website http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage.html#basic-usage
I found a small piece of wrong code:
In the sample code of Feeds section:
input1 = tf.placeholder(tf.types.float32)
input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.types.float32)

I tried them and python gave the AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'types'
After reading the document http://www.tensorflow.org/resources/dims_types.html
I think it should be tf.float32 instead of tf.types.float32.  Probably it's a version issue?
