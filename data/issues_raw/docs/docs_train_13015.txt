Ubuntu installation instruction is too obsolete!

For successful build on Ubuntu it's required to do much more than stated on the installation instructions!
My system:
CUDA support: YES
Bazel: 0.5.4
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.1-8ubuntu1) 5.4.1 20170304
Linux Desktop 4.10.0-33-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 11 10:55:28 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
CPU i7-7820x (with AVX512 support)

It's required change the build command:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --cxxopt="-fabi-version=0" //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures
And it's still not enough :( I still can't make successful build...
