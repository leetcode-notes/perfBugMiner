Format Error on the Website

Hi, on tensorflow.org there is part of documentation accidentally formatted into code. It's not a serious problem.  It's about initializer on r0.11. I didn't check if other versions have the same problem. Just  want to post it here for your information.

link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/state_ops.html#random_normal_initializer (this actually won't lead you right to the location because of the error ).
