Improved documentation for TensorArray

The current documentation for TensorArray could use an expanded introduction explaining its utility and main motivation, examples of actual usage, and further explanation of some of its methods. The docs here do not have a single usage example. The overall description of the section is just:
"This class is meant to be used with dynamic iteration primitives such as while_loop and map_fn. It supports gradient back-propagation via special "flow" control flow dependencies."
How is meant to be used with dynamic iteration primitives? What does that entail and why do we need a special construct for dynamic iteration? And what is "flow"? It's very cryptic as it stands. Furthermore, some methods are very poorly described, like close. It's unclear if it needs to be invoked at the end, or what? Comments on stack overflow only add to the confusion. With the increasing importance of dynamic graphs, a basic construct like TensorArray should really be well documented, like Variable.
