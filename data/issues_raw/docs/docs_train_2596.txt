Udacity readme docker command should not remove container

The Udacity readme at
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/README.md
suggests starting Docker like this:
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm b.gcr.io/tensorflow-udacity/assignments:0.5.0
The --rm causes the container to get removed once you end the session, which deletes all your progress so far in the class. It would be better to not suggest --rm so that the docker container can then be resumed at a later time.
