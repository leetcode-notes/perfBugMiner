TensorFlow processes and core engine documentations

Hi all,
I am interesting to understand more details about TF core engine. My focus interest on how a process create and launch when session is being created. Also, how the threads work and how python api translate these threads to C++ TF engine. Is there any documentation about that ?
Sincerely
