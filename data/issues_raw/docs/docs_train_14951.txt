Document S3 `S3_REGION` constant

This gave me a lot of grief recently as the AWS Region for S3 is controlled by an undocumented constant S3_REGION which defaults to us-east-1 unless defined on the system-level. Extra frustrating as it departs from the common naming practice: AWS_REGION:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/s3/s3_file_system.cc
    
    
         Line 52
      in
      79422ab
    
    
    
    

        
          
           const char* region = getenv("S3_REGION"); 
        
    
  


If somebody could suggest where to document this, I'd be happy to contribute.
