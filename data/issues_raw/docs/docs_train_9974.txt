Describe the problem
Is it just me or is there quite a large disconnect between the two versions of Estimator. The tutorial in the docs guides you through the contrib version but I understand that it has also been moved to tf.Estimator? However in the docs it appears that almost all functionality, e.g. canned estimators or .fit() appears to be missing or altered and there is little documentation to explain this new API.
Have I misunderstood something here? I imagine that we are preferred to use tf.estimator because using the contrib version kicks up all sorts of warning about how it will be deprecated last year! Although the estimator tutorial still uses it and also .fit() which I can't clearly see the replacement for in the new API. Is there going to be any example code or tutorial for the new tf.Estimator API as I feel it desperately needs it. The contrib version was difficult enough to understand that I gave up but want to try again! Thanks
