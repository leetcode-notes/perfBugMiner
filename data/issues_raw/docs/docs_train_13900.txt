tfdbg doesn't work with tensorflow GPU version?

Could the dear developers confirm that tfdbg works with tensorflow GPU version or not?
At least on my platform it doesn't work.
OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 7.3 (Maipo)
Python: Python 2.7.5
tensorflow (1.4.0rc0) (compiled from source with CUDA enabled, CUDA 8.0.61, cuDNN8-7.0.1)
nVidia Quadro P5000
the code for reproducing the problem is as follows:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow.python import debug as tf_debug

t = tf.constant(np.ones((10, 16)), tf.float32)

def weight_variable(shape):
    initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev = 0.1)
    return tf.Variable(initial)

def bias_variable(shape):
    initial = tf.constant(0., shape = shape)
    return tf.Variable(initial)

lin1_output_size = 32
lin2_output_size = 1

with tf.name_scope("lin1"):
    weight_shape = t.get_shape().as_list()[1:] + [lin1_output_size]
    lin1_output = tf.matmul(t, weight_variable(weight_shape)) + bias_variable([lin1_output_size])

with tf.name_scope("lin2"):
    weight_shape = [lin1_output_size, lin2_output_size]
    lin2_output = tf.matmul(lin1_output, weight_variable(weight_shape)) + bias_variable([lin2_output_size])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    sess = tf_debug.LocalCLIDebugWrapperSession(sess)

    print(sess.run(lin2_output))


The phenomenon is after invoking stepper and steps for several steps, it is reporting segmentation fault and exit.
I just wonder is it due to GPU issue?
