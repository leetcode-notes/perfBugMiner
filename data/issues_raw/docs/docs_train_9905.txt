Wrong hyperlink in web page tutorial

There is a wrong html link in text in the tutorial "Vector Representations of Words" at address https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec
The text is in the first paragraph after the bullet points in the Highlights section at the top of the page.
The link for:
tensorflow_models/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py
https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow_models/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py
is wrong, it should point to the following address:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py
I hope that this is helpful.
