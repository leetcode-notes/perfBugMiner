installation failed with Virtualenv ERROR:The executable is not functioning tensorflow

Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
The version of virtualenv is 15.1.0
issue like these:
admindeMacBook-Air:~ admin$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow
Using base prefix '//anaconda'
New python executable in /Users/admin/tensorflow/bin/python
dyld: Library not loaded: @loader_path/../lib/libpython3.5m.dylib
Referenced from: /Users/admin/tensorflow/bin/python
Reason: image not found
ERROR: The executable /Users/admin/tensorflow/bin/python is not functioning
ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is '/Users/admin' (should be '/Users/admin/tensorflow')
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable
I have tried many ways like homebrew, upgrade py, but it does not work at all.
