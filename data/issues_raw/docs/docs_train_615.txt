please share a total example from training in python and prediction in C++.

Hi, TFs
Current I'm trying prediction in C++ following the tutorial in tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/image_recognition/index.md.
I want to train the mode in python, using interface tf.train.write_graph() to write the graph to a file, and then loading it in the C++ for predition, just like the above tutorial. Because there is no python codes in the tutorial and no guides to create the file of "tensorflow_inception_graph.pb".
I've tried several times, but failed. Could you share a total example in both sides in pyhton and c++?
