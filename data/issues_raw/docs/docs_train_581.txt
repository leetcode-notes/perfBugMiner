EXERCISE: The model architecture in inference() differs slightly from the CIFAR-10 model specified in cuda-convnet. In particular, the top layers of Alexâ€™s original model are locally connected and not fully connected. Try editing the architecture to exactly reproduce the locally connected architecture in the top layer.

When I look at the Figure2 of AlexNet paper, it seems that the only locally connected layers are conv1 and conv3 (which I would classify as "bottom" layers), both fully connected layers (which are "top" layers in my understanding) are connected across the two GPUs. Or am I not understanding the exercise correctly?
