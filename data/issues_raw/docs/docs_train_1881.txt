Update website with correct Cuda info

I received this on twitter:
"Can you please help update TF website to state TF-GPU needs nvidia compute cap. >= 3.5 and to install cudNN v4 (not 5). Thanks"

I'm not using Cuda myself, so I'm not sure of the details here, but wanted to get it logged so somebody more knowledgeable can take a look.
