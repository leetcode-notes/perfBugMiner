Confusing embedding_lookup docstring, incorrect use of the word "partition"

The wording in the docstring for nn.embedding_lookup is confusing and refers to subsets as partitions (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/api_docs/python/nn.html#embedding_lookup)
A partition of a set X is a set of nonempty subsets of X such that every element x in X is in exactly one of these subsets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set)
Here is an example of incorrect usage:
"For instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as: [[0, 5, 10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]"
That is actually 1 partition of the 13 ids, not 5 partitions.
And this is just really confusing:
"If len(params) > 1, each element id of ids is partitioned between the elements of params according to the partition_strategy. In all strategies, if the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the first (max_id + 1) % len(params) partitions will be assigned one more id."
