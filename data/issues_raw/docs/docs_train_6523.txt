possible variable typo in "Vector Representations of Words" documentation

The variables "training_inputs" and "training_labels" in the section "https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec/#training_the_model":
for inputs, labels in generate_batch(...):
  feed_dict = {training_inputs: inputs, training_labels: labels}
  _, cur_loss = session.run([optimizer, loss], feed_dict=feed_dict)

appear to be new per the tutorial text.
Were they supposed to be the previously defined "train_inputs" and "train_labels"?
thanks,
