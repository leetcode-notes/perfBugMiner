There is a learning_rate parameter in the Adadelta implementation although there isn't such one in the original paper

Hi,
I see in the documentation that tf.train.AdadeltaOptimizer has a learning_rate parameter, but in the original paper that parameter was eliminated from the update rule see equation 14 in the paper (or step 5 in the pseudo code of the algorithm).
Is that a bug in the implementation?
If you deliberately add a learning_rate parameter, I think that the API documentation should state explicitly that this is NOT the exact implementation of the algorithm as in the paper.
