Tensorflow cannot be installed with default Windows Python 3.5 stack

After installing Python 3.5.0 using the Windows 64 bit installer (which includes pip in the install):
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
Collecting tensorflow
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for tensorflow
You are using pip version 7.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
I tried on a different machine that worked, and found the only difference to be the pip version.  Updating to pip 9.0.1 solved the issue.
It's not explicitly stated anywhere that you need a newer version of pip.  When an old version of something is required to run something, people tend to ignore the messages indicating there is a newer version of it because that's exactly what they are expecting: "yeah I know there's a newer version, I meant to do this".
If this cannot be resolved for older version of pip (specifically, versions included with the required Python versions), could you please state this in the documentation.
