tf.contrib.learn output shapes : shapes (?, 1) and (?,) are incompatible

I tried to train a binary DNNClassifier  similar as the example on https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/tflearn/index.html#tf-contrib-learn-quickstart.
I got the following traceback

I explored the tensorflow source code and found that it may relate to _get_in_out_shape function in tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/learn_io/data_feeder.py

When doing a binary classification,y_shape is something like[batch_size,1].Line 52 changes it into [1].Line 54,55 change it into [].And finally the output_shape is [batch_size,].However the correct ouput shape should be [batch_size,1].
To sum up,we do not need to skip 1st dimension if it is 1 and len(y_shape)=1.
