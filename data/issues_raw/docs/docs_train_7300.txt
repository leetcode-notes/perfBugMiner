API documentation "Core graph data structures"

A few things are wrong in the documentation around https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/framework.md#tfgraphadd_to_collectionname-value-graphadd_to_collection.

Near the end of tf.Graph.name_scope, the line about ValueError is incomplete.
The paragraph at the very end of tf.Graph.name_scope should be in tf.Graph.add_to_collection.
Both tf.Graph.add_to_collection and tf.Graph.add_to_collections (plural) exist.
