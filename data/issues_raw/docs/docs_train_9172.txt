Describe the problem clearly
In my experience, this function tf.contrib.framework.load_variable returns a numpy.ndarray instead of a Tensor as the doc suggests. Furthermore according to the unit test, it is expected to return the value of a tensor instead of a Tensor object itself. I think the behavior of returning tensor values is desired (to load select variables from arbitrary checkpoints without a session), so this should be a minor doc issue.
