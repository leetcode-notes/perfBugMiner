Documentation pages are unnecessarily large

curl https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/abs | wc -c  # 1841844 (1.8MB)

Each page in the documentation now contains a HUGE left navbar contributing over 99% of the size.

This would waste a lot of network traffic on loading identical navbar over and over again.
It creates a big trouble when I tried to build an offline version of the doc. The whole html documents used to be <100MB, now they are 2.5GB.
