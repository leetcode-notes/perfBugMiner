Is batch_norm_param argument missing in the depthwise convolution 2d layer implementation?

This is with reference to: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py#L1850
The line says "if batch_norm_params is None" but there is no batch_norm_params argument included in the function, and it doesn't seem that batch_norm is implemented within the function as an option. Is the batch_norm function included in the regularizer function or has it not been implemented by default within the function?
Thanks for your help.
