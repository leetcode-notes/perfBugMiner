Document "How to adding new customized file system"

Adding customized file system is supported but not well documented:
TF_INC=$(python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.sysconfig.get_include())')
g++ -std=c++11 -shared test_file_system.cc -o test_file_system.so -fPIC -I $TF_INC
Adding a section in how_tos will help.
