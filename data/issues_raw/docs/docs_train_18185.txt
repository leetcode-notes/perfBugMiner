Describe the problem
Many links in the documentation say 'see the guide' and point to Building Graphs > ...
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/framework#Core_graph_data_structures
but no prose guide is present. It would be useful to have some examples of using such methods as tf.reset_default_graph , etc.
For example, the tf.Graph page links to 'Building Graphs': https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph
