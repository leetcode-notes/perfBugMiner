Examples and tutorial missing from pip tensorflow package

After searching for and eventually posting a question on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49007742/tensorflow-examples-and-tutorials-missing-from-the-pip-package) I was recommended to report this as a bug:
When installing Tensorflow (e.g. tensorflow-1.5.0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow/1.5.0) from pip, there is only the tutorials/mnist example in tensorflow/examples. It would be nice to have the examples available without having to get them separately from GitHub. Is there a reason why the rest of the examples are not included? Can they be included in future releases?
