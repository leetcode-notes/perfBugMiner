tf.reduce_mean is not compatible with np.mean

tf.reduce_mean emphasized that this function is compatible with numpy:

Equivalent to np.mean

But it doesn't in the output type. Consider the following code for example:
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.Variable([1, 0, 1, 0])
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)
print(sess.run(tf.reduce_mean(x)))


The output is zero. It seems that tf.reduce_mean infer the output type from the input tensor because casting the input tensor to float values, solve the problem. This attribute is not compatible to np.mean:
import numpy as np
print(np.mean([1,0,0,1]))
