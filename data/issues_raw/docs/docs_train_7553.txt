The updated documentation site does not contain "Setting up TensorFlow for Development"

Recently the TensorFlow web site is updated, and some contents are re-organized.
Since I always forget how to install TF from sources, such as "bazel build ..." then "bazel-bin/...", I frequently refer the official web site.
However, after the update, "Setting up TensorFlow for Development" section has gone away (which were originally located at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup).
I think the contents should be included in "Installing TensorFlow from sources" section, if there was no change in the way for setting for development.
