Misformatted documentation after constant_initializer

The docs for constant_initializer fail to correctly close a code block in one of the examples.  As a result, many other sections are displayed in raw markdown.
See: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/state_ops.html#constant_initializer
