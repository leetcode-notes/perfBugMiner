Bug in Estimator tutorial?

This is the tutorial for the Estimator-class:
https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators
You have the following code:
my_nn = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=[age, height, weight],
                                   hidden_units=[10, 10, 10],
                                   activation_fn=tf.nn.relu,
                                   dropout=0.2,
                                   n_classes=3,
                                   optimizer="Adam")

and the following:
input_layer = tf.feature_column.input_layer(
    features=features, feature_columns=[age, height, weight])

If I understand correctly, the feature-columns use the variables age, height and weight. However, these variables are not defined anywhere in the source-code for the tutorial.
The complete source-code is available in abalone.py as well:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/estimators/abalone.py
But here you no longer have the input_layer that uses the feature-columns. Instead you have the following which pulls out "x" from the features-dict:
# Connect the first hidden layer to input layer
# (features["x"]) with relu activation
first_hidden_layer = tf.layers.dense(features["x"], 10, activation=tf.nn.relu)

So I'm a bit confused how this is supposed to work?
In general, why don't you make the tutorials as Jupyter Notebooks instead? It would be immensely more helpful than your current tutorial style which is very confusing.
And please remember, that for each hour you spend polishing the code, you will likely save several hours of head-aches for each person trying to understand your code. Multiplied by the many thousands of TensorFlow users, this is a tremendous amount of work-hours that is freed up for the community!
