Documentation mentions FeatureValueToId, but it's not found anywhere on the site.

The latest documentation on tensorflow.org expains that for embedding_lookup* functions ids are obtained typically from FeatureValueTold. The last term is not found anywhere else on the site. Probably some remnant from ancient functions.
It should probably be replaced with index_table_from* or something similar.
