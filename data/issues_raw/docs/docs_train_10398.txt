[Docs] "arg_scope" overrides "defined in" paths

I found that some ops have incorrect "defined in" paths in the contrib.layers docs.
Examples: avg_pool2d, batch_norm, bias_add, conv2d, conv2d_in_plane, conv2d_transpose, dropout, flatten, fully_connected, layer_norm, one_hot_encoding, separable_conv2d, softmax
It always uses tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/arg_scope.py which is clearly outright wrong.
This seems to be the case for all ops defined in tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py which are annotated with @add_arg_scope
