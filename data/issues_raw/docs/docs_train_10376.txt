Lack support of qint32 in tf.nn.tanh

According to the doc, the tanh operation supports floating point inputs as well as fixed point inputs of type qint32. However, in the latest master, a TypeError raised when running following code:
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
x = tf.constant([1.,2.,3.], dtype=tf.float32)

from tensorflow.python.ops.gen_array_ops import quantize_v2
x_quant = quantize_v2(x, min_range=0., max_range=4., T=tf.qint32)
y_quant = tf.nn.tanh(x_quant[0])

The complete error message is
TypeError: Value passed to parameter 'x' has DataType qint32 not in list of allowed values: float16, float32, float64, complex64, complex128

According to the backend function _tanh in gen_math_ops.py:
def _tanh(x, name=None):
  r"""Computes hyperbolic tangent of `x` element-wise.

  Args:
    x: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

It shows that it doesn't support qint32.
