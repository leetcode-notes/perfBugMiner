Provide variable scoping documentation

This is to track a documentation request from an external user:
The section on variable scopes is pretty helpful and we have been using it to make more complicated nets more manageable. I think some information (could be informal, like a blog post) on best practices that perhaps Googlers are encouraged to follow in structuring their tensorflow code (e.g. for the purposes of speed, variable re-use, minimizing memory consumption, code reusability) would be of high interest to a lot of people. I get the feeling that most of that information might already be available but just that it is distributed across different parts of the documentation.
