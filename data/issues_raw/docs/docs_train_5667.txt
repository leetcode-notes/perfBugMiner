Documentation shows None default instead of actual op attr default

This is not a bug but a small mistake in the API:
The documentation  says "use_locking" defaults to None in tf.assign.
That parameter is a boolean, so None would not make a lot of sense. In any case, the source code makes it clear the default value is actually False (file: tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py)
I do not know if this is the case with other boolean default arguments in other functions, but I wanted to point it out.
