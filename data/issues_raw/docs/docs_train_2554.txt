Virtualenv installation failure

Environment info
Operating System: OS X 10.10.3
We followed the "Download and Setup" docs and tried to create a Virtualenv environment in the directory ~/tensorflow but it didn't work well.
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow

Using base prefix '/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.7.2.3327.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents'
New python executable in /Users/xxx/tensorflow/tensorflow/bin/python
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/Python
  Referenced from: /Users/xxx/tensorflow/tensorflow/bin/python
  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:
    /Users/xxx/tensorflow/tensorflow/bin/../Python: not a file
ERROR: The executable /Users/xxx/tensorflow/tensorflow/bin/python is not functioning
ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is u'/Users/xxx/tensorflow' (should be u'/Users/xxx/tensorflow/tensorflow')
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable

In my execution environment, -p option is needed as below.
  $ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3 ~/tensorflow

I think the result of the above command is influenced by the execution environment, so please add the -p option.
