Padding type definition is swapped in the documentation.

In http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.md#pooling and http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn.md#convolution
The definition of the padding types should be swapped.
Now it is like this:

padding = 'SAME': Round down (only full size windows are considered).
padding = 'VALID': Round up (partial windows are included).

But it should be like this:

padding = 'SAME': Round up (partial windows are included).
padding = 'VALID': Round down (only full size windows are considered).

I also think it should be made clear that the padding is already included in the shape(value) of the formula "shape(output) = (shape(value) - ksize + 1) / strides".
Or maybe the formula should be changed to the following simpler one (taken from http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#conv):

shape(output) = ((shape(value)+2*pad - ksize) / strides) + 1

where pad = 0 if padding='VALID' or pad = floor(ksize/2) if padding='SAME'.
