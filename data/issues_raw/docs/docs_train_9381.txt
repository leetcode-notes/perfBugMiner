Mac Gpu Link not working?

Hello,
I was trying to install Tensorflow for Mac GPU Python 3 one from github and I found that it is a broken URL Giving me an HTTP 404 Error.
The URL is - https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-matrix-mac-gpu/TF_BUILD_IS_OPT=OPT,TF_BUILD_IS_PIP=PIP,TF_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON3,label=gpu-mac/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/pip_test/whl/tensorflow_gpu-1.1.0rc2-py3-none-any.whl
Please Fix the Url.
Best,
Daksh
