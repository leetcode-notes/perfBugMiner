This is what tf.image.resize_bicubic() produces:

Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

with open('bbf.png', 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

image = tf.image.decode_image(image_bytes)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, 0)

resized_image = tf.image.resize_bicubic(image, [256, 256])

resized_image = tf.cast(resized_image, tf.uint8)
resized_image = tf.squeeze(resized_image)
encoded_image = tf.image.encode_jpeg(resized_image)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    jpg_image = sess.run(encoded_image)
    with open('output.jpg', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(jpg_image)
