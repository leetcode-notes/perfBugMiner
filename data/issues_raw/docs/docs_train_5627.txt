Documentation change for 'Adding a new op ShapeFn'

In Adding a new Op there is the following line of code that describes how to set the shape function:
@tf.RegisterShape("ZeroOut")(common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn)
I think this is wrong (you do not want the @ sign since it's not being used as a decorator). Also, having an explicit import would be helpful.
So it would be nice to change this to:
from tensorflow.python.framework import common_shapes
tf.RegisterShape("ZeroOut")(common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn)
