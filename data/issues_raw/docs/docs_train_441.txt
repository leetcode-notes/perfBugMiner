max_images defaults to 3 images instead of batch_size in tf.image_summary

Even though the default value for the max_images parameter in tf.image_summary is None, a maximum of 3 images are displayed by default.
It looks like this is by design, but I can't find it mentioned in the documentation.  Should a note be added to the docs, or possibly the default value changed to 3 instead of None?
import tensorflow as tf

images = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([10, 48, 48, 1]))

tf.image_summary("max_images_bug_no_param", images) # 3 images displayed

tf.image_summary("max_images_bug_none_param", images, max_images=None) # 3 images displayed

tf.image_summary("max_images_bug_100_param", images, max_images=100) # 10 images displayed

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
    summary_op = tf.merge_all_summaries()
    writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('max_images_bug')
    summary_str = sess.run(summary_op)
    writer.add_summary(summary_str, 0)
