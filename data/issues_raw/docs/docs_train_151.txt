Typo in reshape documentation

Small typo at
http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/array_ops.md#AUTOGENERATED-shapes-and-shaping
Under the reshape example it says:

tensor 't' is [[[1, 1], [2, 2]]
[[3, 3], [4, 4]]]
tensor 't' has shape [2, 2]

But I think t initially has the shape [2, 2, 2] not [2, 2].
