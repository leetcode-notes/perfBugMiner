Incorrect tfBinaryURL for installing with Anaconda on Linux

There is incorrect tfBinaryURL at tensorflow.org.
In case of Installing with Anaconda in Linux, the example shows the following command for Python 2.7.
(tensorflow)$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade 
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.2.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
But this is for Python 3.4 so correct command is below.
(tensorflow)$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade 
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.2.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
