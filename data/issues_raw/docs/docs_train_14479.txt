Wrong link in tensorflow-for-poets codelab

https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#3
There's a link for Inception V3 model pointing to https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim#pre-trained-models which 404's.
I assume it can point to https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567 instead.

I would've sent a PR fixing the link, but the codelab text doesn't seem to be available on anywhere Github. ðŸ˜ž
