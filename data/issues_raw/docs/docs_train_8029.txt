Multiple broken g3doc links

There are, by my count, at least 20 broken g3doc links scattered among documentation, code, and build scripts caused by this commit migrating g3docs to the docs_src + source code documentation generating system.  So far, in relation to this, the following issues have been opened: #8014, #7999, #7989, and the following pull requests have been made: #8018, #7990, #7965.  Two of the pull requests, #8018 and #7990, take care of the two broken links on the core TensorFlow README and are waiting on the signing of CLAs.
Due to the restructuring that took place in the transition from g3doc to docs_src, a simple find-replace won't work.  For example, in reference to this line in fully-connected-reader.py, tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/reading_data.md#reading-from-files would have to be changed to tensorflow/docs_src/programmers_guide/reading_data.md#reading-from-files.  In fact, according to the new reference syntax, it should be changed to @{$reading_data#reading-from-files}.
Moreover, some g3doc files that are still linked to by existing documentation no longer exist in this repository.  E.g., the adding an op extension guide links to many of the Python files contained in this g3doc folder (which has now been deleted.)  Although these Python files should probably be reinstated somewhere, this appears to be the only collection of Python files in g3doc that were deleted and are still needed.
So, how best to go about fixing these issues?  Manually fix each broken link in a single pull request?  And where should the Python files pertaining to the adding an op extension guide be placed?
