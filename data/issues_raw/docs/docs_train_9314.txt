tf.get_collection documentation: argument description is confusing

From https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_collection:
"Items without a name attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied and the choice or re.match means that a scope without special tokens filters by prefix."
What does this mean? Is there a typo here?
