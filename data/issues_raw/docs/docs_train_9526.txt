[Tutorial Update] Logging and Monitoring Basics

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

Describe the problem
The currently published tutorial for Logging and Monitoring is based on functionality that has been identified as deprecated (see i.p. the discussion in #7669 .)
I truly appreciate all the hard work ðŸ’¯  put into moving the functionality of TF itself forward.
It would be most appreciated, if this tutorial could be updated to reflect suggested best practices when using sessionRunHook et al. to ease adoptabilty of TF.
