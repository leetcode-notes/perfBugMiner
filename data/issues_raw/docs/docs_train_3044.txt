Deep MNIST Tutorial would benefit from some diagrams of the neural network architecture

The basic version of this tutorial has a nice diagram that makes it really clear what model the code is attempting to reproduce.
The Deep MNIST for Experts tutorial however doesn't have such an image, especially for the Multilayer Convolutional Network that is the heart of the article. I had a hard time (and still do, a bit) visualising what exactly the model code is attempting to do. I think the tutorial would benefit from some diagrams.
I am willing to contribute this if someone could handhold me a bit as to how the graphic above was generated and what the bar is for contributing to the docs.
