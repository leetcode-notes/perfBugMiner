More descriptive error message when op is not defined for GPU or CPU

When trying to use MaxPoolWithArgmax I got the following error:
InvalidArgumentError: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'MaxPoolWithArgmax' with these attrs
[[Node: MaxPoolWithArgmax_5 = MaxPoolWithArgmaxTargmax=DT_INT64, ksize=[1, 3, 3, 1], padding="SAME", strides=[1, 2, 2, 1]]]
Which doesn't tell me that the op is available in GPU but not in CPU.
