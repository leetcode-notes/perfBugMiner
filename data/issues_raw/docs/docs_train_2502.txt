Method to check for GPU op support

So, given the basic word2vec example being bound to CPU (#514), we can see that tf.nn.embedding_lookup doesn't work on GPU. Therefore, ops that use embedding_lookup internally doesn't support GPU either (for example, nce_loss).
Can we have explicit info in the documentation on which operations are currently GPU-capable and which are not?
For example, are tf.gather or LogUniformCandidateSampler GPU-capable?
