TensorBoard graph key does not match documentation

The key in the TensorBoard UI indicates a "Reference edge" as a single-headed arrow:

while the documentation shows these as double-headed arrows:

Moreover, it appears that the edges indicated as references edges in the UI (according to the key there) are not in fact such edges. For example neither
cs = tf.constant([1,2,3], name='const_share')
vs = tf.Variable([1,2,3], name='var_share')
tf.add(cs, vs, name='opVS1')
tf.add(vs, cs, name='opVS2')


note
tf.add([4],[3], name='opA')


should include reference edges (should they?). But in both cases the key in the UI says that they do.
