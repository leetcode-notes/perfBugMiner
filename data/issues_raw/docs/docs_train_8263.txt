Documentation incorrect for RNN tutorial?

Is it possible the documentation is incorrect on https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent ?
words = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [batch_size, num_steps])
for i in range(num_steps):
    # The value of state is updated after processing each batch of words.
    output, state = lstm(words[:, i], state)

It seems the correct output should be:
output, state = lstm(words[i, :], state)
Since you want to process the words in the same sequence correct?
E.g.
[[The, quick, brown]
[fox, jumped, over]]
words[:,0] == [The, fox]
Whereas what you want is [The, quick, brown]  == words[0,:]
Please correct me if I'm wrong, thanks.
