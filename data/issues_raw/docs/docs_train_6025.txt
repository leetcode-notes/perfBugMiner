For which inputs are gradients computed?

What is a good way to determine which inputs of a tensorflow op are backpropagated through?
For example, consider the crop_and_resize op. The description sounds rather straightforward -

"Extracts crops from the input image tensor and bilinearly resizes them".

However, if you dig through the code, this function pops up _CropAndResizeGrad, which states

"We back-propagate to the image only when the input image tensor has floating point dtype but we always back-propagate to the input boxes tensor.",

which indicates that the input bounding box coordinates will get gradients.
It might just be me, but I have a hard time telling which input tensor variables will get gradients and which will not. Is there a standard way? Should this be part of the documentation?
Thanks.
