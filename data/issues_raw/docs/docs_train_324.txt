TensorBoard Documentation - Confusing and Incorrect in places. (Need End to End Example)

It would be nice to have a complete, end-to-end working example using TensorBoard.  In addition, some of the documentation appears to be incorrect.
Possible Incorrect Documentation:
http://tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.md

A concise, completely coded example may help. Note, more detail is shown here, but it's still have hard to grasp the full picture.  A complete coded example may help.
...
sess.run(init)

# Build the summary operation based on the TF collection of Summaries.
tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, './tenIrisSave/logsd','graph.pbtxt')

tf.scalar_summary("Accuracy:", tf_accuracy)
tf.histogram_summary('weights', tf_weight)
tf.histogram_summary('bias', tf_bias)
tf.histogram_summary('softmax', tf_softmax)
tf.histogram_summary('accuracy', tf_accuracy)


summary_op = tf.merge_all_summaries()
summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('./tenIrisSave/logs',sess.graph_def)

# This will not work. You need the full path.
# tensorboard --logdir=./tenIrisSave/   # BAD!
# tensorboard --logdir=$(pwd)/tenIrisSave/  # Good!

    summary_str = sess.run(summary_op,feed_dict={tf_in: x_test, tf_softmax_correct: y_test_onehot})
    summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i)


The complete example can be seen here:

Agreed. The example needs to be cleaned up. The point is to give the user a complete working example that can be run and verified.
