tfdbg requires external ncurses on OSX

OSX 10.11.6
TF from source at 8746f8ac9 (master HEAD from a few hours ago) without GPU
XCode 8.2.1

When loading it, tfdbg crashes with a curses-related error. Was solved with brew install homebrew/dupes/ncurses. If this is really a dependency, it would be useful to mention it in the documentation or installation guide.
