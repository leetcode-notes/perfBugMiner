API Documentation with Links to Source Code

I think it would be a really great improvement if the API documentation https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/ would contain links to the corresponding source code file on GitHub, similar to python package documentations on readthedocs.org, e.g. https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/layers/base.html.
This would also make it much faster to create pull requests that fix errors in the documentation.
