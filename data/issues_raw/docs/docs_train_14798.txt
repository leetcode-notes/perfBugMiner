Provide a list of supported XLA operations like TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow Lite provides a list of currently supported ops here and I wonder if XLA could also have such a list. It's rough to develop and train a model with the full TensorFlow Python API only to get stuck during AOT compilation because of missing ops kernels in the tf2xla bridge.
