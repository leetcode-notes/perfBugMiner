python documentation for tensorflow.abs out of sync

I checked out the master branch tonight:
d4b5c60
I installed the code with pip into a conda environment
It seems the tensorflow.complex_abs() function has been merged into the overloaded tensorflow.abs() function.
The docstring, along with the rest of the python documentation don't seem to reflect this change:

In [53]: tf.abs?
Signature: tf.abs(x, name=None)
Docstring:
Computes the absolute value of a tensor.
Given a tensor of real numbers x, this operation returns a tensor
containing the absolute value of each element in x. For example, if x is
an input element and y is an output element, this operation computes
\(y = |x|\).
Args:
x: A Tensor or SparseTensor of type float32, float64, int32, or
int64.
name: A name for the operation (optional).
Returns:
A Tensor or SparseTensor the same size and type as x with absolute
values.
File:      ~/src/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py
Type:      function
