[docs] Windows Instructions need updating.

Any way to contribute to the installation instructions for Windows? I deal with a lot of people having installation instructions on Stack Overflow etc. and there are a couple of things on the Install pages that could do with being corrected, clarified or changed. Happy to do these myself if you'd like. I'll list them below:


"TensorFlow only supports version 3.5.x of Python on Windows." is no longer true since 1.2 as 3.6 is supported.


The r1.3 version of the install page introduces this new line: "TensorFlow will not load if it cannot find cuDNN64_5.dll. To use a different version of cuDNN, you must build from source." however I thought that 1.3 was built with cuDNN 6. Users may find this conflict confusing because, as I found with #11645, 1.3.0 will NOT load with cuDNN64_5.dll. Shouldn't this change to cuDNN64_6.dll?


Anaconda Installation slightly misleading? I use anaconda to run our tensorflow environments without a problem. I download via pip install tensorflow(-gpu) instead of the unsupported conda version and, from a user's point of view, there's no reason for it be unsupported. is there a reason that a pypi installation put in an anaconda environment would act differently enough to virtual env/root install to be unsupported? I also don't see why the installation page can't recommend downloading straight from pypi instead of using the long storage.googleapis... url. Especially as 3.6 is now supported.


Happy to implement these changes if I knew where. Are the markdown files in docs_src linked to the website? If so i'll pop a PR into there.
Cheers
