/tutorials/using_gpu doc (possibly other) should use print() since Windows needs Python 3.x

Should the Python samples in /tutorials/using_gpu and other docs be in 3.5.x form?

In /install/install_windows we're told "TensorFlow only supports version 3.5.x of Python on Windows"
In /tutorials/using_gpu there is sample Python code in 2.x style, "print sess.run(c)"
This code snippet chokes when run on Windows, while print(sess.run(c)) is fine. Trivial to fix but distracts from the task at hand.

There may be more nuance to this (afaik print with parens is ok in 2.7), but it seems like avoidable friction if not.
