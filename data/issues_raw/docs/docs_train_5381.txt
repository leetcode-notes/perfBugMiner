Documentation For The New Version of Histogram on TensorBoard

Hello~
I'm trying to interpret the new version of the histogram and it looks like the x-axis represents the value/bin, y-axis represent the step/time, and z-axis represents the density since it is a continuous number. In addition, the color represents the standard deviation??
Is my interpretation correct? If so, I can help putting up the documentation for the new histogram tab.
Thanks!
