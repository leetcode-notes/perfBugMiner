Correction to Getting Started

Hello,
I would like to submit that there is a programming bug on line 29 of the "custom model tutorial" within Getting Started with Tensorflow.
The line should read:
input_fn = tf.contrib.learn.io.numpy_input_fn({"x":x_train}, y_train, batch_size=4, num_epochs=1000)
​Best regards.
Jeff​
