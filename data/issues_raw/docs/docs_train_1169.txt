Broken link in "A Tool Developer's Guide..." for graph_metrics.py

Here is the link for graph_metrics.py in this tutorial but it's broken:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorfl%0Aow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py
Update:
Just found other links to the files, such as freeze_graph() and tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.proto also not working.
