tf.estimator Quickstart web doc needs syncing with GitHub

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.11.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda-forge
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: Copy and paste code sample and run on a Jupter Notebook. The code sample on GitHub works (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/estimator.md). The code sample on Tensorflow documentation doesn't (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator). My guess is that the web documentation requires "syncing" with Github version?

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
This is regarding (possibly out-dated) web documentation not "synced" with the correct GitHub version.

The code sample on Tensorflow documentation doesn't run on Python 3.6 / TensorFlow v1.3 (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator).
The code sample on GitHub works (probably more up to date)
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/estimator.md).

Source code / logs
If you copy and paste the code sample from web documentation and run on a Jupter notebook, you get:
AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'

(this has been addressed in GitHub repo sample code. Just not the web doc).
Also, the line that reads (for both training and test):
with open(IRIS_TRAINING, "w") as f:
should be corrected to:
with open(IRIS_TRAINING, "wb") as f:

(again, this has been addressed in GitHub repo sample code. Just not the web doc).
So possible just need a refresh of the code sample on the web doc?
i.e. replace the current web doc with the GitHub doc?
Thanks!
