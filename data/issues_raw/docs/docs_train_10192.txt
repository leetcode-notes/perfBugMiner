How to know what commands and types are supported in iOS build?

According to this comment  and other related issues currently there is some commands and types that iOS users can't load from frozen.pb graph. So we could use any TF API in python but not in iOS. It is hard to guess what python API will not been supported in iOS. So is there any documentation or instructions of how to write solution using python API and what functions and types could be used to make frozen.pb graph be fully supported by iOS API?
