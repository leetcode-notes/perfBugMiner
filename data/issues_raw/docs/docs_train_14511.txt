How can I have an Online Data Augmentation like Keras in Tensorflow (tf-slim)?

Hi all,
I use tf-slim (this network) for my classification problem. I want to do online data augmentation like Keras ImageDataGenerator for my images. I know these functions in Tensorflow, but I need a tutorial or an example in Tensorflow or tf-slim that does this online data augmentation. Would you please, help me to find a way to do this?
