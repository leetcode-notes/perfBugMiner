TensorFlow for Poets: Section 5: label_image.py on site is different than curl version

Link: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#4
On the site, the label_image.py script uses relative paths for files while the version the tutorial asks users to curl uses absolute paths for files.
If the user is knowledgeable enough to prefer copying the script on the website vs. curl'ing it from https://goo.gl/tx3dqg, then the user might run into an issue where they first need to run cd / before being able to run the script as-is.
