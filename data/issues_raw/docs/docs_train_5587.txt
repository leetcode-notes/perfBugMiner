iOS No OpKernel to support TruncatedNormal

I have a NN similar to this one: http://stackoverflow.com/a/38576462/828184 and my iOS project is based on the simple contrib example.
I write out the graph.pb file like so (and replace it with the original iOS one):
tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, 'NNModel/', 'graph.pb', as_text=False)
But XCode crashes on execution with this error:

RunModelViewController.mm: Could not create TensorFlow Graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'TruncatedNormal' with these attrs.  Registered kernels:

[[Node: OutputLayer/truncated_normal/TruncatedNormal = TruncatedNormalT=DT_INT32, dtype=DT_FLOAT, seed=0, seed2=0]]

I guess it's because of the usage of tf.truncated_normal(...). Is there an alternative to that call or am I doing something wrong?
So far I got a minimalistic multiplication graph working on iOS but no trained NN.
