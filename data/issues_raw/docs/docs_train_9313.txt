`Evaluable` docs: name, checkpoint_path, and hooks should be new bullets.

See https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/Evaluable - final params for evaluate() are not bullets, making reading the documentation less readable. I've seen this in other docs too (can comment if I come across more of them).
I wonder if the parser has some bug that causes it to not bullet-ify some params for functions.
