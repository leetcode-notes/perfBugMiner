Minor but confusing mistake in doc about shape of output tensor of gather_nd

According to the docs of gather_nd(params, indices), the output tensor produced by the function has shape
[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, params.shape[K], ..., params.shape[P-1]].

where [d_0, ..., d_{Q-2} are the dimensions of indices without the last one, P is the rank of params and K is the length of the innermost dimension of indices. Firstly, I believe it should say params.shape[K-1] instead of params.shape[K]. But even then, I think that this formula is only true if K < P, i.e. for slices. For access to elements, consider the following example:
# data is shape [2, 3, 2]
data = np.reshape(np.arange(12), [2, 3, 2])
x = tf.constant(data)
# indices is shape [2, 3]
indices = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]])
# result is shape [2, ]
result = tf.gather_nd(x, indices)

According to the above formula, the output tensor should have shape [2, 2], which it does not. I guess the correct formula for element access should be
[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}]

This might already be implicitly assumed with the above formula, but if so, it is not very clear. I realise that this is a super minor thing and one can easily find out the behaviour by doing some tests. However I still wanted to raise it, as I found it a bit tricky to get the hang of gather_nd in the first place and these subtle differences confused me even more.
