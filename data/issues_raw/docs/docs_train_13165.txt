Doc nicety: use * to indicate when arguments must be keywords

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits shows the signature
softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
    _sentinel=None,
    labels=None,
    logits=None,
    dim=-1,
    name=None
)

In Python 3, the syntax for _sentinel=None is just *, and the signature would be
softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
    *,
    labels,
    logits,
    dim=-1,
    name=None
)

where I've additionally removed the false defaults from labels and logits.  This can't be done to the code which has to be 2.7 compatible, but it could be done to the documentation.
