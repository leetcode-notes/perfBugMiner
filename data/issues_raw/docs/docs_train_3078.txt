Allow use of gitter.im for tensorflow/tensorflow repo

As far as I could tell, there is no place for the community to discuss tensorflow in realtime; the recommendations all seem to be about asking specific questions in a detailed async fashion.
It would be nice if there was a gitter.im or IRC channel for tensorflow so that the community could interact more easily. not even as a dedicated support channel.
There is already a gitter.im for skflow, but since fewer people know about skflow, let alone the gitter.im for it, it's pretty small: https://gitter.im/tensorflow/skflow
It would be even nicer if the channel was linked from the repo, but gitter.im is nice since it has some automatic discoverability if you're already familiar with gitter
