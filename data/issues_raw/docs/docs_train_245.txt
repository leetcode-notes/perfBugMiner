word2vec tutorial plot labels are incorrect

The plot produced by the word2vec tutorial looks like random words.
In tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py line 223 (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py#L223), the code gets labels for the first 500 words/embeddings by extracting 500 keys from the word dictionary without respect to their indices, using:
labels = list(dictionary.keys())[:plot_only]

Line 223 should probably be something like the following, since the each key's value is the word index:
labels = list(sorted(dictionary, key=dictionary.get))[:plot_only]
