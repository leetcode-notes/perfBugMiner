Documentation issues regarding installing on ubuntu

While I was perusing the documentation for install_linux, I got to the section Determine which TensorFlow to install, and then I continued on.
I was at Determine how to install TensorFlow and I settled on Virtualenv. So I went to that section, and I followed the steps. But when I got to the sub-section (2) stating

where targetDirectory specifies the top of the Virtualenv tree. Our instructions assume that targetDirectory is ~/tensorflow, but you may choose any directory.

I was caught off guard a bit. I didn't know if I had missed something, so I spent a bit of time back-tracking the documentation to see if that was the case. I finally decided to mkdir ~/tensorflow and give it a go.
It would be nice if there was a (sub-)section stating this. I don't want to write it, so I'm making it as an issue instead. I did do this amazing thing though: #18766
