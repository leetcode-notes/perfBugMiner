[Docs] A mismatch bug in api_docs

There is a mismatch bug in api_docs about tf.graph. It's easy to find that tf.Graph.init() {:#Graph.init} is a error. And I check the original script ops.py, it seems like the {:#Graph.init} is added by other script.
At the same time, it causes the index URL#Graph.init ineffectively.
