Iterator.get_next() documentation improvement request

Describe the problem
Recently I've written some code using Dataset API and I would like to request a problem with documentation (IMO).  Instead of hardcoding comments here, please, move @mrry's annotation about Iterator.get_next() and GET_NEXT_CALL_WARNING_THRESHOLD into get_next() method documentation.
I don't know why I didn't get that beautiful warning on my console output but I think I'm not the first person with funny thread-bomb running and consuming system resources. :) You know about that also (see comment).
So... It would be great if you could move all critical annotation into main documentation. I'm thinking now about all ML newcomers rather than me (Yeah, I actually found solution by myself :))
That's all.
