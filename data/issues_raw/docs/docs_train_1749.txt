Request: Better documentation on TFRecords and their use

I am using TFRecords to use the sharding/queuing machinery. For simple problems for which the examples can be cloned, it is easy to use. But recently I tried to do something more complex: train examples where there are multiple labels. I posted a question on Stackoverflow about the specific issue I have: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36365118/how-do-you-write-and-retrieve-tfrecord-features-that-are-lists
It would be nice to have clearer guidance on the use of TFRecords. I've looked through the code, have a pretty good understanding of Protocol Buffers, etc. In spite of this it is difficult to understand how the machinery works.
