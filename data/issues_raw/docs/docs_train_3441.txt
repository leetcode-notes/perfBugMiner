Documentation for 'Adding a new op'

This is a feature request. Currently, I find the documentation for 'Adding an Op' quite minimal. There are a few important questions that remain unanswered:

How should one use multithreaded CPU code in an operation? Can we use OpenMP? How many threads should an op use? It is hard to find this in the implementations of existing ops, because they are all based on Eigen.
How should a GPU version of the op be written? Should it be a cuda kernel, or the code spawning cuda kernels? Maybe there could be a simple example for both CPU and GPU code not using Eigen.
