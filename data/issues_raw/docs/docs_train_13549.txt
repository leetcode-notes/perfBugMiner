const_op.h missing from C++ API documentation

I could not find the documentation for tensorflow::ops::Const starting from the C++ API documentation. I figured out it is declared in ops/const_op.h, but there is no link from the main C++ docs:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/
A search returns this, but it looks orphaned:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/group/const-op
So I guess there is something wrong in the docs.
