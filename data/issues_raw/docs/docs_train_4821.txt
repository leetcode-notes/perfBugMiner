Request for documentation: quantize_training in python

Poking around, I find https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=quantize_training
However there is no documents that I can find describe how this can be used. Can we add some example and also documentation around it so that people can start to play with it?
