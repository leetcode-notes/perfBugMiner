Following cuda install directions can lead to wrong version

If you follow the link from the cuda install directions, and are trying to install under Ubuntu you will end up on this page:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-70
Unfortunately if you select the "Network Install" option and install the repository deb, you will end up installing cuda 7.5 not 7.0.
I suggest mentioning this before users click through to nvidia's site in the docs:
