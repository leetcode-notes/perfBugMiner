API pages could use some search optimization

When I search on Google for Tensorflow methods, the documentation is hard to distinguish in the search results. The API pages have irrelevant titles and aren't as highly ranked as they should be.
To reproduce:
Search for [tf extract_image_patches]
Expected behavior: I get a result with the API documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/array_ops.html
Observed behavior: this page shows up as result 3 with the mysterious title "tf.pack - TensorFlow"
Another example is EveryN. If I add enough keywords, I get the API page as result 4 (search on [tf EveryN api tf.contrib.learn]). But it has the inscrutable title "tf.contrib.learn.monitors.ExportMonitor.run_on_all_workers - TensorFlow"
This makes it difficult to find the documentation for methods.
Suggested fix: maybe make the page titles more descriptive, and add the word "API"? Maybe have separate pages for each class, like JavaDocs?
