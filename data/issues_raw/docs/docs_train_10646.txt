Clarify Installation Docs for Windows (32-bit)

Quick feature/docs request. I've noticed a few people on Stack Overflow asking about running Tensorflow on 32-bit machines. I'm aware that some people have had some success as described by @mrry 's post here:
S/O: "TensorFlow on 32-bit Linux?"
One example of a confused user trying to use Windows:
S/O: "how to install tensorflow for windows 7 32bit system?i installed python 3.5(32 bit) into my system and also installed anaconda 3.4.4(32 bit)"
I was wondering whether it was worth putting a little system requirement that reminded users that Tensorflow is only supported on 64 bit machines on the install page? Unless it is not then perhaps some little clarification? Cheers
