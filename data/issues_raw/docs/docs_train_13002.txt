1_notmnist assignment1 zero mean equation in code

Okay in tutorial its say to make zero mean do r-128/128 but in code its r-128/255
Below is the code provided in ipython notebook
image_size = 28  # Pixel width and height.
pixel_depth = 255.0  # Number of levels per pixel.
def load_letter(folder, min_num_images):
"""Load the data for a single letter label."""
image_files = os.listdir(folder)
dataset = np.ndarray(shape=(len(image_files), image_size, image_size),
dtype=np.float32)
print(folder)
num_images = 0
for image in image_files:
image_file = os.path.join(folder, image)
try:
image_data = (ndimage.imread(image_file).astype(float) -
pixel_depth / 2) / pixel_depth
if image_data.shape != (image_size, image_size):
raise Exception('Unexpected image shape: %s' % str(image_data.shape))
dataset[num_images, :, :] = image_data
num_images = num_images + 1
except IOError as e:
print('Could not read:', image_file, ':', e, '- it's ok, skipping.')
