I have a image segmentation network designed to classify roads and obstacles.  I want to freeze the model and serve it as a API. So I used the default TensorFlow tool for freezing the model. After freezing, the output given by the network are completely off and inaccurate.
Here is one sample.

Output after Freezing the Model

I have tried to freeze using different versions of tensorflow, but that has not helped. Since the network is performing as excepted when tested against checkpoint, the issue, I think is in the Freeze Models Script. The network uses Batch_normalisation. Could this be the reason for this drop because I saw a couple of issues linked to that of similar nature? How can I avoid that?
