Dataset.from_generator doesn't play nice with feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list

Describe the problem
I have the same code in two versions, one using Dataset.from_generator and one using Dataset.from_tensor_slices. To me it looks like the created Datasets have the exact same content, but feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list doesn't work with the from_generator one, which ought to be a bug, right?
