TF 0.6.0 slower than 0.5.0 with the cifar10 example

With the tensorflow/model/image/cifar10 example. While I run cifar10_train.py,
It used to be able to achieve around 400+ examples/sec with my single K40 GPU. Today I pulled the code and installed the latest version (0.6.0x), but it can only achieve 300 examples/sec or less sometimes.
I see Alexnet benchmark performance gets improved, but this actually use case gets worse performance.
