Describe the problem
In the libcurl programming tutorial under the section "Persistence Is The Way to Happiness" it notes that re-cycling the same easy handle can give several benefits. This could lead to performance improvements when using remote filesystems that utilise this class (e.g. gcs file system and I've been working on azure blob storage). Currently it seems that a single instance of the CurlHttpRequest and hence curl handle can only be used once and must be instantiated per request.
Is this worth investigating to integrate some sort of 'reset' method to this class along with curl_easy_reset plus extract defaults set in the constructor into a 'setup defaults' method? Plus some profiling to ensure the change is better?
