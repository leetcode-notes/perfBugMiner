[Bug] Silent memory failure

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes (see below)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Lubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.7.0-3-g024aecf414 1.7.0
Python version: Python 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:  Driver Version: 390.30 CUDA Driver Version = 9.1
GPU model and memory: NVidia GTX 1080Ti (11Go)
Exact command to reproduce: copy paste the given code and call the only function (if running on a  GPU with different memory please fiddle with the size of the arrays accordingly)

Describe the problem
When run on GPU the program runs fine except results are silently zeroed for elements in the last 25% of result. It only happens when I it uses a lot of memory but instead of failing it tries to compute and silently mess the results.
