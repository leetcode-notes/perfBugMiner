contrib.nccl.broadcast raises UnimplementedError

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-devel-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below): nightly (also 1.7rc1)
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.0.5

Exact command to reproduce:

Copying repro from #15425 (comment):
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.contrib.nccl as nccl

if __name__ == '__main__':
    devices = ['/gpu:0', '/gpu:0']
    with tf.device(devices[0]):
        data0 = tf.constant([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4])
        received_tensor = nccl.broadcast(data0)
    received_tensors = []
    for device in devices[1:]:
        with tf.device(device):
            received_tensors.append(tf.identity(received_tensor))
    sess = tf.Session()
    sess.run(received_tensors)
