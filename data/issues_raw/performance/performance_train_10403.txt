contrib/learn/python/learn_io/data_feeder.py : "y_is_dict" instead of "x_is_dict" at line 325

version r1.2
I was trying to create a regressor with X as dict, and y as ndarray. Got error that at line mentioned in title saying ndarray object as no attribute items.
When I checked the code, it look like
    x_is_dict, y_is_dict = isinstance(x, dict), y is not None and isinstance(y, dict)
    if isinstance(y, list):
      y = np.array(y)

    self._x = dict([(k, check_array(v, v.dtype)) for k, v in list(x.items())
                   ]) if x_is_dict else check_array(x, x.dtype)
    self._y = None if y is None else \
      dict([(k, check_array(v, v.dtype)) for k, v in list(y.items())]) if x_is_dict else check_array(y, y.dtype)

This x_is_dict in the last line should be y_is_dict!! Or do I have to send both as dict??
