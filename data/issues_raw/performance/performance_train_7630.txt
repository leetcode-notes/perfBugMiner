Poor Constant Propagation

Running on the 1.0.0 Docker image.
Compare this:
tensor_util.constant_value_as_shape(ops.convert_to_tensor((tf.constant(15),16)))
> TensorShape([Dimension(15), Dimension(16)])

to:
tensor_util.constant_value_as_shape(ops.convert_to_tensor((tf.constant(15) * 1,16)))
> TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(16)])

It seems to me that constant propagation should happen in the latter. This leads to size information being lost in certain cases such as image upsampling / downsampling where constant size is multiplied and then fed to something like resize_images.
