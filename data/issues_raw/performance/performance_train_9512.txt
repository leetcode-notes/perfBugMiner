Tensorboard cannot load more than two event file in logdir

Describe the problem
When restart the training (due to some hyper parameter adjustment) the third time, Tensorboard cannot load the new event file. It can only load the first two event file and after that scalar will stop refreshing.
Powershell console gave the following output:
[tensor] PS D:\Workspace\ConsorFlow> tensorboard.exe --logdir '../input_data/lpr_train_exp_01'

About this problem in Ubuntu:
I just switch to windows several days ago, such problem did not exist in Ubuntu (at least 14.04). I was using the exact same script, but with tensorflow version 1.01 (GPU, not nightly version), install following the offical instruction.
Under windows, it was because of #7500, which leave me no choice but to install a nightly build.
