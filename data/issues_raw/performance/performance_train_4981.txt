FastGFile ResourceExhaustedError

In tensorflow/models@2390974 @cshallue changed some tf.gfile.FastGFile() calls to open() because two RedHat users reported in #4685 that it causes ResourceExhaustedError even though resources don't appear to be exhausted.
We've also had the same issue reported in tensorflow/models#531, tensorflow/models#489, and tensorflow/models#480 but we're still waiting to learn if they're using RedHat.
Assigning to @rohan100jain who has done work on this code in the past.
