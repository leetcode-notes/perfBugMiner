Timeline only produced for the last invocation on Session.run

Hi!
First of all, thanks for the great profiling/timeline feature! I think it can be really amazing to debug model performance.
I do have a question though: is it possible to create a timeline for multiple invocations of Session.run?
In all the examples that I saw, timeline creation looks something along the lines of this:
run_options = tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()

sess.run(result, options=run_options, run_metadata=run_metadata)

tl = timeline.Timeline(run_metadata.step_stats)
ctf = tl.generate_chrome_trace_format()

This is all good and well, but this generates the trace only for one invocation of Session.run. If it is invoked multiple times (for example in batch training), the step_stats in the run_metadata are always overwritten by the last run.
Is there a way to aggregate the timing data to create a timeline that spans over multiple invocations?
I would need this to debug performance decay over long periods.
