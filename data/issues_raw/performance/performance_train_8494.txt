Segfault: "Check failed: num_elements_ <= kMaxElements"

I'm running the current nightly build as of today (2017-03-17). I'm working with very large, sparse matrices, and my program seems to have hit a variable overflow. It crashed with the following log entry:
2017-03-17 10:48:34.554715: F tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:212] Check failed: num_elements_ <= kMaxElements (1141286132736 vs. 1099511627776)
Aborted (core dumped)

I'm guessing this is because my sparse matrix is too large to handle for tensorflow. It would be great if this could somehow be fixed. Please refer to #7783 for more details about my code (that was another overflow issue I encountered).
