AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Copy' on fully_connected.py. Built from source on 15th February.

I built from source on 15th February. I can run cifar10_train.py, with the warning during training as stated here.
#1076
I can run the convolutional mnist with no problems. However, when I try fully_connected.py, this error shows up.
Traceback (most recent call last):

I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling TensorFlow. I don't think it's a problem with the installation since some examples run properly. Anyone else facing this too?
