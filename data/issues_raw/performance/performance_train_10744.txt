[PIP] Markdown version locked to `2.2.0`

This markdown version lock could cause versioning conflict for downstream (e.g. if requirements are compiled and resolved by pip-compile). Wondering If there's a reason to lock this version. And it's already not sync with the CI install script (those --upgrade with locked version also doesn't seem right to me).
