fatal error: tensorflow/stream_executor/lib/status.h: No such file or directory

I try to write my own op and I have installed TensorFlow 0.12.0 with GPU support on Linux.
This code fails:
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/stream_executor.h"

With error:
fatal error: tensorflow/stream_executor/lib/status.h: No such file or directory

That files does not exists.
Some more include files seem to be missing. When grepping for DeviceMemory in the include path, the only file it finds is include/tensorflow/core/util/stream_executor_util.h.
