Hello,
I'm facing performance issues with the last releases of TF using a CPU.
I'm using the benchmark tool to calculate mean inference time of a model.
For example, in order to evaluate mobilenet (trained on a custom dataset), I'm using this command :
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/benchmark/benchmark_model --graph="path to mobilenet graph" --input_layer="input" --input_layer_shape="1,224,224,3" --input_layer_type="float" --output_layer="MobilenetV1/Predictions/Reshape_1"
After setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to "" in order to run on CPU.
With TF 1.4.1, I obtain a mean inference time equals to 26ms (13ms if I compile with optimization flags).
Using tf 1.5.*, I obtain a mean inference time equals to 51ms (45ms if I compile with optimization flags).
The loss is very important, so I'm wondering if it's a known issue and how I can improve this.
I tried with tags/v1.5.0-rc0, tags/v1.5.0-rc1 and master, and the problem is the same.
Thank you
