RecordInput mini batches for dividing processing among multiple devices.

Adds one component of the high performance models tensorflow benchmark upstream so it is more readily available. This is based on the minibatch function in preprocessing.py in the example benchmark.
I need to write a test, but wasn't sure if this is the right place to add this functionality to the API.
