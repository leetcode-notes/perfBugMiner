4x slowdown in feed_dict in tf-nightly-gpu

Upgrading to pip install tf-nightly-gpu from pip install tensorflow (1.5) slows down feeding about 4x
Feeding 100MB array used to take 15ms, and it takes 60ms after the change. I think this is due to change in alignment requirements for AVX-compiled binary. I want to start the thread to figure out how to regain the performance before these changes make it into official release
benchmark: align_feed_bug.py
# version: 1.5.0
python align_feed_bug.py
feed-cpu-variable   : min: 17.17, median: 19.95, mean: 19.82

# After upgrading to tf nightly
# version: 1.7.0-dev20180221
python align_feed_bug.py
feed-cpu-variable   : min: 53.97, median: 57.15, mean: 66.60

I've tried using @eamartin 's recipe (numpy/numpy#5312 (comment)) to make sure numpy array are 128-byte aligned, but that didn't make any difference in speed
python align_feed_bug.py --align=1
feed-cpu-variable   : min: 49.54, median: 50.50, mean: 60.06
