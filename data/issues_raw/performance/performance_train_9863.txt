Describe the problem
There seems to be an error in the downloading of the test data in the distributed training example census_widendeep.py. The test data is loaded from the file before the file is actually downloaded (lines 152-153):
test_file = open(test_file_path)
urllib.urlretrieve(test_data_url, test_file_path)
