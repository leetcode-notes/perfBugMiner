sparse_placeholder no longer accepts python ints in shape argument

Hi,
After recently updating tensorflow, sparse_placeholder stopped working correctly.  It appears that the shape argument must now be int64 in order for tensorflow to convert the shape to a tensor, so the following fails:
ph = tf.sparse_placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(50, 10000))

with error message:
ValueError: Tensor conversion requested dtype int64 for Tensor with dtype int32: 'Tensor("Const:0", shape=(2,), dtype=int32)'

This is inconsistent with the behavior of tf.placeholder, for which:
ph = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(50, 10000))

succeeds.
Thanks,
Shawn
