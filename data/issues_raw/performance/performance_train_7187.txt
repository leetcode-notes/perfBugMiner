hclhkbu dlbench shows Tensorflow is slower than other frameworks

Based on #7065 (comment)
Recent update of Benchmarking State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Software Tools (by @shyhuai @FreemanX @xiaowec , if I got it right) shows some performance issues. For example, (see table 7) AlexNet-R is significantly (~ 10 times) slower in TF than in other frameworks, an it's even slower at GTX 980 than at GTX 1080. Also, ResNet-50 is ~5.5 times faster in MXNet. Those are most significant differences.
In addition, LSTM is around 3 times faster in CNTK, and ResNet-56 is twice faster in MXNet.
Version used was TensorFlow 0.11 (commit 47dd089) with CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1
