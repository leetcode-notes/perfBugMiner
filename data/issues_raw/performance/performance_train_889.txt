Large Strides for 1x1 Convolutions

When a conv2d operator has a stride greater than the kernel size, the following error is thrown:
ValueError: ('stride must be less than or equal to filter size', 'stride: [2x2] filter: [Dimension(1)xDimension(1)]')
This makes implementing the 1x1 convolutions used to reduce spatial resolution in several papers (MSRA 2015 among others) awkward. Also, a convolution with stride greater than kernel size may be unusual but is it still well defined. Fixing this may be as simple as removing this assertion.
Thanks to everyone who developed TensorFlow, it's a fascinating tool.
