contrib.layers: TypeError: optimize_loss() got an unexpected keyword argument 'summaries'

Trying to provide a custom list of summaries to tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss fails
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss(tf.constant(1), tf.constant(1), 0.01, tf.train.AdamOptimizer, summaries=['loss', 'gradients'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: optimize_loss() got an unexpected keyword argument 'summaries'

Tested on a fresh 0.10.0rc0 install, as well as in the tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly docker image.
Little mystified by how this is occuring since the it's correct in source. I suspect it has something to do with everything being brought into the layers namespace.
