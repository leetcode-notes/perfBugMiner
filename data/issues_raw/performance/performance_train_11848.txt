Can't import graph containing batch_sequences_with_states

Describe the problem
As I'm working with sequences I make extensive use of tf.contrib.training.batch_seq_with_states. I need to be able to load my graph afterwards so I write out a meta graph file containing a graph definition using Saver.save. Upon loading using tf.train.import_meta_graph I get an error hinting the batch_seq_with_states operation isn't saved in the graph:
(Pdb) tf.train.import_meta_graph('model.ckpt-1.meta')
*** KeyError: "The name 'input/batch_seq_with_states/InputQueueingStateSaver/' refers to an Operation not in the graph."

Using Tensorboard I can inspect input/batch_seq_with_states/InputQueueingStateSaver just fine from the same files.
I will for now try to work around this by writing out a separate graph that relies on placeholders for data loading instead of batch_seq_with_states and then load the weights separate.
