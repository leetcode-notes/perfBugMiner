Describe the problem
When using Keras layers in combination with tf.name_scope(a_name), a_name is added to the name of the layers. I would also expect it to be added to the name of the weights/variables that Keras creates internally. However, that is not the case. Having an automatic way of adding a name scope to the weights is highly desirable, though.
Source code / logs
with tf.name_scope("test"):
     a = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,))
     b = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)(a)

Output:
Executing a.name returns test/input_1:0 as expected.
tf.trainable_variables() returns:
[<tf.Variable 'dense/kernel:0' shape=(5, 5) dtype=float32_ref>, <tf.Variable 'dense/bias:0' shape=(5,) dtype=float32_ref>]
