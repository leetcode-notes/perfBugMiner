WideNet in examples/learn  throws error on UBUNTU 16.04 LTS

Am running TensorFlow (0.11.0rc0) On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed via pip
I was going through the guides at  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep/  I thought that my code had an error, but then running the example script at  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/learn/wide_n_deep_tutorial.py
Also throws the same error is the problem my environment? the script or Ubuntu 16.04 I haven't tried it in 14.04.
