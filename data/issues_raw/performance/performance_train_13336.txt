Describe the problem
Continued from this discussion. I want to export a custom Estimator (multiple CNN layer + CTC loss in multi GPU setting derived from cifar-10 multi GPU example) using export_savemodel(). But i encountered this error:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device for operation 'save/ShardedFilename_1': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
this should not occured in 1.3.0 (please see discussion)
