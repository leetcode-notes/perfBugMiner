Convolution for 1D

Dear community,
Do you know of any implementation for 1 dimensional convolution in TensorFlow?
For the moment, I circumvented this by using conv2d with a filter of 5x1. This works good and I was able to surpass state-of-the-art performances on some datasets. However, this short-term 'hack' doesn't allow for longer strides. With a 5x1 filter, I cannot make strides of 2. Tensorflow will raise error that 'stride must be less than or equal to filter size'
Do you know of any 1D implementation for tf.nn.conv2d?
If not, how can I recommend this to the developing team of TensorFlow? A 1D conv would make TensorFlow useful to the world of time-series classification, which is a plus for TensorFlow as well
Thank you in advance!
Rob
