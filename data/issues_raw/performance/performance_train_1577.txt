TensorBoard: histogram charts sometimes duplicated

I unclicked run1 and run2, but when I click on some variables, the run1 and run2 still show up. If I click on run1 and run2 again, five plots will be shown, with 2 of them repeated! By unclicking and clicking a run1, my board just messed up with more and more plots. This is a Google product? :-O
