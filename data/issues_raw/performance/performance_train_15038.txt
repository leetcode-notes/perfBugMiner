Why tensorflow don't support tf.float64 on some ops?

Reproducing experiment of some paper using tensorflow may don't have good performance. I have tried my best to keep the structure and hyper-parameters unchanged. Does anyone encounter similar problem? Is it the code wrong?  I wonder that caffe can use float64 but tensorflow only can use float32,  so there are more inaccuracy on gradients, why tf don't support tf.float64?
