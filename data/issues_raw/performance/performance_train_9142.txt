Make bounding box operators consistent

Right now, the bounding box operators (tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes, tf.image.non_max_suppression and tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box) expect bounding boxes in the form of [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], with the origin (0,0) being the lower left corner of the image. But images themselves are tensors, and the pixel with index [0,0] in the tensor is in the top left, so bounding box coordinates are the opposite in the y direction to tensor indices.
Additionally, the operations tf.image.pad_to_bounding_box and tf.image.crop_to_bounding_box take coordinates in the form of [ymin, xmin, height, width], with the origin being the top-left corner, so the coordinates are inconsistent even within the image ops themselves (plus the parametrization of the bounding boxes is different, too).
And the tf.image.crop_and_resize op doesn't specify what origin it uses (though I think it's bottom left too)
I feel like this sort of inconsistency is unnecessarily confusing and a high risk for introducing errors.
It's especially bad since, if you supply bounding boxes the wrong way around to draw_bounding_boxes, it'll still draw them correctly (
All bounding box operators should use the same coordinate system and preferably the same parametrization, and preferably the coordinates should be consistent with image tensor indexing.
