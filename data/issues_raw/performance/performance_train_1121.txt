AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gfile' in 0.7.0 [Fixed in source, will be in next binary release]

I'm on an Ubuntu machine, installed tensorflow and ran the image processing example as in the website but it failed complaining about gFile not found,
Here's the exception stack:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "classify_image.py", line 213, in <module>
        tf.app.run()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/default/_app.py", line 30, in run
        sys.exit(main(sys.argv))

        if not tf.gfile.Exists(image):
