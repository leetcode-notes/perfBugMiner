Tensorboard graphs broken in v0.7.0 [Fixed in source, will be in next binary release]

After upgrading from v0.6.0 to v0.7.0 via
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl

Tensorboard graph functionality is empty, while the rest of tensorboard seems fine.
Image shows what I get at http://0.0.0.0:6006/#graphs
