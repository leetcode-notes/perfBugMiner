Slim namespace has non-slim symbols

tensorflow/contrib/slim/init.py makes symbols from unrelated namespaces available in its own.
from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops.arg_scope import *
from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops.variables import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers.initializers import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers.regularizers import *
This makes it difficult for users to reference names canonically. For example #4887 where a user said tf.contrib.slim.arg_scope instead of tf.contrib.framework.arg_scope.
We almost certainly want to refactor this namespace so it only exports symbols belonging to slim.
