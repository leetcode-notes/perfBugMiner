only publish pre-trained model's checkpoint files are useless.

I can see there are some pre-trained models in the link below for download.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim
However, these are only checkpoint files. We can't use them at all. Because without .pbtxt file, which is the graph define, we can't restore the any model only base on .ckpt file. There are no example about how to use these checkpoint file, such as for a single image prediction or feature extraction. I can only see one example about how to use V3 .pb file for prediction, but that one is .pb file, not .ckpt file. Without .pbtxt file, we can't freeze the graph at all.
I want to use Inception V2 model, which is smaller than V3 and better than V1. However, I can do nothing...
even if you fine tune the model, you can only evaluate it base on a batch file, but not to predict single image. in the section of Evaluating performance of a model of the page, we can only get accuracy. However, we need to test single image to see the result, but not a accuracy number for a batch file.
