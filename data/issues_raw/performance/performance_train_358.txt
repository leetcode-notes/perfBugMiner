SWIG signature mismatch at RecordWriter

I tried to run the example "tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/reading_data/convert_to_records.py", but there is an error saying function signature mismatch on the bool WriteRecord(::tensorflow::StringPiece record); call.
My swig version is SWIG Version 1.3.40
A simple fix is to change bool WriteRecord(::tensorflow::StringPiece record); to bool WriteRecord(const string &record); for these two files,
tensorflow/tensorflow/python/lib/io/py_record_writer.h
tensorflow/tensorflow/python/lib/io/py_record_writer.cc
