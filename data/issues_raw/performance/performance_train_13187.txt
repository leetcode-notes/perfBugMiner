parse_example is awfully slow

@skearnes
you have indicated in this post of yours #390 way back in 2015 that parse_example is about 30 times faster than parse_single_example.
I have tried different options to modify my simple training script which only prints about 100000 tfrecords batched in 1000 and just does a print of feature and label after session.run(feature, label). Feature is a sparseTensor BTW.
Can you please put a test sample which proved that parse_example was that fast. parse_single_example was taking ~320 secs, now parse_example takes ~240 secs.
@admin, please do not close this issue and refer to stackoverflow, as I don't think this is something to do with API usage or wrong parameters.
This is to do with the performance of queues (enqueue, dequeue) & threads
