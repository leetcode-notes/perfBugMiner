A fix for error in tf.layers.conv3d_transpose when inferred batch size

Context
When using the tf.layers.conv3d_tranpose Op with a dynamic batch size and when use_bias=True then there is a well known error that occurs.
The error is due to a tf.reshape Op that chunks together some of the axes before adding the bias for a slight performance improvement.
E.g. in the case of data_format == 'channels_last',
outputs_4d = array_ops.reshape(outputs, [
            outputs_shape[0], outputs_shape[1],
            outputs_shape[2] * outputs_shape[3], outputs_shape[4]
        ])

gives an error when outputs_shape[0] == None, i.e. when batch size is inferred.
Simple fix
To fix this with minimal modification to other code, it would be great if someone could replace outputs_shape[0] with -1 in these two lines:
