Session run timeout causes memory leak and saving stuck

I am using distributed tensorflow, one of my machines was something wrong and caused almost all session run timeout, eventually memory reached 80G and been killed. This also caused worker0 process failed to save model, saver.save() stuck forever.
I am using 0.12.1 windows build. I searched and nobody ever reported issues like this. Any idea and advice to confirm and fix it?
