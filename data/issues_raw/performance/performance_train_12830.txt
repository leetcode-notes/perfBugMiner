Custom op linking flags

System information

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): not relevant

Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 7 cudnn 6
GPU model and memory: 1080 Ti
Exact command to reproduce: not relevant

Describe the problem
It is a feature request :)
I'm compiling TF from source (for optimal performance). And I need custom op so I'm following (https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op#compile_the_op_using_bazel_tensorflow_source_installation) by adding a bazel BUILD file in user_ops directory.
But at the same time my custom op needs some other libraries (like opencv). I could easily install opencv using my system's package manager and add a "-lopencv_xxx" flag during linking. Currently I hacked definition of tf_custom_op_library to add the extra linking flags. But I hope that (since I think this scenario is pretty common), tf_custom_op_library could expose something like extra_link_flags.
It should just be a few extra lines of code upstream. I could submit a PR if you think it's mergable
