Public head of master is failing windows CMAKE tests (?)

The following tests are failing for several of the public pull requests.  I suggest that the current head of master would also fail in the same way.
The following tests FAILED:
	171 - C:/tf_jenkins/home/workspace/tensorflow-pr-win-cmake-py/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/sparse_ops_test.py (Failed)
	173 - C:/tf_jenkins/home/workspace/tensorflow-pr-win-cmake-py/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/sparse_reshape_op_test.py (Failed)
