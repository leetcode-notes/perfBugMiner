Creating TensorFlow device issue and perfromance drop

Now I have 4 GeForce GTX TITAN X on my server. I want to run 4 tensor flow app independently on different GPU. I use the following code to assign GPU for different app, such as the 1st app use gpu:0 and 2nd app use gpu:1.
tf.device('/gpu:0')
However, whenever i run any app individually or all apps at same time, each app CMD window still outputs as below. Each creates 4 devices no matter other one(s) use these device or not.
After starting 3 apps, which are assigned the first 3 GPU (0,1,2) for each of them, then i start the 4th app for GPU:3, which is the 4th GPU, the app has dramatic performance drop.
Now i am using Ubuntu 16.04, cuda 8 + cuDNN 5.1. I do not know why this happen. I am not clear about if each app could run separately on different GPU on the same machine.
