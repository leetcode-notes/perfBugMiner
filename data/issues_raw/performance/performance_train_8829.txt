Tensorboard smoothing is not smooth at all.

I have Tensorflow v1.0.1 installed on Linux.
"Smoothed" Tensorboard looks not smooth at all compared to the original graph. For some reason it manages to find some interesting loss function behavior features that simply do not exist in the original loss data.
