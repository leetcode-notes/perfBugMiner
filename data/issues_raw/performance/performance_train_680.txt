Document parse_single_sequence_example

The docs are completely silent on parse_single_sequence_example, even though the (officially referenced) tf.train.Example protocol buffers documentation mentions SequenceExample, and the documentation for parse_single_sequence_example in the source code (parsing_ops.py) appears rather complete. I think just exposing the source code documentation would be very helpful to people. In general though SequenceExample could use better documentation as it's a very useful feature.
