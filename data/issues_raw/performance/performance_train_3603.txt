RC 0.10 3X Slower than 0.9 and Error Compiling From Source Under Certain Conditions

This issue is a follow-up to this posting on stack overflow. As noted, the 0.10 version is ~3x slower than version 0.9 for a particular training script I am using. The same slow-down is observed when using the pip version with CuDNN4 or with a version compiled from source and CuDNN 5.1.
I'm not sure what information about the training script would help. It is a fairly complex script that is training a network for object detection using methods similar to YOLO and SSD. It won't be possible to post the entire set of code, but if there is a way to isolate the source of the delay I may be able to modify it and post that portion.
While trying to get insight into the source of the slow-down I also noted that I wasn't able to compile from source using CuDNN4 as noted in the SO posting. This is a secondary issue, but may also warrant investigation.
