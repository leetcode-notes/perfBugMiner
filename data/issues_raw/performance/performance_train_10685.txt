You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Darwin / Mac OS X support for Intel's optional MKL optimizations. MKL appears to have darwin support, so I am unsure why it is not supported in Tensorflow. I imagine this is on a to-do, but a publicly tracked feature request might be helpful. Thank you.
