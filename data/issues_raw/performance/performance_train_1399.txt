Error using tf.image.random._ : 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'get_shape'

Intro
I am using a modified version of the Tensorflow tutorial "Deep MNIST for experts" with the Python API for a medical images classification project using convolutionnal networks.
I want to artificially increase the size of my training set by applying random modifications on the images of my training set.
Problem
When I run the line :
flipped_images = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(images)
I get de following error :

AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'get_shape'

My Tensor "images" is an ndarray (shape=[batch, im_size, im_size, channels]) of "batch" ndarrays (shape=[im_size, im_size, channels]).
Just to check if my input data was packed in the right shape and type, I have tried to apply this simple function in the (not modified) tutorial "Tensorflow Mechanics 101" and I get the same error.
Finally, I still get the same error trying to use the following functions :

tf.image.random_flip_up_down()
tf.image.random_brightness()
tf.image.random_contrast()

Questions
As input data is usually carried in Tensorflow as ndarrays, I would like to know :

Is it a bug of Tensorflow Python API or is it my "fault" because
of the type/shape of my input data?
How could I get it to work and be able to apply    "tf.image.random_flip_left_right" to my training set?
