Feature Request: tf.assign() support tuples

I have recently updated to V1.3 of Tensorflow.  I have some code that I use for dynamic_rnn which copies the STATE of the cell so it persists to the next .run(), I can also INIT that value as well.  Since the update, I am getting a "WARNING:tensorflow:<tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl.LSTMCell object at 0x7f278c196940>: Using a concatenated state is slower and will soon be deprecated.  Use state_is_tuple=True.".  I have tried to enable state_is_tuple but then the assign() commands fail as they don't support the tuple structures.
I have an open StackOverflow question with the details:

Since it seems like the RNN core is moving in the direction of the tuple for the state, it would be nice if the .assign() can handle this transparently.
