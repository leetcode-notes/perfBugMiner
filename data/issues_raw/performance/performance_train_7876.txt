If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    initializer = tf.random_uniform_initializer(minval=-0.5, maxval=0.5, seed=42, dtype=tf.float32)
    var1 = tf.get_variable('var1', shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float32, initializer=initializer)
    saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.trainable_variables(), max_to_keep=20)
    init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
    graph.finalize()

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    saver.save(sess, 'sample_graph', global_step=0)

graph = tf.Graph()
with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('sample_graph-0.meta')
    saver.restore(sess, './sample_graph-0')
    saver.save(sess, 'sample_graph', global_step=1)
    print(saver.last_checkpoints) # lists only ['sample_graph-1'] does not preserve the previous checkpoint sample_graph-0
Essentially I am checkpointing a graph and then importing it. On trying to save the next checkpoint, the saver overwrites the previous checkpoint in the checkpoint file (the actual meta, index and data files are not overwritten) and only the last saved checkpoint is present in the checkpoint file. Is this the intended behavior? Is there any way to preserve the checkpoints across multiple saves of the graph.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
