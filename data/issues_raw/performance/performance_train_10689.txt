Tensorflow build fails with -mavx512f

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Fedora 25
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): latest commit f58e6ce , happens with older versions as well (23caaa5, f48673b, 9a15e0a, 3c4cb08 to only name a few)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: none
CPU model and memory: XEON PHI 7250, 96GiB ram
Exact command to reproduce:
./configure
specify optimization flags: -mavx512f
bazel  build --config=opt --verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
Building Tensorflow from source fails when avx512 instructions are activated.
After managing to compile most of the source the build fails somewhere in the eigen part of the code.

Don't let yourself get thrown off by the "MKL" in some path names, its just the name of the virtualenv, for this report MKL was turned off in the configure.
