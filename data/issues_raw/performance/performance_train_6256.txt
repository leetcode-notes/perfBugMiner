grpc worker->client fetch tops out at 120 MB/s

Fetching data as numpy arrays is slow for grpc sessions. Evaluating 128MB variable repeatedly from Session("grpc://localhost..") only gets me 116 MB/s, compared to 5150MB/s for Session()

python client_transfer_benchmark.py --profile
5150.04 MB per second
116.70 MB per second


Attached are CPU profiles for worker and for client. Worker uses 2x CPU and both of them are spending majority of the time in in gRPC code, specifically doing strcmp (reported as __nss_hosts_lookup).

This is related but slightly different from #6116 -- that issue looks at worker->worker transfer which hits 520 MB/second for the same message size (degrading below 100 MB/second for larger messages)
