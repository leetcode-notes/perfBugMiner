Fatal error in TileOps: invalid combination

I have an RNN I adapted from the PTB example that works fine on CPU.  But when I try to run it on a GPU, it dies with:
F tensorflow/core/kernels/tile_ops.cc:131] TileOp: Invalid combination of Device, DT and NDIM: N5Eigen9GpuDeviceE, float, 0
I'm guessing this is complaining about a 0-dimensional tensor?  What's going on?
