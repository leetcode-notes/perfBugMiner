Upgrade to libjpeg-turbo

TensorFlow seems to be using the classic libjpeg v 0.9, but libjpeg-turbo is heavily optimized to leverage SIMD on various platforms (x86, ARM, POWER, etc.), and is both API and ABI compatible with libjpeg, at least up to libjpeg 0.8. Given TensorFlow's goal of portability across a wide varierty of platforms, I'm wondering if libjpeg was decided upon instead of libjpeg-turbo for portability, or was this just an omission?
libjpeg-turbo speeds up JPEG decoding by about 2x, and since that reduces decoding latency and increases throughput, it not only improves performance of TensorFlow on the CPU, but especially on the GPU, which tends to wait for the CPU to provide decoded images. Moreover, that could result in a major performance improvement on more CPU-underpowered platforms such as ARM (e.g. via NEON SIMD on the NVIDIA TX1 platform which uses the NEON-capable Cortex A57, or on ARM Cortex A8 on a Samsung Galaxy S).
