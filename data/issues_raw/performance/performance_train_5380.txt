'tensorflow/core/public/session.h' file not found

I didn't find anything about this problem. I'm creating the python package from the source with bazel, the commands used are the same of the official guide in the section create pip package.
The file .whl generated is working but doesn't have some include files that I use in a new op created in C++. The missing files are session_options.h and session.h which, however, are present in the official .whl of tensorflow that you can download (the binary package pre-compiled).
To add those files I had to insert some requirements in tensorflow/core/BUILD:

Is it normal or I missed some configuration during the building? I could not fix it without this additions.

If you try to import a graph as you can see in the guide you need to require the header: #include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h".
