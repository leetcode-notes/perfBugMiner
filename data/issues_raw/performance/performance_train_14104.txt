tf.scatter_add causes error in loop

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOSX
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee 1.3.0
Python version:  3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: no CUDA
GPU model and memory: no GPU
Exact command to reproduce:

Describe the problem
I found very strange behavior of tf.scatter_add: I created a tf.while_loop that creates a Tensor wrapped inside a tf.Variable. If I don't add something to the Variable outside the loop, tensorflow causes an error telling me that the Variable is not mutable.
I asked the on StackOverflow and was told to create a bug report.

Uncommenting the commented line removes the error. But I don't think this is intended behavior.
