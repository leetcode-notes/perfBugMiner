contrib.layers.avg_pool2d raises warnings when serializing metagraph

System information

Overview of problem
Since updating to the most recent version (as of yesterday) of TensorFlow, I've started seeing the following ominous warning when serializing a wide resnet variant that I've been using for acoustic modeling:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing LAYER_NAME_UIDS.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
'dict' object has no attribute 'name'

However, a metagraphdef does export and I am able to successfully use it to recreate the trained model. After playing around with simpler architectures, it looks like the problem comes from the average pooling I do at the end, which involves a call to tf.contrib.layers.avg_pool2d. For a trivial example that elicits this warning, please see the script at
