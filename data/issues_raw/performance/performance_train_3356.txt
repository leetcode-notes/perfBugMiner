can't construct gradient of gradient

In general, I've had no trouble constructing the gradient of a gradient in Tensorflow, but I hit on a weird edge case involving complex numbers where I couldn't.  Below, I show a case where the double gradient works, and one that is minimally different where it doesn't.
Here's where double gradient works:
x = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))
xx = x * x
g = tf.gradients(tf.reduce_sum(xx), x)
h = tf.gradients(tf.reduce_sum(g), x)
As expected, evaluating h produces:
>>> sess.run(h, feed_dict={x:10*[1.]})
[array([ 2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.], dtype=float32)]

Here's where double gradient doesn't work:
x = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))
xx = tf.real(tf.complex(x*x, tf.zeros([10])))
g = tf.gradients(tf.reduce_sum(xx), x)
h = tf.gradients(tf.reduce_sum(g), x)
Running the last line gives:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

I'm running version 0.9.0, CPU only, in OS X.
