Update Cmake minimum requirement to v3.5

As it seems to have appeared an issue with Cmake 3.3 and the minimum known working Cmake version apparently is 3.5 (see here). Should the minimum requirement be updated on CmakeLists to 3.5 and the readme for minimum 3.5 up to 3.6?
If those changes look relevant and are the ones to be made I could update them and submit a PR.
