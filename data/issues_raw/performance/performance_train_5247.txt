tensorboard demos don't work because of wrong paths

Checked on commit 32d1dcc.
Issue:
While going through tensorboard/DEVELOPMENT.MD it is not possible to have tensorboard's demos working as demo's html as well as components htmls import other html with wrong file names.
For example in:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/demo/index.html
there is an import of ../components/tf-tensorboard/tf-tensorboard.html and in fact this file doesn't exist. It exist under slightly different file name with replaced "-" with "_" (../components/tf_tensorboard/tf-tensorboard.html)
The difference is in directory names.
The same occurs if I want to load particular component's demo.
