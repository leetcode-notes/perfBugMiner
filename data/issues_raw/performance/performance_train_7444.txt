If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
v = tf.Variable(0., dtype=tf.float32, trainable=True)

tf.contrib.tfprof.model_analyzer.print_model_analysis(tf.get_default_graph())
This will show total_parameters of 0, despite there being a parameter.

I believe this is coming from the logic here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.0.0-rc2/tensorflow/tools/tfprof/internal/tfprof_show.cc#L37 which skips nodes with empty shapes, which includes scalars.
