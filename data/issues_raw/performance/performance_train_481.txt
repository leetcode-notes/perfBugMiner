Error Running cifar10_train.py in Ver 0.6.0

The cifar-10 demo ran fine under 0.5.0 but gives errors under 0.6.0 (I rolled back to 0.5.0 and confirmed this). Also cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py works under 0.6.0 as well as 0.5.0.  The output I'm getting when running cifar10_train.py in 0.6.0 is attached. I'm running under Ubuntu 14.04.
