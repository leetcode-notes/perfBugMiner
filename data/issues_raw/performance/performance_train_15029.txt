build tensorflow Image Recognition with c++

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.6.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0
GPU model and memory:5.4.0
Exact command to reproduce:

I follow this tutorial try to build a a c++ tensorflow program.
Here is the steps:

build tensorflow from source. I am sure this step is right, because I can install python tensorflow with the whl file built by this step.
in the tensorflow source code directory, I run this command:

bazel build tensorflow/examples/label_image/...
the build failed with following logs(partial, because whole log is too big)
