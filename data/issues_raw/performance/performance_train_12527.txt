Optimize non_max_suppression by iterating backwards

In typical scenarios, high-overlapping boxes are likely to have similar scores.
Therefore if there are any high-overlapping boxes, it's faster to find them starting from boxes that have similar scores.
This simple heuristic improves performance of the op on several actual workload by 10%~20%. The workloads are like ~10k boxes produced by a region proposal network.
