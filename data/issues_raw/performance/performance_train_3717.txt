Undefined Inputs on MatMul in Trace File (GPU Only)

I am still working on solving my performance issue with a Reinforcement Learning system as stated in #3320 and have a question about reading the trace files in Chrome with "chrome:trace".
I am trying to debug and speed up my graph.  I am seeing multiple copies of some of the graph ops with "undefined" for both inputs for MatMul when GPU is in use, but not for CPU.  This seems to be the only Op I see this "undefined" input value.
For example, "taking_action/mydnn/DNNLayer_1/MatMul" has 3 MatMul.  1 with the appropriate inputs and 2 copies with "undefined" inputs.  Is this expected or do I have a problem with my graph?  Are the 2 "undefined" some optimization of the original "MatMul"?

EDIT: Using the latest HEAD, 0.10.0 RC
