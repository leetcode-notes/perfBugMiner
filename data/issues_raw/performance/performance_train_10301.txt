TensorBoard Embeddings fail if a "+" character is in LOG_DIR subdirectory filename

System information

Occurs in Tutorial: DandelionMane's TF Dev Summit 2017 TensorBoard Tutorial

If learning_rate >= 1 (not that you would want to do that)


OS Platform: Windows 10
TensorFlow install: Binary
TensorFlow version: 1.1.0
Exact command to reproduce: Use a plus sign in the filename of one of LOG_DIR's subdirectories

Problem
The tensorboard embeddings tab throws an "Error fetching projector config" if a + sign is used in a log_dir subdirectory; that is, if the projector_config.pbtxt is in that subdirectory.
