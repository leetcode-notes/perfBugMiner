runtime error of combing tensorflow CTC and SynthText

Hi,
I met a runtime error during training when I tried to applied tensorflow built-in CTC loss function  (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn/conectionist_temporal_classification__ctc_) to SynthText dataset. http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/
It said " Not enough time for target transition sequence (required: 4, available: 0)".
Here is the some info for environment: tensorflow version '0.12.0-rc0'.
I am able to apply tensorflow built-in CTC to Synth90K Dataset with great performance (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/).
It seems like the SynthText dataset is not compilable with tensorflow built-in CTC but Synth90K Dataset could.
Please find the error message as reference
