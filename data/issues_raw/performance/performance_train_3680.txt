error: can't copy 'tensorflow/models/embedding/gen_word2vec.py': doesn't exist

I was installing TF from source like I always did but I'm having the following issue this time when running bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg I got
~/python/tensorflow$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

error: can't copy 'tensorflow/models/embedding/gen_word2vec.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file
plus, I can't find that file anywhere... did anything change or am I missing something?
