Tensorflow not working in Zeppelin 0.7.0

There seems to be some issue using Tensorflow in Zeppelin 0.7.0 and it throws this error:
NameError: name _interactive is not defined
Another user reported the same issue on SO. The fix suggested there seems to be really hacky.
The issue seems to be that in tf_logging.py file [.\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\platform\tf_logging.py] the _interactive variable is not triggering for Zeppelin.
# Determine whether we are in an interactive environment
try:
  # This is only defined in interactive shells
  if _sys.ps1: _interactive = True
except AttributeError:
  # Even now, we may be in an interactive shell with `python -i`.
  _interactive = _sys.flags.interactive
