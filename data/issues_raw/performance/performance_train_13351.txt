TensorFlow variable initializers broken

Three symptoms observed with models after upgrading tensorflow:

must feed placeholder error
or
things hang with 100% utilization inside python _build_initializer_expr
things succeed but sess.run call takes 100x slower than before

I believe this is due to this commit:
07adc2e
Because the following work-around restores good behavior:
from tensorflow.python.ops import variables
def passthrough(obj, value): return value
try:
  variables.Variable._build_initializer_expr=passthrough
except: # older versions of TF don't have this
  pass

Here's a self contained repro: https://github.com/yaroslavvb/stuff/blob/master/tf_initializer_bug_report.py
It works fine in tensorflow 1.2, or with the fix, in latest version is throws
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: You must feed a va
lue for placeholder tensor 'Wf_holder' with dtype float and shape [307328]
         [[Node: Wf_holder = Placeholder[dtype=DT_FLOAT, shape=[307328], _device
="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0"]()]]


Sorry I didn't make the repro smaller, I lost motivation after finding the quick fix :)
