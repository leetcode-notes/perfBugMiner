sigmoid cross entropy doesn't verify shapes

Hello,
I have found a misleading behaviour in sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits function. If I pass a tensor of shape (n, 1) as logits and a tensor of shape (n,) as targets it outputs a tensor of (n, n) which is obviously different from tensor (n,) if both tensors have the same shape (n,). Although api docs say that logits and targets must have the same shape, this example doesn't fail properly nor broadcast correctly.
