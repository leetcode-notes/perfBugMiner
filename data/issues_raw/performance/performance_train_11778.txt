Bug in ctc_ops.py 's documentation

see in
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/ctc_ops.py#L201
it says the inputs is logits, but from the op test https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/ctc_decoder_ops_test.py#L111
we can see the input should be log probability .
Although seems this does not affect the decoder's output, but it affects the decoder's return of path's log_prob, and the discribe of neg_sum_logits is confusing.
I think the document should be changed, the inputs should be log of probabilities and the output should be -log(p), maybe we can transform the output to p with tf.exp(-p), i think probability output is more comfortable
and confusing people from another issue #6034
