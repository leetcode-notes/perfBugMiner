l2_normalize broken in master

tf.nn.l2_normalize(tf.constant(np.ones([2, 2, 2, 2])), [0, 1, 2]) crashes with the following error:
ValueError: Shape (1, 3) must have rank at most 1
The problem is that l2_normalize function converts the dimension list into [[0, 1, 2]] (double brackets) and it stopped being supported recently. It works fine in 0.10 branch as far as I can tell.
Shorter repro to get the same error:
tf.reduce_sum(tf.constant(np.ones([2, 2, 2, 2])), [[0, 1, 2]])
