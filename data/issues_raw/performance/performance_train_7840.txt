fused batch norm delay_updates confusion

In https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py around line 347:
From its definition, delay_updates should delay updates to moving mean and moving average if we are training.
The way it is defined now, when is_training evaluates to Trure, smart_cond will pick the _delay_updates function which actually adds the update ops to the graph. Is that intended ?
