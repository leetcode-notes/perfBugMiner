partial_run can't do incremental feeds in InteractiveSession

Here is a section of code copied from the docstring of partial_run, with required import statements added. However, note that this constructs an InteractiveSession instead of a Session.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.python.ops import array_ops, math_ops
from tensorflow.python import dtypes
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

a = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
b = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
c = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
r1 = math_ops.add(a, b)
r2 = math_ops.mul(r1, c)

h = sess.partial_run_setup([r1, r2], [a, b, c])
res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})
res = sess.partial_run(h, r2, feed_dict={c: res})
The code fails with a NotFoundError. When the InteractiveSession is replaced by a normal Session, the code runs correctly. The difference between the two is that the interactive session sets the place_pruned_graph option to True (starting a plain Session with place_pruned_graph=True reproduces the issue.)
I do all of my work in an interactive terminal, and I would find it useful to have partial_run work correctly in this setting.
