tfdbg ps -b command does not work on Windows

Issue:
The tfdbg ps -b command does not annotate the source file source file beginning at the given line i.e. the output of ps -b 10 source.py is the same as ps source.py.
Steps to reproduce:

Open the command prompt
Run python -m tensorflow.python.debug.examples.debug_mnist --debug
Press r
Type ps -b 10 path/to/debug_mnist
