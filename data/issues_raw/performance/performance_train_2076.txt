Including timestamp with tf.Print?

I'm trying to implement a batched version of the Inception example for TensorFlow Serving, and I'd like to benchmark the performance.
Is it possible to have tf.Print emit a timestamp along with the logging information? Particularly if the op is bundled via tensorflow_serving.session_bundle.exporter?
I think it's possible to do with:
x = tf.Print(x, [x], "(%s) Obtained: " % asctime())
although I'm not sure if this will work appropriately when exported.
