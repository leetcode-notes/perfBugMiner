Feature request: (documentation) operation complexity / performance chart

Have I written custom code: NA
OS Platform and Distribution: Any
TensorFlow installed from: NA
TensorFlow version: NA
Bazel version: NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: NA

It would be interesting to have a complexity/performance chart for different operations. For example, to know that tf.reshape is computationally cheaper than tf.transpose.
I did see the Performance Guide, but that's not what I mean.
