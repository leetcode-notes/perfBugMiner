Describe the problem
I was just trying to make a classifier iOS app by simply replacing the inception pb file to my pb file for my classifier.
The iOS app example I was using is camera. It worked well with the original inception.
But when I changed the pb file I got an error as listed below. The pb file was generated with tensorflow-for-poest-2.
Then the model doesn't work. The camera is working but no classification message.
I assume there is some mismatch between versions of TF?
