Tensorflow causes whole python to crash with error Python frozen importlib._bootstrap

If I try to run a computer vision script python crashes with no error message at all.
If I run with python -m trace python console goes in loop with a message repeated continuously that is unreadable because lines are printed endless too fastly. I can see some line related to sre_compile.py text_format.py inspect.py and charmap codec can't encode \u2713 in cp1252.py and from tensorflow.contrib.keras
If I try to redirect the output to a file, the file content is
<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(376): <frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(1258): <frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(1255): <frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(1256):  --- modulename: _bootstrap_external, funcname: _path_join
<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(59): <frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>(60):  --- modulename: _bootstrap_external, funcname: <listcomp>
...again and again

This isn't the first time that a tensorflow issue cause the whole python to go crazy.
I have tried both today nightly build, past days nightly build, stable version, no way to run and since causes python crash It's very hard to debug.
Tensorflow stable and nightly 1.0.1 on windows 10 x64.
To reproduce this issue run evaluate.py scipt of TensorBox project
