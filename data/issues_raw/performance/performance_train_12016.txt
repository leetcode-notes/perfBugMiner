A single value placeholder cause an GPU memory warning.

I train my model on GTX 980 with 4 GB memory. The tensorflow version is 1.1.0. Python is 3.6.0.
The example code is on this GitHub link (https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf). Since the code is kind of long, I do not want to copy them. IF someone can run it, I will appreciate it.
The problem is when I increase the epoch, It cause a memory error on my GPU. But, when delete the variable placeholder "self.dropout_keep_prob", there would be no error message. I do not know why, my code running on CPU is totally fine.
Below is the warning message:
2017-08-03 15:38:52.537616: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/bfc_allocator.cc:217] Allocator (GPU_0_bfc) ran out of memory trying to allocate 3.84GiB. The caller indicates that this is not a failure, but may mean that there could be performance gains if more memory is available.
