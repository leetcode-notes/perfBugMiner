conv2d / Kernel Size > Input does not raise ValueError anymore

I noticed that tensorflow 0.10.0 raises a ValueError when I pass a kernel size that is larger than the first input dimensions. The error occurred when I tried to pass data in NCHW format, while the default data_format is NHWC.
I used this code for replication of the problem:
import tensorflow as tf

# NHWC
input_nhwc = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 84, 84, 4])
output_nhwc = tf.contrib.layers.conv2d(input_nhwc, 32, [8, 8], 4)

# NCHW
input_nchw = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 4, 84, 84])
output_nchw = tf.contrib.layers.conv2d(input_nchw, 32, [8, 8], 4)

tensorflow 0.12.1 does not raise any error, whereas tensorflow 0.10.0 raises the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: Filter must not be larger than the input: Filter: (8, 8) Input: (4, 84)

I tried to track if there's any kind of automatic detection of data formats (there is not), and further why the issue persists. All I could find were the filter and input shapes in nn_ops.py, which seem to pass compability tests in tensorflow 0.12.0.
NHWC
Filter shape: (8, 8, 4, 32) | input shape: (?, 84, 84, 4)
----------------
NCHW
Filter shape: (8, 8, 84, 32) | input shape: (?, 4, 84, 84)

I'm not sure if this is expected behavior, or if an exception should have been raised in tensorflow 0.12.1 as well.
