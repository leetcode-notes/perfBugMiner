mnist_with_summaries does not produce node statistics

System information

Windows 7 Enterprise 64
TF 1.1.0 installed from pip
CUDA 8.0/cuDNN 5.1.5
GeForce GTX TITAN X
command: python mnist_with_summaries.py

Describe the problem
In https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz, mnist_with_summaries is given as an illustration of how to use tensorboard to show node statistics. However, it does not produce node statistics on my computer. Everything else is working correctly (the graph is there, summaries as well, the training goes smoothly).
