TensorBoard doesn't show Events on TensorFlow v0.10 RC

After a clean install of TensorFlow v0.10 (from master) my TensorBoard is suddenly broken. The scalar event plots do not show upon clicking (see screenshow below). While the logs in the terminal do not show any errors, the Chrome Developer console shows the following error upon opening a figure:
tf-tensorboard.html:1517 Uncaught Error: tf-chart-scaffold's content doesn't implement the required interfaceinsertBefore @ VM2478 polymer-mini.html:560

I am running Chrome Version 52.0.2743.116 (64-bit) on Linux Mint 17.
