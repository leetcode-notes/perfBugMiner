Quantized inception-resnet-v2 doesn't predict the images correctly

I did quantization on inception-resnet-v2 model using https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/quantization#how_can_you_quantize_your_models. Size of freezed graph(input for quantization) is 224,6 MB and quantized graph is 58,6 MB. I ran some tests for quantized graph and the predicted output is totally wrong. I ran accuracy test for certain dataset wherein, for freezed graph the accuracy is 97.4% whereas for quantized graph it is 0%.
Is there a different way to quantize the model for inception-resnet versions? or, for inception-resnet model, quantization is not support at all?
