Windows 10 -> tensorflow-gpu -> TCC mode = Hangs forever

Anybody getting this to work in windows while in TCC CUDA mode? Seems to work fine in WDDM driver mode but WDDM cripples performance. To replicate issue, run on machine with Tesla class GPU in TCC mode, then try to create a session (sess = tf.Session()). The python process consumes a CPU core indefinitely and the session is never created.
