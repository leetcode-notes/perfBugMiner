Update Performance guide compiler recommendation for macOS users

Hi!
As per the Performance guide I tried to build TF from source using gcc version 4.8.3+ on a MacBook.  I tried gcc 4.9 and 6.3 (Homebrew versions).  I got the following errors (same errors for 6.3):

gcc-4.9: error: unrecognized command line option '-fcolor-diagnostics'
gcc-4.9: error: unrecognized command line option '-Wthread-safety'
gcc-4.9: error: unrecognized command line option '-Wself-assign'

According to one of the last years issues with the same errors, this is due to the fact that

We generally use the default of clang for OS X compilation, which explains your error. When I run gcc --version I get Apple LLVM version 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81). You should try switching to clang instead of gcc, since that's the supported approach.

If this is still the case and all macOS users should stick to clang, could you please update the performance guide accordingly?
Best,
Andrei
