gather_nd bounds checking not working

When using gather_nd, sometimes out-of-bounds indices lead to errors (bounds checking -- the expected behavior) and sometimes it seems to just read zeros. I expect it reading just other memory from the GPU, but I've never observed anything other than zeros so I'm not sure. When I run on the CPU the bounds seem to be appropriately checked i.e. I get the errors desired. Here's some example code:
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.zeros([5,5,5]) + 1, [[6,6,6]])))
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.zeros([1,5]) + 1, [-50000000000000000])))
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.reshape(tf.range(5*5*5), [5,5,5]), [[6,6,6]])))
The first two print statements execute successfully, which is a bug: the indices are clearly out of range, and the arrays are clearly all 1's; but instead it returns an appropriately shaped array of 0's. (The +1 is not necessary to trigger the bug, but highlights that it's drawing from incorrect memory). The third line, for some reason, has the bounds checking operate correctly, and says that -- yes -- the index [6,6,6] is not in the bounds. It appears to something based on what the previous op is, maybe? Where some ops, such as stack, allow me to go outside the bounds, while others such as reshape don't. Here's an example interactive session to show the output I get.
