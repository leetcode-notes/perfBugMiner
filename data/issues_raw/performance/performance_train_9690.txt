Make EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES available from Python

Removing unnecessary memcpys when feeding a Numpy array with a feed_dict is a recurring feature request that has large performance implications.
From what I can tell, @alextp implemented changes that avoid the memcpy if the input array is EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES aligned. For a user to definitely avoid memcpy's on feeding, they would need to make sure their arrays are aligned to EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES. Currently, there is no way to access EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES from Python, so the user can't be sure what alignment is required.
It would be nice if there was a C API call (and a corresponding Python one) to make EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES available. This isn't a critical feature as the user can currently be very pessimistic on alignment requirements and (probably safely) 64-byte align their inputs.
