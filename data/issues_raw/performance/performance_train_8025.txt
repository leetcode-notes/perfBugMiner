quantize_graph round and quantize modes are broken

Looking at code in master. /CC @petewarden
A KeyError is always produced.
Consider the round mode:
    if self.mode == "round":
      self.already_visited = {}
      for output_node in output_nodes:
        self.round_nodes_recursively(output_node)
which will fails for all calls:
  def round_nodes_recursively(self, current_node):
    """The entry point for simple rounding quantization."""
    if self.already_visited[current_node.name]:

with a key error since the already_visited dict will be empty.
