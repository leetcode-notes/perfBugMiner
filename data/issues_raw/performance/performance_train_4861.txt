What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
An example in the code base does not work with the docker image. It is the opinion of the filer that all examples should run without any need for configuration on the docker image because the project has control over what is installed on the docker image.

Environment info
Operating System:
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:

NONE, CPU based container
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".

# python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"
0.11.0rc0


If installed from source, provide

Not installed from source

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Example given at beginning of ticket.

What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Removed all references to sklearn. Application works.
# It's useful to scale to ensure Stochastic Gradient Descent will do the right thing
#scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
#X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
#X_test = scaler.fit_transform(X_test)
