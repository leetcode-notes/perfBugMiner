Hard-coding "1" for CUDA version breaks existing MacOS GPU build with CUDA 7.5

Commit f45874b broke existing GPU builds on MacOS with CUDA 7.5
It nows fails
I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:1078] failed to find libcuda.so on this system: Failed precondition: could not dlopen DSO: libcuda.1.dylib; dlerror: dlopen(libcuda.1.dylib, 5): image not found
A work-around is to create a symlink
cd /usr/local/cuda/lib/
ln -s libcuda.dylib libcuda.1.dylib
