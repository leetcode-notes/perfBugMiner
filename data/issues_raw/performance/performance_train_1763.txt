image processing functions should not convert dtypes unless necessary (e.g. resize/crop/transpose/rotate, ...)

Environment info
Operating System: OSX
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

package: tensorflow
version: 0.7.1

Steps to reproduce
Perform a resize action on a decoded jpeg before passing it to convert_image_dtype with a target of float32.  The values will still be in the range 0-255 rather than 0-1.
This line works as expected
tf.image.convert_image_dtype(tf.image.decode_jpeg(value, channels=3), tf.float32)
This line doesn't(values in the tensor are still 0-255 rather than 0-1)
tf.image.convert_image_dtype(tf.resize_images(tf.image.decode_jpeg(value, channels=3), x, y), tf.float32)
What have you tried?

Changing the order as described above works.
