[ Bug ] The 2nd Saver fails to recognize its Checkpoint State file.

Operating System: macOS Sierra
Steps to Reproduce:

In a session, create two Savers.
Let one of the Saver save the variables.
Let the other Saver save the variables in a different directory from the first Saver's destination directory.

Result:
An Info message is displayed indicating that a Checkpoint State file does not exist (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py#L738). And TensorFlow creates a new Checkpoint State file. This happens every time the 2nd Saver saves the variables.
Expected Result:
The 2nd Saver's Checkpoint State file should be recognized.
Code to Reproduce:
with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    ...
    saver_best = tf.train.Saver()
    saver_hourly = tf.train.Saver(max_to_keep=None)  
    ...
    for i in range(max_step):
        ...
        if last_hourly_save + datetime.timedelta(hours=1) < datetime.datetime.now():                     
            path_checkpoint_file = saver_hourly.save(sess, 'checkpoint_directory/hourly/model', global_step=i, latest_filename='hourly_checkpoint')
        ...
        if best:
            path_checkpoint_file = saver_best.save(sess, 'checkpoint_directory/best/model', global_step=i, latest_filename='best_checkpoint')
        ...
