Refactored GPU installation from source issue (Ubuntu 16.04)

It looks like the GPU installation from source got refactored and is failing to compile on my Ubuntu 16.04, CUDA 8.0, cuDNN 5.0, with GTX 1080 GPU.
I had the GTX 1080 working with the build from a few days ago, but just pulled from the head and now cannot compile so I am not sure if this is the auto_configure for the GPU or not I saw going though.
$ git rev-parse HEAD

$ bazel version
Build label: 0.3.1
Build target: bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/BazelServer_deploy.jar

$ ./configure

$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package  1>~/initial_output.txt 2>&1
initial_output.txt
GPU CUDA includes were not found so I added line to new file: CROSSTOOL.tpl @ line 66
cxx_builtin_include_directory: "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include"
$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package  1>~/second_output.txt 2>&1
second_output.txt
I think it is complaining about not finding "crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc".
I did a "locate" and my version seems to be at the following:
$ locate crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc
/home/greg/serving/tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc
/home/greg/serving/tf_models/syntaxnet/tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc
/home/greg/tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.tpl
Let me know where the file is that has the path to the crosstool_wrapper.... and I can update the path to test that as a fix unless you know the root cause...
EDIT: BTW, the build works fine without the GPU configuration
