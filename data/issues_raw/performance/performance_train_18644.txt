TensorBoard not running correctly with TF 1.8.0-rc0

Hi, I upgraded TF to 1.8.0-rc0 to use the new tf.data.prefetch_to_device() feature. But with this version tensorboard won't run well. Here is output when I run tensorboard.

(The command was valid when I entered with TF 1.7.)
Also when I entered to the tensorboard on the browser, tensorboard page opened but no event was displayed.

Environment info
TF version: ('v1.7.0-1569-g3970b47da5', '1.8.0-rc0')
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.3
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7 but I guess it's not CUDA related.
The latest version of TensorBoard is still 1.7.0, so there might be a reason for the problem.
Thank you for your hard working :^)
