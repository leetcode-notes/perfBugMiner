Word2vec overflows int32 corpus_size_

Hello, I'm trying to build a big word model, and I'm getting overflows in the corpus_size_ declared here

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec_kernels.cc
    
    
         Line 119

           int32 corpus_size_ = 0; 
        
    
  


The error is being thrown here:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/models/embedding/word2vec_kernels.cc

           return errors::InvalidArgument("The text file ", filename, 
        
    
  


Because negative numbers are less than positive numbers. I'm going to change them to uint64 in my own build, if it doesn't cause problems should I make a PR?
