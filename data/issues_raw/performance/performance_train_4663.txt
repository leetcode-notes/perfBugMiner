Control dependency on identity containing assign not working

I'm running Tensorflow 0.10.
The following code
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(0, dtype=tf.int32)

old_val = tf.identity(x)
with tf.control_dependencies([old_val]):
    new_val = tf.assign(x, x + 1)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())

    for i in xrange(3):
        print sess.run([old_val, new_val, x])
outputs
[1, 1, 1]
[2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3]

From reading the docs on control_dependencies and identity as well as StackOverflow, I expected output
[0, 1, ?]
[1, 2, ?]
[2, 3, ?]

where ? indicates that the variable value is unspecified.
Is this a bug? If this is not a bug, what is the correct way to refer to the value of variable before and after assignment in a single graph?
