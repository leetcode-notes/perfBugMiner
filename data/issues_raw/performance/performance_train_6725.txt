Environment info
Operating System:
Mac
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
0.12.1

If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
The output of bazel version

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Try to compile/run (with latest 0.12.1 TF):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/tensorflow/examples/learn/text_classification_character_rnn.py
This causes error:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.rnn' has no attribute 'GRUCell'
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Looks like GRUCell got moved from tensorflow.contrib.rnn to tf.nn.rnn_cell.RNNCell.  I tried making this change to the example code, but this leads to other errors.  It looks like the signature changed too.
