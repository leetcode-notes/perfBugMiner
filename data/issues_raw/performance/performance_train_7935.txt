Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 / Windows
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: NO
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". 1.0

If installed from source, provide NO
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators import kmeans as kmeans_lib
from tensorflow.contrib.factorization.python.ops import clustering_ops
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf


def input_fn(x):
"""Returns an input_fn"""
def _fn():
       return tf.constant(x), None
return _fn

x = np.array([[random.random() for i in range(198)] for j in range(2384)], dtype=np.float32)
km = kmeans_lib.KMeansClustering(num_clusters=200, initial_clusters=clustering_ops.KMEANS_PLUS_PLUS_INIT)
km.fit(input_fn=input_fn(x), max_steps=300)

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Hi, I found following 2 lines missing in gen_clustering_ops.py. I believe they should there in the file. If not then please raise a bug.  I couldn't find the correct place where the change is to be made
