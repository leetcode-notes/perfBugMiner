Wrong path for absolute variable scopes

Using absolute paths for scopes is useful when structuring large models.
We can enter a name scope from its absolute path by appending a slash:
with tf.name_scope('foo'):
  with tf.name_scope('bar/') as scope:
    print(tf.constant(0).name)  # bar/Const:0
    print(bar)  # bar
However, this does not work with variable scopes:
with tf.variable_scope('foo'):
  with tf.variable_scope('bar/') as bar:
    print(tf.constant(0).name)  # bar/Const:0
    print(bar.name)  # foo/bar/ (Expected: bar)
The last line should print bar instead of foo/bar/.
