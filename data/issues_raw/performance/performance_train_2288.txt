NaN checker does not check outputs of optimizers

Hi,
I noticed this while debugging fp16 support for the Adam optimizer, so I thought I'd write it down here before it was forgotten.
I had problems with NaNs in my pipeline, but couldn't really figure out where they came from. So I called tf.add_check_numerics_ops(), but it turns out that if the Adam optimizer creates a NaN (in my case, because the default epsilon of 1e-8 was too small for fp16), it is not actually checked.
Instead, you get the error on a later Read op (when the NaN is attempted used), which can be very confusing, especially since there's a lot of Read ops and it's not always easy to figure out which one the error message is about.
