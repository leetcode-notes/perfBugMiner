Python Tools Missing

The tools found under tensorflow/python/tools are not packaged along with the pip package making them only usable through bazel (as demonstrated in their header documentation).  It's not clear to me how bazel is told which bits of python should be part of the pip package but these would be very useful to have access to from python code (ie: optimize_for_inference_lib).
