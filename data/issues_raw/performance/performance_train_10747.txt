Striding behaviour different between caffe and tensorflow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary (pip install)
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d', '1.2.0')
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla P100-SXM2 16MB
Exact command to reproduce: python caffe_to_tf_test.py

Describe the problem
Caffe convolution produce different results then tensorflow with the same parameters.   This has something to do with striding - the attached test fails with striding equal to 2, and succeeds with striding equal to 1.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
