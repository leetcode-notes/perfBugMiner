Tensorboard scalar summary graph distorts after resizing and toggling log scale on y-axis

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
None although a search for distorted image tensorboard doesn't help much...

Steps to reproduce (Firefox only)

On the 'Scalars' tab for tensorboard, view the graph of a scalar summary (eg cost or accuracy) by expanding the tab. 
Click on the expand icon 
Enable log scale of y-axis 
Disable log scale of y-axis (note the bug happens regardless of whether you do this) 
Click on expand icon to shrink the graph.

The graph is now overflowing:
