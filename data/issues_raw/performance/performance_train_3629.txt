Problems in "Implement the gradient in Python" docs

Referring to the docs here
First of all, the chain rule is completely wrong. Also the ZeroOut example is not a very good one IMO... would be much better to give e.g. a simple derivative of a polynomial or something. Just a FYI.
EDIT: I'd like to emphasize that the chain rule is embarrasingly wrong...
