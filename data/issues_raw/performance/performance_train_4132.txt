Unexpected performance changes as a function of batch size

I am observing unexpected performance from tensorflow as I change the batch size that I feed to the session.

I have created a small jupyter notebook to demonstrate the issue. Errors bars correspond to the standard deviation of the mean over multiple runs.
In some of our more complex models, the jump in runtime occurs at small batch sizes (around 200 images of 40 by 80 pixels).
