Graph Transforms | quantize_nodes | Android TensorFlow Inference | native error

I am using the Graph Transforms Tool (built with Bazel) to prepare my graph for Android TensorFlow Inference.
When using --transforms='quantize_weights' everything works just fine.
But with --transforms='quantize_weights quantize_nodes' I get this:
I/TensorFlowInferenceInterface: Checking to see if TensorFlow native methods are already loaded
I/TensorFlowInferenceInterface: TensorFlow native methods already loaded
A/libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 1, fault addr 0x0 in tid 22562 (obin.loremipsum)
        
        [ 03-24 19:19:10.194   375:  375 W/         ]
        debuggerd: handling request: pid=22562 uid=10173 gid=10173 tid=22562

I don't have any clue on what has happened.
I wasn't able to find anything related online.
