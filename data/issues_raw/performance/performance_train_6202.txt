Inconsistent API for ones_initializer/zeros_initializer

This cl has removed shape argument from ones_initializer, however, this argument remains for zeros_initializer.
This is a breaking change so maybe it should be mentioned in RELEASE.md with instructions on how code should transition (ie ones_initializer should be replaced with ones_initializer()). Currently older code that works in 0.11 fails in 0.12 with obscure message
ie
    update = tf.get_variable(name="update", shape=[params_size], dtype=dtype,
                             initializer=tf.ones_initializer)


fails with
...
    initial_value(), name="initial_value", dtype=dtype)
  File "/home/yaroslav/.conda/envs/openai/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/variable_scope.py", line 665, in <lambda>
    shape.as_list(), dtype=dtype, partition_info=partition_info)
TypeError: ones_initializer() got multiple values for argument 'dtype'
