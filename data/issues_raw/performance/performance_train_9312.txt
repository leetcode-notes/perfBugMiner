Typo in seq2seq.attention_wrapper.py

Hi,
I think there is a small typo in contrib.seq2seq.attention_wrapper.py, would someone like to check it?
code url: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_wrapper.py#L471]
I guess it should be probability_fn rather than cell_input_fn to be checked.
Thanks.
