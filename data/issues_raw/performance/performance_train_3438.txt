Discussion: A possible Profiling method for TensorFlow

Goals:

Get the timing run on CPU & GPU.
Get the timing for each OP (run on GPU or CPU) or a serial of OPs.

Identify the performance bottlenecks to do the optimization.
I just review some code for TF, and I find it should be possible to add some profiling code in tensorflow/core or tensorflow/stream_executor.
How about the idea? Any comments?
