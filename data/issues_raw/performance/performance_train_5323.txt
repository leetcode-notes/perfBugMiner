Memoization

I have a particle physics optimization problem where my graph contains a large subgraph that only needs to be calculated once every couple of iterations. The code I'm currently using for this uses memoization to create a significant increase in performance for these types of problems. I've been looking into porting the graph calculation part of my current code to TensorFlow, but it seems like the absence of memoization might become a show-stopper.
Are there plans to include support for memoization? If not, do you think this would be a good addition and do you have ideas on how to do this? I would be willing to contribute, if possible.
Ideally, one would be able to activate memoization per node/operation, so as to avoid performance hits due to overhead in nodes that need to be recalculated every time (i.e. that receive different arguments every time).
Perhaps this could be implemented using partial_run (#672), but I suspect a native c++ implementation would be vastly superior.
