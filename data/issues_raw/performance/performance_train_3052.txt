No nightly wheel with CUDA 8.0

Current nightly Linux wheel seems to be built with CUDA 7.5
Going from 7.5 to CUDA 8.0 gives me about 50% speed in TensorFlow up on 2048x2048 matmul on GTX 980 (2 T ops/sec -> 3 T ops/sec)

pip install --upgrade $url

# check that it has GPU support
# note, I see performance gain of 50% on matmul going from 7.5 to 8.0
