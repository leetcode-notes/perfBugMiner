TensorFlow 1.4.0 takes more resources and is slower on GPU and CPU

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): https://github.com/tkuanlun350/Tensorflow-SegNet
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7 x64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow-gpu/1.4.0rc1
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5
CUDA/cuDNN version:  Cuda release 8.0, V8.0.60. cuDNN 6.
GPU model and memory:  NVIDIA P4
Exact command to reproduce:   c:\python35\python3 main.py --log_dir=./logs --image_dir={image dir} --val_dir= {validation dir} --batch_size=15 --training=True

Describe the problem
Under 1.3.0 I was able to use a batch size of {15, put your max batch size here} for training.  Under 1.4.0 I get Resource Exhausted errors for that batch size.  So use of GPU resources is going up.  Not the right direction.
For me here are the performance effects:

TensorFlow GPU 1.3.0: 9.8 images/sec for batch size: 15
TensorFlow GPU 1.4.0:  Can't do batch size: 15. 7.8 images/sec for batch size: 12
