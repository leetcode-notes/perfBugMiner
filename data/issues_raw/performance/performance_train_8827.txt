bugs with cifar10 while doing evaluation

I slightly modify the cifar10 code, which is modifying length of width and height not to have same length.
height = 16
width = 32
While I did eval, it showed an error log cifar10_input.py at "  float_image.set_shape([height, width, 3])" this line.
I debugged it, I found a strange thing. Above two line from this, I found this "  resized_image = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(reshaped_image,width, height)".
The reason why I felt strange is the position of second and third param of resize_image_with_crop_or_pad is not same to compare any other functions. (normally height is second and width is third. or first and second.) I mean the order is strange.
So I think that "  resized_image = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(reshaped_image, height, width)" may be correct.
