The train and test data of wide and deep example is broken

Wide and deep example code will download train and test data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data and https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test. But those files are broken now and you can wget to read the raw data.

If I modify the file and run with this command, it works. Maybe we should fix the raw dataset or change to other valid files.
python ./wide_n_deep_tutorial.py --train_data /home/data/train_data --test_data /home/data/test_data
