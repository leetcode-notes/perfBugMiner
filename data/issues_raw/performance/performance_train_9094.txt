Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined when use TensorBoard projector

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)?: Yes. I was training a tree based network using Tensorflow Fold to train word embeddings for SQL parse tree. But this shouldn't be a problem because the TensorBoard can correctly read the checkpoint file.


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)?: binary (installed using pip)


TensorFlow version: 1.0.0


Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A


CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A


GPU Model and Memory: CPU only


Exact command to reproduce:

Open the log folder tflogs.zip using TensorBoard (Seems the absolute path is hardcoded in the checkpoint file, the absolute path should be /tmp/workspace/tflogs):
tensorboard --logdir=tflogs
Switch to embedding tab
Enable 3D label on the top left corner of the projector



Describe the problem clearly
Before enabling 3D label

After enabling 3D label

Expected result: label shown
Actual result: the projector becomes blank, while the following error shown in the js console:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined
