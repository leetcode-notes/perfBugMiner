If I import cv2, " tf.global_variables_initializer() " will be very slow.

Describe the problem
If I import cv2, " tf.global_variables_initializer() " will be very slow, about 143s. You can run my test code below, when " import cv2 " is commented out, the time is about 5s. The version of opencv is 2.4.13.4.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import cv2

weight = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([5,5,1,32], stddev=0.1))

ot = time.time()
init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
nt = time.time()
print('time: {:.3f}'.format(nt-ot))
