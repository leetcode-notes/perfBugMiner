TensorBoard --logdir=c:\foo support

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
no.  I am working with the full example to get the tensorboard to work.  I changed the file directory for the logs into something on my system:
train_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('D:/logs_dt' + '/train', sess.graph)
test_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('D:/logs_dt' + '/test')


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Window 10


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary with GPU


TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.1.0


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
n/a


CUDA/cuDNN version:
CUDA 8.0
cuDNN v5 for CUDA 8.0 (27 May 2016)


GPU model and memory:
NVIDIA GTX 1070 4GB


Exact command to reproduce:
from windows cmd:
tensorboard --logdir='D:\logs_dt'


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:

Describe the problem
I'm not seeing anything on the tensorboard at all.  I can see where the log director(ies) is/are created by the tutorial script, and the subdirectories /test and /train are there with the event data present.  I point the tensorboard to the populated log directory with the following command,  but it cannot see the event files.  Nothing is present in tensorboard, and I'm redirected back to the tutorials.
tensorboard --logdir='D:\logs_dt'
