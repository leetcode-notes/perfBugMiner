TensorBoard showing nothing!

I am trying to run the example in my Linux machine (Ubuntu 14.04):
tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py
First, I type "python mnist_with_summaries.py" in command line. Everything looks good.
Then following the tutorial, I type "tensorboard --logdir =/tmp/mnist_logs". Following message appeared.
WARNING:tensorflow:Unable to read TensorBoard tag
Starting TensorBoard  on port 6006
(You can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:6006)
Then I visit "http://0.0.0.0:6006" on Chrome,  nothing appears except:
" No scalar summary tags were found.
Maybe data hasn't loaded yet, or maybe you need to add some tf.scalar_summary ops to your graph, and serialize them using the tf.training.summary_io.SummaryWriter. "
In the terminal, following messages showed up:

I checked /tmp/mnist_log/, there is an event file named "events.out.tfevents.1457371474.rdii-Alienware-X51". Why nothing shows up on my TensorBoard ?  Please help me!
