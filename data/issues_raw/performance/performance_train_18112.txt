Why is tf.images.resize_bicubic different from misc.imresize with bicubic method

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Win 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0  cudnn 7.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080ti
Exact command to reproduce: N
I consider the implement of tf.images.resize_bicubic is similar to opencv resize method, but it has problem.
The opencv resize has more noise and less soomth. If we use opencv to resize image and process image super-resolution, it will degrade the performance.
There are some visual results generated by tensorflow and scipy.misc:

I wish the tensorflow can offer the implement of misc (or PIL, MATLAB)  resize method. Thanks!
