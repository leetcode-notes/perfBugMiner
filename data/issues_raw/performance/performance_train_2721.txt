tensorflow  performance of model evaluation using C++ is very lower than  using python. The model was trained by python ,and freezed to loaded by c++.

tensorflow evaluation using c++  has very lower performance, 100 times lower than using python.
1.The  model was trained using python,  freezed(using freeze_graph.py tool),  and then loaded by c++.
2.The evaluation speed :  1K+/s using python ,VS 10/s using C++.
