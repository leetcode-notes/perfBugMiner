tf.random_crop exception after upgrading to tf1.1 from tf1.0

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.4


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary


TensorFlow version (use command below):v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5 1.1.0


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1


GPU model and memory: Tesla m40 / 12 gb

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
