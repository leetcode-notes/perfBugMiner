Tensorboard Embedding with t-SNE Crash

When I run t-SNE on my datasets (on smallest or bigger one) with tensorboard embedding , the app crash all the times (after thereabout 500 iterations). I can't re-run or stop the operation to change the parameters, the iteration number freeze and the other functionalities on embedding part crash also.
Anyone have the same problem ? Other curiosity is if I run on online tensorboard embedding I have the same problem.
