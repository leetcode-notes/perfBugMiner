Tensorboard stopped showing runs names

Hi,
Tensorboard stopped showing runs names.
I can still filter (blindly) and see the curves, but there are no names of the runs to filter.
Any idea on how to fix that?
TF is installed under anaconda.
It worked with no issues until 2 weeks ago. I got back to the project today and this issue occurred.
I tried reinstalling 0.11, or even installing the latest 0.12.1 (under conda-forge), but the issue hasn't solved.
I also tried (with no luck)
cd /home/gamir/yuval/anaconda2/envs/tf_011/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/
python tensorboard.py --logdir=path/to/log

Attached is a screenshot, and below (the technical details) is the TB console output. Note that under TF12.1 there are no errors on the console output, but the issue still happens.

Thanks
