mnist.input_data.read_data_sets() cause Segmentation Fault upon exiting

While I was trying the MNIST tutorial, I found my tensorflow output Segmentation Fault (Core Dumped).
However, my mnist_softmax.py can still operates normally, outputing correct output on the terminal. It prints out the core dumped when the program exits.
After some try and error, I think it's this line
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(FLAGS.data_dir, one_hot=True)
causing program to Core dumped upon exiting. Maybe this is a r1.0 bug?

The same code as MNIST tutorial
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I've tried out the Getting Started tutorial, and it worked perfectly.
I've try to comment each line to figure out which line cause the error. The result is
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(FLAGS.data_dir, one_hot=True) seems to cause the problem.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
