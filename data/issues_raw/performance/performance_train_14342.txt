[Feature Request] Add payload only compression support for TFRecord files

This feature request is a follow up to PR #12369 and issue #12344.
Issue #12344 raised the feature request of supporting gzipped TFRecord files. However, the compression means the TFRecord file is gzipped as a whole and the header is compressed as well.
In certain situations, it might be desirable to expose the header and only compress the payload for better visibility and lookup performance.
This issue is a feature request to support payload only compression for TFRecord files.
