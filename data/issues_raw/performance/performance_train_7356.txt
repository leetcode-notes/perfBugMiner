Potential UnboundLocalError in error-handling context manager

I'm working on unrelated things while this came up, and it's possibly unlikely to happen in real development, but just to track it in case someone cares,

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/python/framework/errors_impl.py
    
    
         Line 471
      in
      5e5dc97
    
    
    
    

        
          
           pywrap_tensorflow.TF_DeleteStatus(status) 
        
    
  


that is an UnboundLocalError if it was line 463 that raised there (i.e. if TF_NewStatus failed entirely).
Without any insider knowledge, possibly that line belongs outside the try block.
