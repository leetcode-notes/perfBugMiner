Create/Init a curl handler each time it's expensive.

Hi,
Nice wrapper around libcurl but... initialize/clean_up a curl handler every time can be expensive especially if you need to perform multiple call on small data chunk. I'll suggest to update the "LibCurl" wrapper by adding a "static" cache where store the connection handlers once have been initialized (and reuse it). this will really impact the performances.
Best,
Diego
