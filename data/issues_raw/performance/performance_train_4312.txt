Can't configure due to undeclared packages inside if_android/if_ios

I am having trouble configuring the latest master branch (dbe7ee0). When I run ./configure, I get:
ERROR: [...]/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/BUILD:107:1: no such target '//tensorflow/core:android_lib_lite': target 'android_lib_lite' not declared in package 'tensorflow/core' defined by [...]/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD and referenced by '//tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle:session_bundle'.

Configuration finished

To summarize, the dependencies that are included inside the if_android and if_ios are not found. They don't exist in the repository, so that is not that surprising. What is more surprising though is that my vanilla installation is not returning empty lists when if_android is called. I haven't looked into how those functions work, so not sure why that is happening.
Environment info
Setup: CentOS, Bazel 0.3.1, CUDA 7.5, CuDNN 5.1, Tensorflow master (dbe7ee0)
I run configure and set it up for GPU support. Actually, I don't think this is criticial, but first I had to open up configure and add --output_base=... on the two calls to bazel, since my setup requires a custom cache directory.
Fix
The if_... lines were added in ed87884, so a fix that I know works is to use its parent commit 7705791.
