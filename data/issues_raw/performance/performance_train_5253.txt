Let user to choice whether to do bazel clean during configure

Currently running the configure will do 'bazel clean --expunge' by default.  It is OK for the first time to run configure.  But when I need to rerun the configure (because some errors occur, I will retry), I have to spend much time to download files from internet again each time during to the execution of 'bazel clean --expunge'.
So, should we let user to choice whether to do bazel clean during configure?
