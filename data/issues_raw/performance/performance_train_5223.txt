dynamic_RNN fails on mac with unspecified batch_Size

tl;dr:
dynamic_rnn fails on OS X with unspecified batch_size but works fine on Ubuntu 14.04/Python3.4.3.  It seems that on OS X the 'None != "?"' evaluates poorly, then at some point in ops/rnn.py +918 this equality fails:
if const_batch_size != got_batch_size:
(i.e. None != Dimension("?"))
My best guess is that Dimension("?") is hacked in such a way that any comparison using it returns some fake None which for some reason on OSX + python 3.4 means true (I tried explicitly "if None:" as a sanity check, it evaluates as false).  For now I've modified the offending code to be:
if const_batch_size != got_batch_size:
if  (const_batch_size != got_batch_size) == got_batch_size or (const_batch_size != got_batch_size) == const_batch_size:
print("weird dimensions stuff in ops/rnn.py, what the shit python?")
continue
raise ValueError(
"Batch_size is not the same for all the elements in the input.")

Environment info
Operating System:
OS X 10.12
Python 3.4.1
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
N/A (CPU version)
If installed from binary pip package, provide:
0.11.0rc1 (just installed wheel)
also fails on 0.10.0rc1, 0.10.0 (though it works on 0.10.0 on Linux)
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code).  It may work with less but this was a simpl
import tensorflow as tf
input_size = 256
length = 100
num_classes = 64
data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, length, input_size])
target = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, length, num_classes])
max_length = int(target.get_shape()[1])
num_classes = int(target.get_shape()[2])
network = tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(200)
output, new_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(network, data, dtype=tf.float32)
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Works fine on my Linux box with or without GPU
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
