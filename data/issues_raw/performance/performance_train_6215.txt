If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
My issue is on the online tool Embedding Projector (http://projector.tensorflow.org). On both Safari and Chrome, if I upload data via the "Load Data" button, I see a window "Computing PCA..." that never goes away.
A 10-sample version of my data can be found at 10samples.txt.
If I remove the string-based feature at the end—which happens to be the output/label for these samples—the problem goes away.
This case should be caught and an informative error message should be returned.
(Relatedly, I can't understand from the current interface how to add string-based labels for the data. The implication is that these labels are "metadata", but that's not clear.)
