Container localhost does not exist.

Hi,
I upgraded from 1.5.0-rc1 to the current master branch and I started receiving the following error:
2018-01-27 02:48:38.928667: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1201] OP_REQUIRES failed at lookup_table_op.cc:656 : Not found: Container localhost does not exist.

It's hard to reproduce this error but a summary of the context is that I have a lookup table op inside a dataset map operator and I get this error when I try to execute the corresponding iterator "GetNext" op. I'm looking for information in how to parse and debug this error. I never explicitly set any containers for my variables or lookup tables (i.e., leave them to the default value; an empty string). Were there any changes introduced recently that could result in this error? Note that this happens with my Scala API but not with the Python API and so it may be that I haven't updated something in my code. I just don't really know where to look for this.
Thanks!
