Word2Vec Number of Steps in Example

In the word2vec basic example (master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py) the number of steps is set to 100001. Is this an arbitrary number?
Should there not be a len(data) // (2*skip_window + 1  + (batch_size // num_skips)) number of steps to go through the data set?
