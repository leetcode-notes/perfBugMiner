The predict results using java and python is different

My graph contains the following statements:
tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm(incoming, is_training=is_training, scale=True, decay=0.99)
tf.contrib.layers.dropout(incoming, keep_prob=keep_prob, is_training=is_training)
When the variable is_training is set to True, the saved model give the same result using Java and Python. The result is right.
But, when the variable is_training is set to False, the saved model give different result using Java and Python. Python give a right result. Java give a wrong result.
Why does this happen?
Tensorflow:1.2.0
OS: centos7
Java:Sun jdk 1.8.0.144
Python:3.4.5
