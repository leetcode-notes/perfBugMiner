Crashes in tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Possibly related to #4282?
Also, SO seems to suggest that "abort trap 6" is related to accessing memory that TF doesn't own.
Both problems boil down to bounds errors crashing the Python session instead of throwing an error.
Environment info
Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
TF version 0.12.1. Pretty sure I'm using a CPU-only build, and my graphics card is not CUDA-compatible.
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I've managed to crash Python with sparse_tensor_dense_matmul in two different ways.  I've included a reproducible example for each.  Let me know if you'd prefer them split into two separate issues.
Crash 1
An off-by-one error crashes my Python session.
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

nrow = 3
ncol = 10

X = tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, ncol])
W = tf.ones([ncol,1])

# Note: largest allowable column index is ncol-1 because of zero-indexing
col_indices = [1, 2, ncol] 
indices = np.transpose(np.array([range(nrow),col_indices]))

sess.run(tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(X,W), feed_dict={X:(indices, [1] * nrow, [nrow, ncol])})

This kills my Python session, and I get the following at my bash prompt:
F tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_matmul_op.cc:242] Check failed: k < lhs_right (10 vs. 10)
Abort trap: 6

Crash 2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

n = 3
m = 3324
p = 49

a_sparse = tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, m])
b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([m, p]))


indices = [[0,0],[1, 2]]
values = [1, 1]
shape = [n,m]

feed={a_sparse:(np.array([[3828,  135],
        [ 320,   11]]), [1, 1], [2, 3324])}


init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(init)
sess.run(tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(a_sparse, b), feed_dict=feed)

F tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_matmul_op.cc:273] Check failed: m < out.dimension(0) (3828 vs. 2)
Abort trap: 6

It looks like I'm exceeding the number of rows this time, and getting a crash instead of an error.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
