`tf.reverse_sequence()` doesn't work with arguments of totally unknown shape.

From Stack Overflow:

I am trying to reverse my inputs with array_ops.reverse_sequence() before sending it to dynamic_rnn(), the inference graph can be build with no problem, but when building the training graph, I got the following error:
  Traceback (most recent call last):

The problem appears to arise when input_shape.ndims is None (which is a valid possibility).
