Example Digits Not working

I use the very last docker container, GPU Enabled (nvidia-docker).
Everything works fine for what I could have tested so far.
Host : Ubuntu 14.04 Server with CUDA and NVIDIA drivers up to date

device='GPU'; T in [DT_FLOAT]
device='GPU'; T in [DT_HALF]
device='CPU'; T in [DT_FLOAT]
device='CPU'; T in [DT_HALF]
I have uploaded a screenshot of the error:
