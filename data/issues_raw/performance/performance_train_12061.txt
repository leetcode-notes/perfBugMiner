OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):v1.2.0-2809-g7add4e6 1.2.1-rc2
Python version: Python 3.5.2

Exact command to reproduce: see below

Describe the problem
I test the efficiency of StagingArea(as described in https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models) on GPU compared to direct feed_dict to session.run input method.
The script shows these two methods have almost same speed, all about 34 seconds. But if I put all inputs to StagingArea first, the script just need 23 seconds to run. StagingArea method can't hide data copy time.
