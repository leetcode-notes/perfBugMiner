Strange Multi-GPU Performance

I am encountering a strange Multi-GPU performance issue. To validate I've run the following script TensorFlow Examples: Multi-GPU basics.
The performance on a single GPU was 19 seconds while dual GPU computation took 28 seconds.
The same effect was reproducible on my system when I used multi-GPU for computing my own networks. You can see a short description and an ASCII illustration of my architecture here: stackoverflow link.
The problem seems to get worse with bigger computations, since my own network is quite big and on a single GPU it is about 10 times faster than on two GPUs :/
