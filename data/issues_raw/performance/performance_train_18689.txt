[Request] Pre-build support old CPU

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NA
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian GNU/Linux 9.4 (stretch)
CPU model: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7- 8837  @ 2.67GHz and any "old" CPU
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow

Describe the problem
Since version 1.6 prebuilt binaries use AVX instructions, thus TF cannot be used on "old" CPUs. However, many of them are not that old. In fact, I was surprise that my server cannot run TF. I believe many people run into the same problem because those CPUs are popular in many labs at universities.
This is bad because it blocks many potential users/researchers from trying TF and starting using TF. User should not build TF themselves, because building by each user is daunting and resource-wasteful.
So if it is not technically impossible, please provide alternative prebuilt binaries that support old CPUs.
