TOCO converter requires min/max information for taking output from intermediate nodes?

Describe the problem
I have a quantized mobilenet downloaded from the official repository(here) , I want to collect output from the last pointwise convolutional layer of the network and run on a mobile.
The quantized frozen model contains additional fc,softmax etc layers that are of no use for my application.
To convert my quantized and frozen graph to specified input & output i run the below command
toco \
  --input_file=mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_frozen.pb \
  --output_file=corrected_mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_frozen.tflite \
  --input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF --output_format=TFLITE \
  --inference_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8 \
  --input_shape="1,224,224,3" \
  --input_array=input \
  --output_array=MobilenetV1/MobilenetV1/Conv2d_13_pointwise/Conv2D_Fold \
  --std_value=127.5 --mean_value=127.5

and receive the following output from the converter

Why does this quantized graph requires min max information for intermediate nodes when it can resolve the final nodes correctly without additional min/max information?
I also tried manually giving default min/max information but i suffer a huge performance drop if i do this.
