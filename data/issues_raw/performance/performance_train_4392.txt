LMDB Reading Feature

I would like to see a native feature where LMDB files are read by tensorflow inside the graph. I know it can be done with placeholders but that's suboptimal.
In general, there are three ways of approaching this in TF.
(1) Native Implementation / Custom Data Reader
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/new_data_formats/index.html
(2) Python Function Wrapping
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/api_docs/python/script_ops.html
(3) Placeholders
The functionality is neat but I require better performance..
If I were to do this myself, what are from a performance standpoint be the main differences between (1) and (2). In any case, it would be great if (1) ended up in the master branch.
