Running optimized graph with two output nodes on android gives “Session was not created with a graph before Run()” error.

Hi, please would you please be so kind and help me with one issue that prevents me from moving forward. I have graph with two output layers (final_result_orig – which is basically coming form retraining example,final_result_added – my custom layer) and I am unable to strip/optimize_on_inference it in order to run on android device (on pc it runs fine)
When I run:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference 
–input=/tmp/output.pb 
–output=/tmp/optimized.pb 
–input_names=Mul 
–output_names=”final_result_orig,final_result_added”
Then in my android application, I get “Session was not created with a graph before Run()” error, and both final_result_orig and final_result_added are not found.
When I run:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference 
–input=/tmp/output.pb 
–output=/tmp/optimized.pb 
–input_names=Mul 
–output_names=”final_result_orig”
It works fine, final_result_orig is available and works correctly, however final_result_added is obviously not found and not available for my app to use.
And when I run:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference 
–input=/tmp/output.pb 
–output=/tmp/optimized.pb 
–input_names=Mul 
–output_names=”final_result_added”
It does not work as well with “Session was not created with a graph before Run()” error, and both final_result_orig and final_result_added are not found.
I do not understand what I am doing wrong – what could be wrong with “final_result_added”, as it works fine on PC and not android? Thank you very much.
