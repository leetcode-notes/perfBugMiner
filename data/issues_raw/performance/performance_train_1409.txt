Image ops do not all accept NumPy arrays as arguments

From Stack Overflow:

When I run the line :
flipped_images = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(images)
I get the following error :
AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'get_shape'
My Tensor "images" is an ndarray (shape=[batch, im_size, im_size, channels]) of "batch" ndarrays (shape=[im_size, im_size, channels]).

On looking at the code, this happens because our shape checks expect arguments to already have been converted to a tf.Tensor. We should call ops.convert_to_tensor() on them before performing the check.
