protobuf message overflow on trying distributed

I'm trying to build an RNN on multi-machines following the Distributed Tensorflow.
when I use "with sv.managed_session(server.target) as sess:", it shows error:
AttributeError: 'Supervisor' object has no attribute 'managed_session'
So I follow the code of "Inception":
with sv.prepare_or_wait_for_session(server.target, config = sess_config) as sess :
Then it starts to run, but hangs immediately after reporting the following error:
[libprotobuf WARNING google/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:569] Reading dangerously large protocol message.  If the message turns out to be larger than 67108864 bytes, parsing will be halted for security reasons.  To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h.
[libprotobuf ERROR google/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:207] A protocol message was rejected because it was too big (more than 67108864 bytes).  To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h.
[libprotobuf WARNING google/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:81] The total number of bytes read was 67108864
E tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.cc:105] Input size was 67108839 and expected 72000800
Would you please help me on this?
Thanks a lot in advance!
