Eager: CPU Performance/Operation Overheads

(This applies only when eager execution has been enabled via tfe.enable_eager_execution())
Eager execution re-uses most of the same Python code used for constructing TensorFlow graphs. Many of these paths have not been optimized for part of the critical path of computation. As a result, the CPU overheads of executing Python code for every operation are higher than weâ€™d like.
Consequently, the performance of eager execution on models with many small computations, or models executed on CPU may be dominated by these overheads.
Overheads are measured using microbenchmarks such as in benchmarks_test.py and model-level benchmarks such as those used for ResNet50 and the PTB RNN
