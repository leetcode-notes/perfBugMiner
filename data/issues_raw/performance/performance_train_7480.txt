preprocessor definition clash with glog

CHECK macros from platform/logging.h leak out into core/public headers which clash with users of glog.
One path is through core/platform/allocator.h:
In file included from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/logging.h:25:0,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/allocator.h:26,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h:21,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/public/session.h:23,
(snip)
external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h:224:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
 #define CHECK_OP_LOG(name, op, val1, val2)                            \
 ^

This one is easy to fix by moving method implementation to allocator.cc.
Another is through core/lib/core/status.h.
In file included from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/logging.h:25:0,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/lib/core/status.h:24,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/lib/core/errors.h:19,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.h:24,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h:24,
                 from external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/core/public/session.h:23,

This one is more work to fix because TF_CHECK_OK is used all over the code, but it does not seem to be necessary for core/public.
