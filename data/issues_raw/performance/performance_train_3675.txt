Source-compiled 0.9.0 version performs worse than binary-installed one

I'm running my ResNet-32 benchmark model. My code looks quite similar with the code in TensorFlow GitHub:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10
but the model is changed into my own ResNet-32 implementation.
I'm measuring how long it takes to train a minibatch with size 128, and here are brief results. I used one GPU, 64bit Ubuntu 14.04 and Python 2.7 for all experiments.

0.9.0 (pip installed)
7.5 / 4.0.7
GTX Titan X
75


0.9.0 (745f16f)
8.0 RC / 5.0.5
GTX 1080
330


0.8.0 (ea9e00a)
8.0 RC / 5.0.5
GTX 1080
60

The 0.8.0 version commit contains the first support for CUDA 8.0 RC as far as I know and I found this to use my GTX 1080 without performance drop. Now I can use it with reasonable performance, but I want to figure out why the 0.9.0 compiled version is 4 times slower than before.
