GPU kernel for segment_sum?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-5-g435cdfc', '1.2.1')
Python version: 2.7.12
CUDA/cuDNN version: 6.0
GPU model and memory: GTK1070/ 8105MB

^^ I don't think system information is hugely relevant in this case, but writing them down anyways.
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
This is a feature request. I was running tf.unsorted_segment_sum on an unsorted list of segments, and thought that I might be able to get a performance gain if the segment ids are sorted (as that is usually the case).
However, to my surprise, I discovered that there are no supported GPU kernels for vanilla segment_sum, forcing tensorflow to copy memory over to the CPU and thereby slowing down the operation greatly.
Would it be possible to support an optimized GPU version of segment_sum that takes advantage of the fact that the segments are sorted?
