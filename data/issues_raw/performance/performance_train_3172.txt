float division by zero

It seems that if you only run 1 training step at a time then you can come to a point where it is too fast

ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero

This happens because the time between the start of the step and the end is exactly the same because it is a single step.
Here is the code snippet
current_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = current_time - self._last_time
    self._last_time = current_time
    # Reports the number of steps done per second
    steps_per_sec = added_steps / elapsed_time
    summary = Summary(value=[Summary.Value(tag=self._summary_tag,
                                           simple_value=steps_per_sec)])

Maybe add an if statement to just say zero if elapsed_time is zero?
