the program is not running on GPU

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution: windows 10
**TensorFlow installed from **: pip2 install tensorflow-gpu
TensorFlow version: ('v1.4.0')
Python version: Python 3.6.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
problem
while i run my program and check the performance on task manager it is not using GPU 1 Which is NVIDIA 940MX, it runs on INTEL GRAPHICS
i checked it by writing this line of code on my editor
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
the out put message is the following
