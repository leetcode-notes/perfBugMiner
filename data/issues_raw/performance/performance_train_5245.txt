mean_squared_error gives warning about sum_of_squared_error

I used tf.contrib.losses.mean_squared_error, but during training stage, tensorflow give me warning WARNING:tensorflow:sum_of_squares (from tensorflow.contrib.losses.python.losses.loss_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-10-01.
But I already used mean_squared_error, so this warning should not show.
Also the mean_squared_error definition link has the same warning, which I guess should not be there?
