Error encountered when serializing moving_average_variables

I compiled Tensorflow from source. Running cifar10_train.py outputs the following warning message:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing moving_average_variables.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
unbound method to_proto() must be called with Variable instance as first argument (got Tensor instance instead)
