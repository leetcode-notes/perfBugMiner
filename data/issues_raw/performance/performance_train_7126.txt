No module named tensorflow

System: macos sierra
Python 3.5.2 via anaconda, a special env tensorflow created and used (source activate tensorflow)
Here is how I installed the package:
  export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-py3-none-any.whl
  pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL

pip says all packages have been successfully installed, but if I try to import tensorflow, python says there is no such module.
It seems the module is named tensorflow_gpu:
(tensorflow) kaiyin@kaiyins-mbp 13:19:02 | ~ =>
pip show tensorflow
(tensorflow) kaiyin@kaiyins-mbp 13:19:09 | ~ =>
pip show tensorflow_gpu

Although tensorflow_gpu couldn't be imported, either.
Any idea what's going on here?
