multiple dequeue ops are optimized away in latest TF

Multiple ops Dequeue ops from the same queue started getting optimized away in latest TensorFlow:
The following executes dequeue once in Jan17 head, but 3 times in 12.1
sess.run([q.dequeue(), q.dequeue(), q.dequeue()])
One gets expected behavior (3 dequeues) when graph optimization is turned off
tf.ConfigProto(graph_options=tf.GraphOptions(optimizer_options=tf.OptimizerOptions(opt_level=tf.OptimizerOptions.L0)))
sess = tf.Session(config = config)
