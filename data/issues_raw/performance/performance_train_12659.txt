tf.maximum does not return nan when inputs contain nan

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux CentOS 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla K40m, 11439MiB
Exact command to reproduce: python main.py

Describe the problem
tf.maximum(a, b) should return nan when a or b contain nan. However, it does not at some cases.
Source code / logs
main.py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

a = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32)
max_a = tf.maximum(a, 1.)
with tf.Session():
    print max_a.eval(feed_dict={a: np.nan})
The output is:
1.0
