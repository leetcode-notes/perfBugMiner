bazel can not quantize image net inception models

when i run command : bazel build tensorflow/tools/quantization:quantize_graph --verbose_failures from this tutorial : https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/quantization, i get this error, and still can not fix it :
ERROR: /tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:1315:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow    /core/kernels:svd_op' failed: gcc failed: error executing command
virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory
I run this command on docker with single CPU. I have 1.5 GB RAM in docker.
So will i need more RAM to run it ?
can i download a quantize image net inception models without using bazel , like as downloading inception models without compiling it by bazel ?
