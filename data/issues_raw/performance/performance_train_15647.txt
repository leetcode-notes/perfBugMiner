Describe the problem
tensorflow.org master version should be updated to master, however it seems that it hasn't been regenerated for a while.
For example the latest addition of the performance guide for tf.data (ba32ea1) hasn't yet made it to the website:
Doc source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/performance/performance_guide.md
Generated web page in tensorflow.org (master version):
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/performance/performance_guide
