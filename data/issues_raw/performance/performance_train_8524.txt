Asking for TF's official implementation of the inception v3 model's distributed training

From the recorded video of TF dev summit held about one month ago, I got to know the newest distributed TF 1.0 is able to achieve 57x speed up for the inception v3 model on a server of 8 nodes/ 8 gpus and the codes will be released. Since I am far away from getting such a good scaling performance using my own distributed implementation, I have been looking forward to seeing and studying from the training codes from TF. Could anyone tell me the progress now? Thanks!
