Tensorflow Website XSRF Token missing or incorrect

The error occurs when I read current TF API documentation. My default lang is set to Russian (but it does not matter and has influence only on the bottom menu). But when I'm trying to change the language to English or Chinese I get the following error message:

XSRF Token missing or incorrect

Is it ok or this is the TF Website bug?
