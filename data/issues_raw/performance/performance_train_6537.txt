file_io.get_matching_files fails if any unrelated (non-matching) sub-directory is non-readable

Let filename = "/tmp/mymodel.005".
file_io.get_matching_files(filename) will raise an exception like
PermissionDeniedError: /tmp/.xrdp/xrdp-sesman-jjz1ox

for me. I think this is a bug as this is an unrelated (non-matching) directory, so it does not matter and it will anyway not match the filename, thus it should not raise an exception.
I get this via saver.restore(sess=..., save_path=filename) where saver = tf.train.Saver(...).
