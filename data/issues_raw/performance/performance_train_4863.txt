iOS error: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Mul' with these attrs [T=DT_INT32]

I have some issues performing a multiplication of int32 data on iOS. Session::Run fails with the error shown below, indicating that this particular multiplication op is not supported. I've already checked tf_op_files.txt, and 'tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_mul.cc' is there, obviously, and it looks to like the int32 version should also get registered there.
Do I need to take any extra steps to enable int32 multiplication on iOS?
This is the exact error message I'm getting:
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Mul' with these attrs
     [[Node: mul = Mul[T=DT_INT32](Cast, Cast)]]

I'm using TensorFlow 0.10. Here is how I create the graph def file in Python:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util

input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1,4), name='input')

v = tf.cast(input, tf.int32)
v = v * v
output = tf.cast(v, tf.float32, name='output')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(sess, sess.graph_def, ['output'])

with tf.gfile.GFile('/tmp/test_graph.pb', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())

Thanks a lot,
Peter
