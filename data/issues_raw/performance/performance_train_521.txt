resize_image_with_crop_or_pad doesn't work with input pipelines

Because tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad() requires its input to have a fully defined shape, it's not useful as part of an input pipeline since the size of images loaded will not be known in advance.
  queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(filenames)
  reader = tf.WholeFileReader()
  _, contents = reader.read(queue)
  image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(contents, channels=3)
  cropped = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(image, 224, 224)
Ideally the above would work...
