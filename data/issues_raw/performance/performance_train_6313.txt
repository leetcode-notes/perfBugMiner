Tensorboard has wrong logdir on Windows

I use Tensorflow 0.12rc1 on Windows. "Tensorboard" has problems parsing the logdir. My log-directory is at E:\tmp\tflogs. When I start tensorboard from the windows shell (cmd.exe) with:
tensorboard --logdir=E:\tmp\tflogs
it depends on the current directory / drive if it works or not (i.e., if tensorboard finds the runs and shows the data). If the current directory is, e.g., on the C:\ drive, tensorboard tries to add runs from c:\tmp\tflogs instead of E:\tmp\tflogs.
Example:
C:\Users\wrammer>tensorboard --logdir=E:\tmp\tflearn_logs --debug
The log contains lines such as:
INFO:tensorflow:Starting AddRunsFromDirectory: C:\tmp\tflearn_logs
