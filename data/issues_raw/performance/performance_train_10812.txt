`tf.Summary` comparison operator overloading?

So I was trying to use a comparison operation (>) with a tf.Summary object. It does not throw an error, but the results are incorrect. I couldn't find any help for this on the official documentation.
Here are my logs -->
(Pdb) type(losses[0])
<class 'tensorflow.core.framework.summary_pb2.Summary'>
(Pdb) type(losses[1])
<class 'tensorflow.core.framework.summary_pb2.Summary'>
(Pdb) losses
[value {
  tag: "CTC Loss"
  simple_value: 40.2547607422
}
, value {
  tag: "CTC Loss"
  simple_value: 42.1486358643
}
]
(Pdb) losses[0] > losses[1]
True

The objects were created using tf.Summary(value=[tf.Summary.Value(tag=tag, simple_value=value)]). What do you think? @dandelionmane ?
