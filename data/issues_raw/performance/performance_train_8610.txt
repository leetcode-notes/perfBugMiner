Tensorboard Embedding Sprite Image Aspect Ratio

I tried to use tensorboard embedding visualization with sprite images.
It works well except two things:

Even though I set the image width and height as:
embedding.sprite.single_image_dim.extend([my_width, my_height])
and the projector_config.pbtxt file has:
sprite {
image_path: "sprite.png"
single_image_dim: my_width
single_image_dim: my_height
}
Tensorboard resizes the images to be square, though it can get correct part from the sprite image, except that:
Every last image of each row is not correct. This happens when I have lots of images (like 200 images with size 70*100).

Seems like it only support square images?
