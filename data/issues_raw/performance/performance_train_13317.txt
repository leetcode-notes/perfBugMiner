TF v1.3 slower than v1.2 when used with ResNets

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
It's a custom code with fully convolutional ResNet using tf.slim implementation (with diluted kernels)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Debian 8.9
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.3
Python version:
Python 3.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:
CUDA 8.0/cuDNN 6.0
GPU model and memory:
NVIDIA K40m 12Gb

I run fully convolutional ResNet-101 on the images which vary in size. When moving from TF 1.2 to TF 1.3 inference became about 3x slower. With TF1.2 I use CUDA 8.0 and cudnn 5.1. To make sure variable sized images are processed fast I set env variable TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 to switch off auto-tuning of convolutions.
In case it is not to do with convolutions, but the data loading, here's how I feed the input data (numpy arrays) into the convnet:
outputs_np = sess.run(outputs, feed_dict={inputs: batch})
Could you suggest how I can troubleshoot that?
