TensorBoard command unable to handle the path properly in Windows

If you try to save the graph in a specific path eg C:\documents
writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('C:/documents/my_graph', sess.graph)
and try to show the graph with TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir="C:/documents/my_graph"
TensorBoard will not find any graph because is unable to load the path and looks always for the graph files in the default user pathC:\Users\andrew\mygraph\ if I run console as user or C:\Windows\System32 if I run console as administrator. This is a bug and should be fixed.
Tensorflow version 0.12.0rc1 pip installation
OS: Windows 10 x64
