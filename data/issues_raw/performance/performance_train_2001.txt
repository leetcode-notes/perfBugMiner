feature request: improve the training speed of GPU

tensorflow seems to have a good performance on CPU compared to other frameworks, however relatively poor on GPU according to third-party benchmark


Could I ask the reason why this happen? I belive Tensorflow is the hottest Deep Learning Framework on github. If we could make the performance of Tensorflow better, it will help a lot of people.
Anyone can help or contribute to this issue?
