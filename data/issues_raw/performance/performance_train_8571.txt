shape of state in the output of dynamic_rnn is undetermined

short code:
sequence_lengths, (sequences, labels) = bucket_by_sequence_length(
                                              input_length=sequence_length,
                                              tensors=[sequence, label],
                                              batch_size=72,
                                              bucket_boundaries=[80, 160, 240, 320, 400],
                                              dynamic_pad=True)
lstm_cell = core_rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=56)
lookup = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(......)
_, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
                      cell=lstm_cell,
                      inputs=lookup,
                      sequence_length=sequence_lengths,
                      dtype=tf.float32)

then state.h and state.c should be of shape [72, 56], but actually the first dim(batch_size) is undetermined in program, is it a bug?
