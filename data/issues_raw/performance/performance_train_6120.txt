Error needed when loading a GraphDef created in a newer version of TensorFlow

There are a lot of issues (e.g. #5628) that are caused by users loading GraphDefs that were created by a newer version of TensorFlow (e.g. 0.12 that introduces SaverV2) into older code bases. This currently results in cryptic errors late in the loading process, but instead we should raise an error (or at least a prominent warning) when a newer GraphDef version than is supported is loaded.
