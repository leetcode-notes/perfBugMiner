Poor performance of Android camera demo on arm64

I've been running the Android camera demo on both a Nexus 5 (armeabi-v7a) and Nexus 5X (arm64-v8a).  The older Nexus 5 is able to perform a single recognition in about ~350ms.  The Nexus 5X however performs at around ~750ms.  I wouldn't expect a newer device to perform worse (especially not that much worse) than the older one.
I've tried running the resulting apk from
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
as well as
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo --fat_apk_cpu=arm64-v8a
There's no change in performance for either option on the Nexus 5X.
I know that the -mfpu=neon flag seems to be a problem when building for arm64-v8a so I've had to remove it for those builds.  I suspect the performance issue might be related to the performance benefits of neon.  Is there a different flag that needs to be specified to enable neon support for the arm64-v8a architecture?  Or am I completely off base on the performance expectations on Nexus 5X?
