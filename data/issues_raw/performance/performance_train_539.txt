def set_shapes_for_outputs(op):
"""Uses the registered shape functions to set the shapes for op's outputs."""
try:
shape_func = _shape_registry.lookup(op.type)
except LookupError:
try:
shape_func = _default_shape_function_registry.lookup(op.type)
except LookupError:
raise RuntimeError("No shape function registered for standard op: %s"
% op.type)
shapes = shape_func(op)
if len(op.outputs) != len(shapes):
raise RuntimeError(
"Shape function for op %s returned %g shapes but expecting %g" %
(op, len(op.outputs), len(shapes)))
for output, s in zip(op.outputs, shapes):
output.set_shape(s)
The call of "Shape function for op %s returned %g shapes but expecting %g" %" is reversed, should be (op, len(op.shapes), len(outputs)); (i swapped the shapes and outputs) ... took me awhile to debug an unrelated bug because i was getting the wrong debug message ;)
