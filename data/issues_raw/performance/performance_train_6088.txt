Strided slice op CHECK failure

Two reports of a CHECK failure in the strided slice op have surfaced on Stack Overflow:

Tensorflow print value of a tensor
Tensorflow evaluate: Aborted (core dumped)

In both cases, the error message is:
F tensorflow/core/kernels/strided_slice_op.cc:316] Check failed: tmp.CopyFrom(input.Slice(begin[0], end[0]), final_shape) 
Aborted (core dumped)

...which appears to match the CHECK here.
It looks like both questions might be using the same model code, so I'll ask the questioner to post additional details if possible.
