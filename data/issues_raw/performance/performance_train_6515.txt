Enviroment: Ubuntu14.04
tensorflow installed with
sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
tensorboard fails to load events, even with the tensorflow_root_path/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_train.py.
run python cifar10_train.py, the event file
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/cifar_train gives
