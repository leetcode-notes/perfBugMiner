TF code crashes python kernel

The following piece of code:
import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(-1, 10))
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.array_ops.shape(a))

crashes the Python kernel. I realize it's not right (for one thing I'm not feeding it a feed_dict), but it should give an error and not crash the kernel.
