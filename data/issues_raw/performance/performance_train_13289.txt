Exact command to reproduce:
Any toy problem using https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/linear_optimizer/SdcaModel that mixes sparse and dense features.

Describe the problem
It's a bug.
When using both sparse and dense features in SDCAModel the _linear_predictions method output a tensor of wrong shape. This happens because the sparse results and dense results ranks are inconsistent in the current version and summing them trigger an unexpected broadcast.
#13279 fixes the bug.
