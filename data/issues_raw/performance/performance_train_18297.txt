Using Keras in Python with tensorflow-gpu backend. Worked fine for weeks until a few days ago, when I have suffered a huge performance drop.
When Tensorflow is initialising, it all appears to work correctly and finds my GPU as normal. Output:

But whereas before with exactly the same model on the same data, each epoch took about 2-3 seconds, they now take ~17 seconds.
I had a look in Task Manager, and my IDE shows to be using GPU Engine - "GPU 0 - Copy". Also at the beginning of each epoch, the GPU will go under ~70% load for about a second, but then the load switches over to my CPU and Memory for the remaining 15 seconds or so and the GPU goes back down to its idle load around 2%.
