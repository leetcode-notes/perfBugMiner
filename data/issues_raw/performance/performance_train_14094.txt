Utility classes for writing Java source code from a C++ process

This PR sets up a few tools for writing Java source files from the op generator (or any future generator of Java code written in C++).
They are handling most of the tricky cases known to be encountered when we'll generate the ops, including generics, wildcards, optional inner classes, etc. Note that they focus on simplicity rather than performance or memory optimitizations since they will only be used at compile time.
As stated in a previous PR, java_writer and source_writer are being kept separate since the later might be a good candidate to be move to the core::io layer if required some day.
