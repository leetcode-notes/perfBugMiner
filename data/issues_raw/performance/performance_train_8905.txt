SVD float64 NaN bug

I've encountered a tf.float64 matrix (of size 60 x 200) such that tf.svd of it returns NaNs, while
np.linalg.svd works fine.
Converting the matrix into tf.float32 and then converting back to tf.float64 makes everything works with TF too (while being a tiny perturbation).
Here is an example Jupyter notebook: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/dl.dropbox.com/s/mf9e2eqg2isupce/Scary%20matrix.ipynb?dl=0
You can download pickled matrix here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8wex6voladtgw1/scary_matrix.cPickle?dl=0
I'm using Conda Python 2.7.13 (tried on Mac and Ubuntu) and a fresh version of tensorflow from pip (tried both cpu and gpu versions).
