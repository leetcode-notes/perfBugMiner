Add kappa coefficient as a new metric?

Currently tensorflow supports using accuracy as a metric for model's performance.
However, for unbalanced datasets, kappa coefficient (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cohen%27s_kappa#) is a commonly used metric. Would it be possible to add this one in the model.metrics?
