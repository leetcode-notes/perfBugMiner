A bug of tf.reduce_logsumexp with `-inf`

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Linux CentOS 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0
Python version: 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1.3
GPU model and memory: Tesla K40m, 11439MiB
Exact command to reproduce:  python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print tf.Session().run(tf.reduce_logsumexp(float('-inf')))"

Describe the problem
The doc of tf.reduce_logsumexp says it

Computes log(sum(exp(elements across dimensions of a tensor))).

However, it does not when the tensor is -inf.
Source code / logs
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print tf.Session().run(tf.reduce_logsumexp(float('-inf')))"

prints
nan


python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print tf.Session().run(tf.log(tf.reduce_sum(tf.exp(float('-inf')))))"

prints
-inf
