extract_image_patches gradient only works with float32

tf.extract_image_patches() works well with tf.float64, however its gradient requires that tf.float32s are passed. Otherwise tf.gradients() raises:
TypeError: Input 'b' of 'SparseTensorDenseMatMul' Op has type float64 that does not match type float32 of argument 'a_values'..
Here is an example of the offending code. If I take the gradient with respect to X without casting, I get the error above.
castX = tf.cast(X, tf.float32, name="castX")  # This is needed to get it working
patches = tf.extract_image_patches(tf.reshape(castX, [-1, self.img_size[0], self.img_size[1], 1], name="rX"),
                                   [1, self.patch_size[0], self.patch_size[1], 1],
                                   [1, 1, 1, 1],
                                   [1, 1, 1, 1], "VALID")
shp = tf.shape(patches)
return tf.cast(tf.reshape(patches, [shp[0], shp[1] * shp[2], shp[3]]), float_type)
