LMDB reader Error in Reading Data of multi-thread, queue based input pipeline

Hi,
I am now using LMDB reader to read and decode my custom data into tensorflow training pipeline, based on the example:
def read_my_file_format(filename_queue):
  reader = tf.SomeReader()
  key, record_string = reader.read(filename_queue)
  example, label = tf.some_decoder(record_string)
  processed_example = some_processing(example)
  return processed_example, label

def input_pipeline(filenames, batch_size, num_epochs=None):
  filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(
      filenames, num_epochs=num_epochs, shuffle=True)
  example, label = read_my_file_format(filename_queue)
  min_after_dequeue = 10000
  capacity = min_after_dequeue + 3 * batch_size
  example_batch, label_batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch(
      [example, label], batch_size=batch_size, capacity=capacity,
      min_after_dequeue=min_after_dequeue)
  return example_batch, label_batch

Here, I designed my own decoder and used LMDB reader here. But the problem is that, when the num_epochs is not 1, there will be ERROR:
Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)

Could you help check this?
Thanks
