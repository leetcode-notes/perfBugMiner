TFLearn Estimator Summary Writer Fails.

Issue:
TFLearn estimator summary writer fails because _write_dict_to_summary() in /tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py dose not allow int values, which naturally stops the np.int64 valued 'global_step' parameter from being written, thus causing the summary writer to fail.
How to reproduce:
Try and run wide_n_deep_tutorial.py, and you will get:
INFO:tensorflow:Saving dict for global step 202: accuracy = 0.818254, accuracy/baseline_label_mean = 0.236226, accuracy/threshold_0.500000_mean = 0.818254, auc = 0.742517, global_step = 202, labels/actual_label_mean = 0.236226, labels/prediction_mean = 0.182356, loss = 0.680463, precision/positive_threshold_0.500000_mean = 0.764145, recall/positive_threshold_0.500000_mean = 0.333593 WARNING:tensorflow:Skipping summary for global_step, must be a float or np.float32.
