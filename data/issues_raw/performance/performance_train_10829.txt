Java API does not include quantize operations

When trying to run a quantized model with the Tensorflow Java API in version 1.2-rc0, I get the following exception in Java:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'QuantizeV2' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
  <no registered kernels>

	 [[Node: encoder/encoder_layer_0/Conv2D_eightbit_quantize_normalize/sub = QuantizeV2[T=DT_QUINT8, mode="MIN_FIRST"](normalize/sub, encoder/encoder_layer_0/Conv2D_eightbit_min_normalize/sub, encoder/encoder_layer_0/Conv2D_eightbit_max_normalize/sub)]]

It seams the kernels for quantized graphs are not included in the Java API binary of tensorflow. Can you add these kernels?
Note: The frozen model I used to create the quantized model runs perfect with the same code.
Note2: I quantized the graph with the current r1.2 branch of tensorflow.
