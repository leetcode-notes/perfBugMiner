Upgrade HighwayHash

The HighwayHash module which is downloaded as an external dependency in TensorFlow produces different hash results on big endian and little endian architectures. This causes the test testStringToHashBucketsStrong from //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:string_to_hash_bucket_op_test to fail on big endian. After raising an issue with HighwayHash community, they have added a change to make hash values consistent across architectures through commit.
Will it be possible to pick this or higher commit of HighwayHash in TensorFlow?
