Describe the problem
I ran a RNN model with tensorflow.contrib.cudnn_rnn.CudnnLSTM. After some epochs, the process hangs and never respond, even with ctrl + c. I also observed the volatile gpu-util fixes at 100% after the hang. This was not a problem when I ran the RNN with tensorflow.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell
