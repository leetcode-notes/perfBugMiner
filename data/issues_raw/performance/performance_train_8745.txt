TFRecordWriter doesn't throw an error when disk partition gets out of space

Problem
When tensorflow.python_io.TFRecordWriter(path) is initialized with a path leading to a device out of free storage space, one can still write() and close() it without receiving an error or exception. The resulting file is empty (0B).
Environment info
TF v.1.0.1 installed from pip3 (package tensorflow-gpu) with Python 3.4.2 on a Linux server.
Minimal example
writer = tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)
for i in files_in_shard:
  # ....
  # [prepare record]
  writer.write(example.SerializeToString())
writer.close()
