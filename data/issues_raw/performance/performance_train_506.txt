ptb_word_lm.py error: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'int'

Hi,
I ran the ptb_word_lm example from models/rnn/ptb. however I got the unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'int' for line 139 in ptb_word_lm.py.
I also managed to fix it, by changing
139 self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
to
139 self._cost = cost = tf.div(tf.reduce_sum(loss), tf.constant(batch_size, dtype=tf.types.float32))
And it works fine so far.
