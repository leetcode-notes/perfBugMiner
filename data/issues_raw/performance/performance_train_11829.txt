Slow to import tensorflow.contrib with Python 3 because inspect.stack is slow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Sierra 10.12.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.2.0-2420-g2b4a0f9a4 1.3.0-rc0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.2-homebrew
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU only build
GPU model and memory: CPU only build
Exact command to reproduce: time python3 -c "import tensorflow.contrib"

The problem
Doing import tensorflow.contrib take 7.5 seconds on my machine when doing it with Python 3.6.2. With Python 2.7.13 it takes 3.2 seconds.
Investigating this revealed that a lot of time is spent in _inspect.stack() in the function make_decorator in  python/util/tf_decorator.py. The stack is inspected to find the name of the caller of the function. With Python2 inspect.stack() is fast, but with Python 3 each call to inspect.stack() take approximately 0.2 seconds and there are 23 calls made, which account for the difference in time between Python 2 and 3.
References
Keras by default imports tensorflow.contrib when the Tensorflow backend is used. Therefore Keras is slow to import when using Python 3: fchollet/keras#7408
