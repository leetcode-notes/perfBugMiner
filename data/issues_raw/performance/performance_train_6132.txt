contrib.learn.Estimator does not work with multiple GPU

Attempting to assign ops to a GPU within model_fn passed to an Estimator produces the following error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'save/ShardedFilename_2': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:1' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
Colocation Debug Info:
Colocation group had the following types and devices: 
Identity: CPU 
ShardedFilename: CPU 
	 [[Node: save/ShardedFilename_2 = ShardedFilename[_device="/device:GPU:1"](save/Const, save/ShardedFilename_2/shard, save/num_shards)]]

This can be reproduced by running the example in examples/learn/multiple_gpu.py
