How can I modify RNN cell weight during each training epoch?

I want to binarize the weights of RNN-GRU cell during each training epoch, in order to reduce the model size and increase the performance. Instead of binarizing the weights after freezing the graph, I wonder how can I get access to and modify the weights during each training epoch, or more specifically, before computing gradients and updating weights? It seems no API is provided to let RNN cell weight exposed to users.
Thank you so much.
