iOS memory warnings

I tried posting this to SO first and it's been there a week with no activity: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39255211/tensorflow-ios-memory-warnings
We are building an iOS app to perform image classification using the TensorFlow library.
Using our machine learning model (91MB, 400 classes) and the TensorFlow 'simple' example, we get memory warnings on any iOS device with 1GB of RAM. 2GB models do not experience any warnings, while < 1GB models completely run out of memory and crash the app.
We are using the latest TensorFlow code from the master branch that includes this iOS memory performance commit, which we thought might help but didn't.
We have also tried setting various GPU options on our TF session object, including set_allow_growth(true) and set_per_process_gpu_memory_fraction().
Our only changes to the TF 'simple' example code is a wanted_width and wanted_height of 299, and an input_mean and input_std of 128.
Any thoughts? Is our model simply too big?
