[minor bug] tf1.0+ compatibility script doesn't handle old batch_matmul arguments

tf 1.0 merges batch_matmul into matmul, but the compatibility script forgot to rename the arguments for batch_matmul
what is needed is:
adj_x --> transpose_a
adj_y --> transpose_b
I would be happy to write a quick PR.
