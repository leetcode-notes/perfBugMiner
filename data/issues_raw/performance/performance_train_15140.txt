CUDA 9.1 planning ticket

Update 05-FEB-2018
The plan of record is to stick with CUDA 9.x until CUDA 10.  That plan has an issue in that CUDA 9 and 9.1 cause problems with XLA that should be resolved with CUDA 9.2.  The soft plan is we would move to 9.2 when it comes out if it resolves the issues with XLA.
Update 23-JAN-2018
CUDA 9.1 requires an upgrade to device driver 387 (CUDA 9 was 384).  Moving device drivers is painful for production environments.  We are not going to move the default builds to CUDA 9.1 or 9.2 we will stick with CUDA 9 likely until CUDA 10.  We will move cuDNN forward which will have a larger impact and not require device drive upgrades.  This space is developing as everyone involved evolves their processes and learns from the past.
While I cannot promise anything, I do want to create a "channel" where we are building and testing the latest CUDA 9.x so we can track performance improvements and have some avenue for people to get those builds.  The testing infrastructure is large and maintaining this has a cost.  I hope to find a middle ground as I like perf testing the latest libraries.
Original Message
The purpose of this thread is to keep CUDA 9.1 questions related to when it will be in TensorFlow in a single area.  Separate issues are fine.  I will try to keep this first comment updated with information as it comes out.
Current Status:  Unknown, waiting for RC and gathering information to formulate a plan.
p.s. There is a tendency to treat TensorFlow like a one way product.  I want to continue to change that with this type of dialog and transparency.  Many people outside Google will contribute to CUDA 9.1 support for TensorFlow.
