Decrease accuracy after upgrade from v0.11 to v0.12

Hi! I've recently updated from v0.11 to v.012 using pip with CUDA 8.0, cuDNN 5.1in a TitanX under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
During the training of a small CNN triplet network with triplet margin loss I noticed that the performance in terms of accuracy went down by a factor of ~40%.  Getting around 9% and 14% FPR95 with v0.11 and v0.12 respectively, both at epoch 30th. Notice with v0.12 the accuracy gets stuck in early epoch 10th.
The optimizer that I'm using is Momentum with a LR of 1e-4 without decay policy.
I've also added the regularization term with a weight decay of 1e-4.
Did you introduce any change with last versions in the optimization API that could make this difference?
PD: I left here the link to the code.

Notice that we are trying to reproduce from the original LuaTorch version.
