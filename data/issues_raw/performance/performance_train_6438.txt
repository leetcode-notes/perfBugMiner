Cannot show stderr when using Jupyter

Hello,
Could you please have a look about this.
I am using TF and Jupyter. But what makes me confuse is that the log text cannot be shown in Jupyter output cell (but it output correctly in ipython).
I think it is because of the stderr. This issue have been discussed before in #3047. You add several lines to determine whether or not current context is in an interactive environment.
However, even if I use Jupyter, the return value of "sys.flags.interactive" is still zero. and the logger lever can never be setted to "info" and use "stdout" instead of "stderr".
Thanks a lot!
