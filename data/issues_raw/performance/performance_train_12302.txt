memory leak bug

Hi, I have seen many issues reporting Tensorflow memory leak, so I wanted to report another sample of leak.
I was testing the GA3C code and after a while (about a day) the process taking all of 32g of memory.
system spec is
OS : Ubuntu 17.04
tensorflow version : 1.2.1 binary instalation
cuda version : 7.5
gpu : GeForce GTX 1080 SLI, 8gig of gpu memory
you can get the code from :

with many thanks
