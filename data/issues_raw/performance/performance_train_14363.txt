Failed to synchronize the stop event

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source


TensorFlow version (use command below):
b'v1.4.0-0-gd752244' 1.4.0


Python version:
3.5.2


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.7.0


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5) 5.4.0 20160609


CUDA/cuDNN version:
9.0/7.0


GPU model and memory:
Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB


Exact command to reproduce:


git clone https://github.com/ljanyst/image-segmentation-fcn.git
cd image-segmentation-fcn                                       
wget http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip
unzip data_road.zip                                     
./train.py  --data-dir data_road

Describe the problem
It seems like I am hitting some sort of a CUDA/cuDNN synchronization/race issue. Please see the snippet in the next section for the exact error message. The problem only happens with the KITTI dataset. The exact same TensorFlow code works fine for the Cityscapes dataset. Also, the problem only happens on Tesla V100. I tested the same exact software configuration on Tesla K80 and GeForce GTX1080 Ti as well, and things work fine.
