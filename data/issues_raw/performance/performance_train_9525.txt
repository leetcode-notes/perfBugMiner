Statically-linked libraries in TF binary can cause symbol collisions

TensorFlow currently statically links all dependencies. This sometimes causes hard-to-diagnose crashes (e.g. segfaults) when another version of a dependency is loaded into the process. This can even happen within TensorFlow if separate TensorFlow .so's are loaded into the same Python process.
Possible solutions would be to reduce the visibility of these symbols, dynamically link common libraries, or run TF in a separate process.
Known problematic libraries:

protobuf (#8403, #8394)
OpenCL, OpenCV (#7378)
