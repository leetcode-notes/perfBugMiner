Inception needs retraining (Was: Op is deprecated in Image Recognition tutorial)

When I'm running the Inception examples from the Image Recognition tutorial (https://tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition/), I'm getting a lot of warnings in the following form:
W tensorflow/core/kernels/batch_norm_op.cc:36] Op is deprecated. It will cease to work in GraphDef version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().
I recently upgraded Tensorflow to version 0.8.0, and I'm working on Mac OS X 10.10.2. While this isn't harming the performance, I'm wondering if there's a fix or an update that I'm missing.
