Filesystem FileExists interface is broken

The FileSystem define the following interface, which can't handle temporary runtime errors properly but just swallow them (like GCS, HDFS and any customized DFS),
virtual bool FileExists(const string& fname) = 0;
It should be changed to
virtual Status FileExists(const string& fname) = 0;
I can provide a patch if no one is working on this.
