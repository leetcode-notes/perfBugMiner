Fix broken link of performance guide for the `tf.data` API

As you can see in the Performance Guide, the below here didn't link to the correct place with https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#datasets_performance due to datasets_performance.md is another file instead of an anchor inside current file.

The tf.data API utilizes C++ multi-threading and has a much lower overhead than the Python-based queue_runner that is limited by Python's multi-threading performance. A detailed performance guide for the tf.data API can be found here.

This PR is to fix the above broken link of performance guide for the tf.data API.
