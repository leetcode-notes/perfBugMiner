[Suggestion]SVD GPU Op is not efficient than CPU.

when I used TF 1.2 version, there is no problem with using SVD
but few days ago i updated my tensorflow version to 1.5 and my code get extremely slow.
so I tested all possibility and  checked issues
finally i found that someone commited SVD GPU op made by cudasolver. in june, 2017
he said that it contain memcopy and it cause bottleneck. it is true and it make svd GPU op extremely slow than former version.
so please remove that op. and if possible, please make proper SVD GPU op  and gradients, and solve problem that tf.svd return nan value.
i uploaded my naive solution to avoid nan value problem and code for compute svd's gradients.
