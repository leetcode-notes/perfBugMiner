Warn when calling session.run() on a very large scatter

Scatter ops output a ref to the whole tensor for easier chaining. The problem is if one executes the op directly in Session.run() the whole tensor is copied back as a numpy array. This can create very annoying and hard to find performance problems. I think you should consider adding a warning.
For example:
large_table = tf.Variable(... [1000000, 3])
set3_op = tf.scatter_update(large_table, 3, [1,2,3])
session.run([set3_op])
Here run() modifies just 3 elements of the table but returns the whole table as a numpy array that is then
ignored.
