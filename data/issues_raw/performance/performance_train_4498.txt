TF Distributed not using the full network bandwith

Hi,
I have a one ps, 4 worker setup (2 workers are in the same machine as ps), I found no matter what batch size I choose, the network usage is always around 1.3 Gbit/s, which leads to very slow performance with small batch size. However, I do have 40 Gbit network, and when I run iperf -s/c between these two machines, I can usually get over 30 Gbit/s speed.
I am not sure if the issue is in TF implementation or my network setup. but since iperf proved, I doubt it's my infrastructure problem.
Below is the configuration
ps machine: Ubuntu 14.04, TF v0.10.0
worker machine: CentOS 7, TF v0.10.0
Python 2.7
GPU is Tesla M40
