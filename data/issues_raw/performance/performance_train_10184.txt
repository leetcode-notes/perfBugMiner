the performance is Unexpectedly in iOS

today i test Tensorflow(TF) iOS example with my iPhone 6S , according to the introduction in TF Website and source code , i know it use Apple's Accelerate framework , i build the protobuf , and TF's source code in my Mac , then run iOS example , i record the time with the code
tensorflow::Status run_status = tf_session->Run(
        {{input_layer_name, image_tensor}}, {output_layer_name}, {}, &outputs);

and the time is fast, only 90ms, i know TF's iOS example use the Google Inception V1 Model , and i test Apple's example which use Google Inception V3 Model , the time is 120ms, metal is more slow than Accelerate framework ? i can not understand . i do not think there is too much different feature that affect performance between inception V1 and V3... so how to explain it ?
