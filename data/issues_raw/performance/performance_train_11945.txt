Fix #11803: Force CUPTI to flush GPU activity buffers when stopping tracing.

As described #11803, stopping GPU tracing, GPU events are not flushed. Then we cannot get GPU activities in performance statistics.
Calling  ActivityFlushAll() with flag CUPTI_ACTIVITY_FLAG_NONE causes this problem, so this commit changes the flag to CUPTI_ACTIVITY_FLAG_FLUSH_FORCED.
