Setting up TensorFlow for development affects subsequent `bazel test` runs

After following instructions in Setting up TensorFlow for development , bazel test will look in _python_build before looking in .runfiles directory.
The result is that some tests may fail which would otherwise pass in a hermetic requirement. Also it could mean that some tests would pass which would otherwise fail in a hermetic environment. A work-around is to remove _python_build directory before running bazel test
Breaking into debugger while running test, I see following in sys.path, which confirms that _python_build is placed before .runfiles
