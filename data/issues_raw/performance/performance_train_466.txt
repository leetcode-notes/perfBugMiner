tf.unsorted_segment_sum exits without error message if segment_ids contains negative number.

When running
tf.unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None)
and passing a tensor containing -1 as segment_ids, tensorflow just exits without error message. I'm on the current master.
Desired behavior in my case would be to these values are 'rejected', i. e. are not summed anywhere at all. Would it make sense to extend this method this way? And if not, can you give me an idea how to implement this behavior?
