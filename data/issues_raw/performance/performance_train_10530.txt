Protobuf serialization slows down RDMA

According to a test similar to #6116, the current RDMA implementation has performance issues.
This tensor copy throughput according to this test (change assign_add to assign in L53, and test with tensor size 100MB):
Distributed rate: 536.72 MB per second

Which is just slightly higher than the gRPC implementation (the gRPC fixed version: #7466)
Here is the profiling result:
device1 worker profiling report
device2 worker profiling report
There are some obvious issue, for example, the string resize issue, the unnecessary memory copy and the single threaded serialization/deserialization.
