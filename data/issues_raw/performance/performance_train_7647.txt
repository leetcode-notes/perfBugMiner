If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Run this command:
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain --image_dir ~/flower_photos/ --print_misclassified_test_images
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Reviewed source code for retrain.py, both locally and latest version on Github. See lines 892-896 (inside main function). The code looks correct. I suspect it is an issue specific to Python 3.
I have not tried to run this in Python 2 yet.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
This is what is output:
=== MISCLASSIFIED TEST IMAGES ===
Traceback (most recent call last):

    print('%70s  %s' % (test_filename, image_lists.keys()[predictions[i]]))
TypeError: 'dict_keys' object does not support indexing

It appears the solution is to rewrite line 896 from:
print('%70s %s' % (test_filename, image_lists.keys()[predictions[i]]))
to:
print('%70s %s' % (test_filename, list(image_lists.keys())[predictions[i]]))
When I edit the code locally to the line above, I no longer get the error when I run the example.
