Unexpected behavior in tf.contrib.distributions.Categorical

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.12.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0
Python version: 2.7.10
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU
GPU model and memory: CPU
Exact command to reproduce:

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> t = tf.contrib.distributions.Categorical(probs=[0.0,0.0,0.0])
>>> print(sess.run(t.sample([1])))
>>> [3]  # outside the support of the distribution!

Describe the problem
I wonder if this is a bug or if this is a design choice to have tf.contrib.distributions.Categorical output a number outside the support of the distribution if all of the probabilities are 0. In any case, it would be helpful to throw an error when all probabilities are 0, rather than output a number that doesn't work.
