AssetFileDef is not updated when using Saved model builder.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Pulled from current master, but code is same at 1.4
Python version:
2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
-get latest tensorflow-serving
-add to mnist_saved_model.py

asset_path = tf.constant("/tmp/asset.txt", dtype=tf.string, name="PreProcessingSettings")
  tf.add_to_collection(tf.GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS, asset_path)
....
assets_collection = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS),
...
builder.save(as_text=True)

build mnist_saved_model.py
execute
observe that exported model meta_graph_defs do not have AssetFileDef populated
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
It seems that from the definition of meta graph def
that AssetFileDef should be populated, however instead the assets are just added to a collection... should it not be both?
It seems it should but it is not implemented. Would not be too hard to implement.
