Don't imply top_k is nondifferentiable

top_k is in the Evaluation section of the documentation, which says

The evaluation ops are useful for measuring the performance of a network. Since they are
nondifferentiable, they are typically used at evaluation time.

This is confusing, since top_k is differentiable.  Pointed out by @nmduc: #288 (comment).
