Describe the problem
I am trying to open TensorBoard after running mnist_with_summaries.py source code from the TensorBoard tutorials (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py). However,
After I run tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist in cmd, it stuck and did not showing anything else.  I try to use tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist --debug and have the same result.
