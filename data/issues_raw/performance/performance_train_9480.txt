Tensorboard 0.0.0.0:6006 cannot work On Win7 but localhost:6006 works

I use tensorboard on Win7.
Everyting works fine and the cmd shows "Starting TensorBoard b'47' at http://0.0.0.0:6006
"
But when I  input "http://0.0.0.0:6006" into chrome, nothing happens.
I google for it but find limited answer.
Then I input "http://localhost:6006" into chrome, the page comes out.
