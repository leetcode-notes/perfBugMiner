tf.matching_files order of returned files

As far as I can tell from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system.cc, the order of filenames returned by tf.matching_files can be non-determinstic.
If that is correct, it would be nice if that were stated in the documentation (and also for Dataset.list_files and train.match_filenames_once).
Even better would be to guarantee alphabetical order, but I am not sure about the performance overhead that would incur.
This would enable to process files given as e.g.
A/1.png, A/2.png, ... and B/1.png, ... jointly by doing to match_files followed by a zip.
