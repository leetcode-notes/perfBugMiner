make_test_graphs.py fails to open file in binary mode, breaks in py3

The file //tensorflow/compiler/aot/tests/make_test_graphs.py attempts to write binary data to files without opening the files in binary mode, which raises errors in Python 3. This can be fixed by opening the files in binary mode, i.e.
74     with open(saver_file, 'wb') as f:
75         f.write(saver.as_saver_def().SerializeToString())

I'm not sure if making this change will break Python 2. I will try and submit a pull request later in the week.
