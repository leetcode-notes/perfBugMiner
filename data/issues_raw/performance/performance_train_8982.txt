log_device_placement not working in some cases

Hey guys, thank you for working on TensorFlow so hard!
I think I found a small bug, but it might be so that I just don't understand ConfigProto correctly.
So:
config = tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)
server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server()
with tf.Session(server.target, config=config):

outputs the device placement correctly, but
config = tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)
server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server(config=config)
with tf.Session(server.target):

doesn't (at all).
While this is not groundbreaking, just wanted to let you know.
Cheers, Kris
