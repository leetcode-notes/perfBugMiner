tf.assign_from_checkpoint_fn needs write_version argument to pass to tf.Saver

Hi,
according to slim_walkthrough.ipython, when we load from checkpoints we can use assign_from_checkpoint_fn function.
But (maybe i thought) inside of slim.assign_from_checkpoint_fn, it create tf.Saver but there is no write_version args. And in my case, I have some ckpt with saver V2 but default saver version is 1 and slim.assign_from_checkpoint_fn doesn't have any code about this version issue so I can't load model using this function.
Any clue or plan to handle this issue?
Thanks.
