Minor optimization of conv_ops.

If data_format is NCHW, and the computation is done on the GPU, the temporary tensor transformed_output is not needed. One can use directly the output tensor. This
leaves more memory for the cudnn scratch allocator, possibly improving performance
of the convolution algorithm.
I also fixed several style issues in conv_ops.cc reported by clang-format.
I did not add any tests because the change is covered by python/kernel_tests/conv_ops_test.py.
