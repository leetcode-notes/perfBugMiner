tf.estimator generator_input_fn multi thread bug

I would like to use python generators as input pipeline for tf.estimator's. Finally I found generator_input_fn (announced here).
Nevertheless, when I start first experiments, I found I bug with learning curve. After some experiments I found the purpose of it - all blows up if you set num_threads > 1 in generator_input_fn.
For example, here is loss plot with python generator and num_threads=1:

And with num_threads=2:

But if I use tf.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn with 4 thread all work pretty well:

Except the fact, that I cannot save all my data in one numpy array (GBs of data).
Any suggestions why so? Or I need just wait for TF 1.2 with working tf.estimators.inputs.generator_input_fn?
