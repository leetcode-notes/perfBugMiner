If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

f = tf.gfile.GFile("data_batch_1")
pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1')

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried to manually read all data into a variable: s = f.read() and unpickle it: pickle.loads(s, encoding='latin'). It works well.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
I don't know why this happened. I checked the file_io code, and it returns byte object when calling read. So maybe this is something about pickle, any ideas?
