Singleton S3Client

Fixes #16230 .
This drastically speeds up performance of interactions with S3, and eliminates a lot of spurious log warnings when interacting with S3 files.
The filesystem unit tests went from taking ~40 seconds to taking ~4 seconds with this change, a 10X performance improvement.
Some items of note:

I updated the delete test to work on a bucket that had tests run previously. Without this change, a manual wipe of the file in quest was required after each run.
I moved the request timeout to a central location, instead of being local to the Sync operation.
I eliminated the increased connection timeout for Sync, which shouldn't be needed.
Configuration is no longer a static variable protected by a mutex, but instead created as-needed. This should be non-functional, given that config is only created once during normal operation now.
