graph_editor doesn't update graph_version

Symptom:

session.run
modify the graph with tf.contrib.graph_editor
session.run

Session.run in step 3 will use the same graph as in step 1 (pre-modification)
The reason is that session.py looks at self._graph.version when deciding whether to trigger TF_ExtendGraph. Since graph_editor doesn't update graph_version, it will reuse the previous graph.
Suggestion: every graph-modifying method in graph_editor should increment version attribute for the graph
