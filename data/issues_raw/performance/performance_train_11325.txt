[contribution] 3d geometric transformations?

Hi!
I wonder if you see purpose in adding 3d geometric transformations to contrib? (such as those available in transforms3d library)
I've written a few of those in tensorflow for one of my projects and I wonder if it would be worth doing some refactoring and documentation to make it contribution-worthy?
I've implemented them using tf python functions, I haven't done any lower level performance optimisation, is that fine?
