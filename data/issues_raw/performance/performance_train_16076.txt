If you use tf.test.TestCase.test_session() in setUp(), there will be one "skipped" test for which setUp() is run, but not tearDown(). I believe this has to do with tf.TestCase.test_session() trying to take care of automatic test discovery on the line above, but I'm not sure.
Source code / logs
In the following MWE (mwe.py), after running this test there will be a tmp.txt file left in the current directory.
MWE:
import tensorflow as tf

import os
import unittest

class FooTest(tf.test.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        with open("tmp.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("Hello")

        with self.test_session() as sess:
            pass

    def tearDown(self):
        os.unlink("tmp.txt")

    def testExample(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 1)

if __name__=="__main__":
    unittest.main()
