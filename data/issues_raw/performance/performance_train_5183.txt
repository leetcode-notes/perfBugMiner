Problems when using "bazel build"  to download ImageNet data

Hi all,
I tried to download the Imagenet data with the code provided in Inception model, but there was a problem when I used code:
bazel build inception/download_and_preprocess_imagenet
The tensorflow was installed in a Singularity container. And the environment is a high-performance cluster.
Running Code:
[yichengwang125@i21a-s2 ~]$ ml load tensorflow
[yichengwang125@i21a-s2 ~]$ cd ufrc/image/image/models-master/inception/
[yichengwang125@i21a-s2 inception]$ touch WORKSPACE
[yichengwang125@i21a-s2 inception]$ DATA_DIR=$HOME/image/
[yichengwang125@i21a-s2 inception]$ bazel build inception/download_and_preprocess_imagenet
