Tests in //tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/... sometimes time out

Some of the tests in this directory (in particular, master_test and rpc/grpc_session_test) spawn subprocesses containing TensorFlow servers that listen on unused ports. There is a potential TOCTOU bug in this code because the process is:

Pick unused ports in the parent.
Fork processes and instruct them to bind to the picked ports. (At this point another process can bind the same ports.)
Connect to subprocesses from the parent.

Running these tests in exclusive mode is a workaround for the problem.
