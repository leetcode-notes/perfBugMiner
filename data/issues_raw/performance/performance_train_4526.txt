GPU-resident queue for prefetching over PCIe

It would improve performance in some cases to be able to asynchronously prefetch data over the PCIe bus while GPU computation is taking place. A GPU-resident queue seems like the natural way to achieve this.
In the SO thread below, @yaroslavvb mentions using Variables pinned to the GPU to achieve the same effect, but I was unable to find a way to get this to work.
