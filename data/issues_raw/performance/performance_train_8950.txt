Execution Stuck after few steps in sess.run()

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Execution is stuck in between steps. For few steps, it seems to run fine but after that the execution just halts without throwing any exception or the error.

I ran the mnist_deep.py script provided in tutorials.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Previously, the display used to get hang showing error CUDA_LAUNCH_ERROR_TIMEOUT. On nvidia forum, someone suggested to switch off the X-server. I switched it off, but the problem still persisted.
I noticed that the script was hogging full memory of GPU, I tried to limit the allocation by using "allow_growth" flag. But the problem still persists.
