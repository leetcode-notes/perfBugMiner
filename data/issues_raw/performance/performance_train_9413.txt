Android ops - not supporting NCHW data format

Hi,
I'm using my custom tensorflow v1.0.1 model freezed and exported to Android arm-ABI-v7a (I compiled tensorflow 1.0.1 with selective registration for the models ops).
As a training time optimization we tried to convert the data format to NCHW format (as written in the tensorflow performance tutorial).
But now, when I run inference on Android, I get the following error in the logcat:
E/native: tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:233 Error during inference: Invalid argument: CPU BiasOp only supports NHWC. [[Node: conv_layer_1/BiasAdd = BiasAdd[T=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NCHW", _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](conv_layer_1/conv_l11, bc11_init)]]
Are you going to add NCHW support for android CPU ops in the future versions?
Thanks,
Eran
