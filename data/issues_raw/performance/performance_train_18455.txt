eager mode fails with custom operator

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):

Yes, I have written a custom tensorflow operator

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):

Linux Ubuntu 16.04

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

binary wheel

TensorFlow version (use command below):

('v1.7.0-3-g024aecf414', '1.7.0')

Python version:

python 2.7.12

Bazel version (if compiling from source):

N/A

GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):

N/A

CUDA/cuDNN version:

N/A

GPU model and memory:

N/A

Exact command to reproduce:

Custom operator is defined here but I doubt you'll want to look through that.
import tensorflow as tf
tf.enable_eager_execution()

from montblanc.impl.rime.tensorflow.tensorflow_ops import phase

lm = np.random.random((10,2)).astype(np.float32)
uvw = np.random.random((10,3,2)).astype(np.float32)
freq = np.linspace(.856e9, .856e8*2, 4).astype(np.float32)

# Convert into tfe Variable
lm, uvw, freq = (tfe.Variable(a) for a in (lm, uvw, freq))
value = phase(lm, uvw, freq, CT=tf.complex64)
This produces the following stack trace
Traceback (most recent call last):

Describe the problem
Eager mode does not work with a custom operator.
