numpy prod overflow during creating tensor

I am trying to allocate super large tensor using tensorflow, but failed.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py#L417
Above code uses numpy.prod to calculate shape size, and for numpy everything is typed, say if the shape is [500000000, 5], then numpy.prod returns -1794967296, it's very easy to reproduce it.
So how about use int64 instead? int64 should be large enough for any tensor.
Changing shape_size = np.prod(shape) to shape_size = np.prod(shape, dtype=np.int64) should fix it. Also about 100 lines of code using np.prod, could we change them all to int64?
