Batch support for deterministic image ops

Based on #14854 and working on #8926
Previously I had implemented batch support for a number of image ops. However performance concerns were raised and the changes were reverted.
I have re-implemented the changes for:

flip_left_right
flip_up_down
transpose_image
rot90

I ran performance tests from #15348 with:
bazel run -c opt //tensorflow/python:image_ops_test -- --benchmarks=FlipImageBenchmark

Let me know if you would like me to add more performance tests for the other methods. I don't think there should be any performance impact, but I'm happy to add more if you'd like.
