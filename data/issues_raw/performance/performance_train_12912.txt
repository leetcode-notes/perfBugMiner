T-SNE Suddenly Not Working in Projector

Hello,
I'm sorry this isn't a technical question, but just this week I've noticed that T-SNE in the tensorboard projector is no longer clustering data properly. I am running the same vectors I did a few weeks ago, with the same perplexity. While before I saw distinct clusters, now the points are all forming an indistinct ball. Has anyone else noticed this?
