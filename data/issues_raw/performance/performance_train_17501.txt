Describe the problem
I save my pre-trained model into .pb file according to freeze_graph.py and optimize_for_inference.py
Once I covert to .tflite by command-line with following cmd:

~/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/toco 
--input_file=RD_Net_TransConv_fuse.pb 
--output_file=./RD_Net_TransConv_fuse.tflite 
--input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF 
--output_format=TFLITE 
--inference_type=FLOAT 
--input_data_types =FLOAT 
--input_arrays=Placeholder 
--output_arrays=seq_4/Conv/BiasAdd 
--input_shapes=1,240,320,3 
--logtostderr

the error show that "TransposeConv" is not supported :

2018-03-07 15:07:49.317477: F tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/tflite/export.cc:304] Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: TransposeConv.

If I use python_api to convert my tensor into .tflite, it work fine without any error msg.
But the .tflite can not be used in android....  it will crash when  I want to getOutputName or run
error msg in android:

Can't get Output Names, model error:Invalid handle to Interpreter.

does tensorflow lite support "TransposeConv"? I don't see any information in Compatibility Guide
Any suggestion? Thanks~~~
