TensorFlow is 1.3-7 times slower than Theano for small models

I created a small benchmark (https://github.com/wjaskowski/tensorflow-vs-theano-benchmark) which shows that, depending on the model architecture, Tensorflow is 1.3-7 times slower than Theano depending on the model architecture. The question is whether this effect is due to a design decision or a performance bug, which may be solved in the future?
