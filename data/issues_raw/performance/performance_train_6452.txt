If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Just any neural network model. Strangely enough CIFAR functioned fine.
I used images of size 1750 * 1750.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I ran it on CPU and there was no issue at all other than the slow training speed.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
Unfortunately because the memory leak crashes my computer within seconds, I can only give a rough example. It roughly says" GPU has failed to allocate ~~ around 8 GB of ram. The GTX 960 on my machine only has 4 GB of ram. I'm not sure why 8 GB was suddenly gobbled up at once.
