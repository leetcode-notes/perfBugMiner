Incorrect protobuf SHA in workspace.bzl for v1.3.0

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0 (the tagged version, specifically 9e76bf32)
Python version: 3.5.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
Exact command to reproduce: ./configure (with all the default answers, and the specified python version above), then bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
When attempting to build the pip package in the repository on the latest tagged release (v1.3.0), I get the following fatal build error:
ERROR: /home/ubuntu/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD:100:1: no such package '@protobuf//': java.io.IOException: Error downloading [https://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz, http://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/google/protobuf/archive/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz] to /home/ubuntu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_whitlock/8ea56cff279f39ec6c0003641e649819/external/protobuf/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz: Checksum was e5fdeee6b28cf6c38d61243adff06628baa434a22b5ebb7432d2a7fbabbdb13d but wanted 6d43b9d223ce09e5d4ce8b0060cb8a7513577a35a64c7e3dad10f0703bf3ad93 and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:licenses'
It looks to me like the SHA changed for that version was not specified correctly. However, this seems strange to me because I had built against this version within the last couple of weeks without issue. master does not have this problem.
Replacing the SHA in tensorflow/workspace.bzl with the one in the error message (e5fdeee...) solves this issue.
