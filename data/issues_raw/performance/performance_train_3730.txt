tf.round != np.round

Looks like tensorflow and numpy use different tie-breaking rules:
tf.round(0.5) => 1
np.round(0.5) => 0

Both are sound, so actually there's no bug, however since tf and np are tightly coupled is worth considering to uniform them or at least to explictly mention it in the doc.
Especially because np is often used as ground truth for tf tests.

Steps to reproduce
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

with tf.Session() as S:
    tf_round = S.run(tf.round(0.5))

np_round = np.round(0.5)

print "round(0.5) => tf: {:.2f}\t np:{:.2}".format(tf_round, np_round)

assert np_round == tf_round
