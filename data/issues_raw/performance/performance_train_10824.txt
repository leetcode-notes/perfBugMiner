Constant operator is not appropriate for variable initialize

Tensorflow uses const tensor to initialize variables(for example ones_initializer, zeros_initializer and some optimizer slot creation), this will prevent AssignOpto transfer ownership from rhs to lhs and waster a lot of memory when variable shape is very large(for example sparse model). see #9823 #9742
