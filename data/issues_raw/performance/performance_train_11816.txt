Snappy related tests are failing

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 'v1.2.1-0-gb4957ff', '1.2.1'
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: No GPU
GPU model and memory: No GPU
Exact command to reproduce: bazel test //tensorflow/core:lib_io_snappy_snappy_buffers_test

The problem:
While executing test TEST(SnappyBuffers, MultipleWritesWithoutFlush). It fails when Snappy_Uncompress() method is called which internally calls snappy::RawUncompress().
Compared the same on intel x86 where it works fine; However the data somehow gets lost on s390x.
I am aware that Snappy behaves differently on s390x as compared to others.
There is another test //tensorflow/core:lib_io_table_test which fails when snappy compress/uncompress is used.
Would like to know if the mentioned test-cases are used to test some complex functionality of TensorFlow? Can they be ignored?
