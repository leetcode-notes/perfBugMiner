Enhance layout optimization logic to remove duplicated layout transpose operation for performance improvement purpose.
For example:
a NCHW-to-NHWC transpose op followed by a NHWC-to-NCHW
transpose op, under this scenario these two ops acutally can be absorbed into
nothing, thus avoid unnecessary computation.
