Saver errors in 0.7.0

In 0.7, there are different errors about Saver, first Warnings in serialization, such as moving averages, or dictionaries:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing moving_average_variables.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
unbound method to_proto() must be called with Variable instance as first argument (got Tensor instance instead)
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing summary_tags.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
'dict' object has no attribute 'name'

and then, it throws an OS Error:
  File "/Users/aymeric/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py", line 970, in save
    self.export_meta_graph(meta_graph_file_name)
  File "/Users/aymeric/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py", line 990, in export_meta_graph
    as_text=as_text)

    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''

But this is working well in 0.6.0, so Saver might have some issues in 0.7.0
