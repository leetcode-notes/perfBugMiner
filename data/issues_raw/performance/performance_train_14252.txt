[Feature request] tf.edit_distance return deletions, substitutions, insertions

Hi,
When analysing the performance of a speech recognition model, it is very useful to know the distribution of deletions, substitutions and insertions on the test set.
Could you make tf.edit_distance return these three metrics too, in addition to the cheapest cost?
It appears to me that the cpp code already computes them. What do you think, @ebrevdo ?
