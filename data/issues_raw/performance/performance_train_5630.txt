`_bag_features` doesn't work properly in Random Forest (TensorForest)

TensorFlow r0.10 , but code appears to be the same in master.
To Reproduce
Create Random Forest (tf.contrib.learn.TensorForestEstimator) with default parameters (ForestHParams) with the exception of setting feature_bagging_fraction to anything below 1.0 e.g. 0.8. I believe the issue lies in the _bag_features implementation in tensor_forest.py.
