Will there be custom GPU kernels for NHWC Batchnorm in the future?

NCHW Batchnorm #1759 is one merge away but as it currently stands the NHWC Batchnorm kernel is the single biggest performance killer in very deep networks. My testing shows that Resnet-164's forward pass taking more than twice as much time as that of Resnet-110, simply because the former has an additional BN of increased channel dimension (x4) in each block, despite the two architecture having nearly the same FLOPs.
Edit: Actually meant Resnet-164, not Resnet-152
