Tensorflow freezes for a small model in Windows 10

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
--> I have not been able to find any related information. I did post a SO thread (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41889147/tensorflow-execution-freezes-for-a-small-cnn), and got the suggestion that I may have encountered a bug.
Environment info
Operating System:
--> Windows 10 home edition
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
--> None. Was using the CPU version.
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
--> https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
--> 0.12.1

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

A brief explanation of the issue:
Training freezes as I slightly increase the model size. For the attached code, using 50, 50 for the two fully-connected layers would work, but going slightly larger, e.g., to 100, 50, would result in execution freezing after model initialization or a few rounds of training. It does not seem to be constrained by memory, since when the freeze occurs the Python process takes around 50MB of memory (as observed from task manager), while when the training runs (for smaller sizes) it takes GB range of memory.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
--> None, as I was unable to find related info by searching and I myself does not understand the possible cause of this issue.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
