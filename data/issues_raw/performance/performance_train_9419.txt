1080P image by SRGAN automatically killed

When I use a small image for SRGAN training, it runs well, but when I use a 1080P image for generation, the process killed without any related log. The batch is 8 so I don't think it will run out all my GPU memory, also there's no fully connection layer in my SRGAN
gpu device: GTX 1060 6G
tf version: 1.0.0
python version: 2.7
if my code is required, pleasure to provide it
