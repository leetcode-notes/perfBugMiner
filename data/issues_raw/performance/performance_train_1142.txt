0.7.0 pip packages are not named properly (error: is not a supported wheel on this platform).  [Will be fixed in next binary release]

My os is ubuntu 14.04
My python version is 2.7.6
Following the instructions for installing with pip I am getting this error:

$ sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl
tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Storing debug log for failure in /home/terence/.pip/pip.log

It works fine installing older releases of tensorflow with pip but not this one.
