Runs regex filter doesn't work in tensorboard v1.1

System information

Custom code, worked fine on 1.0
OS: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
installed binary via pip3
TensorFlow version v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5, 1.1.0
CUDA v8.0, cuDNN v5.1
GTX 1070, 8GB RAM
To reproduce: run tensorboard, try to filter runs in web interface, nothing happens

Problem description
Running tensorboard with v1.1 gives me the following warnings in the console (repeated four times) once the web interface is opened:
WARNING:tensorflow:path ../external/data/plugin/text/runs not found, sending 404
At first I ignored it, but it turns out that when examining the runs in the web interface, the regex filter for the runs doesn't work at all. This exact command in the exact same folder with the exact same logs worked without issue with v1.0.
