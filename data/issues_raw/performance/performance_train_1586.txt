TensorBoard prints warning: TAG not not found

On start, TensorBoard prints the following message:
WARNING:tensorflow:IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/danmane/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/TAG' on path /Users/danmane/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/TAG
WARNING:tensorflow:Unable to read TensorBoard tag

This issue is harmless but distracting.
