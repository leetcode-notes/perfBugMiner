BUG: TypeError in DNNClassifier.eval() when using same name for feature in feature_engineering_fn

Describe the problem
If we use the  same key to replace a feature, tensorflow might throw TypeError when evaluating:
eg:
def feature_engineering_fn(features, label):
  features["x"] = some_func(features["x"])
When features is dict, it is a mutable object. Hence the bug is caused by evaluate method which runs feature_engineering_fn again, see code.
I'll open a PR later.
