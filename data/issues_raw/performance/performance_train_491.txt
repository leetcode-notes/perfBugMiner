Mac OS X GPU Support Request

Hi Team
Currently I've been doing some work with TensorFlow (some of my work on http://blog.otoro.net/) and have been developing everything a Macbook Pro running the IPython stack.  My Mac is fairly fast for regular sized tasks, and even has an NVIDA chip (NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB).  Although the current build doesn't support GPU's for Macs, it seems to me from reading earlier threads that it is not possible to custom build for GPU support on the Mac, despite having CUDA libraries installed.
This would really help out my work flow, especially I can get other frameworks to utilize my GPU / CUDA on the Mac.  The Macbook Pro is a great machine to develop use and develop stuff on, and lots of people I know also use MBP's to develop ML algorithms, and then send jobs off to AWS for the heavy-lifting after it works locally.
I think having GPU support for Mac would really help in not just the performance front, but allows us to debug and check any GPU specific issues when running some script locally, and be able to fix them quickly, before sending them to a EC2 or some remote GPU server.  It would make the workflow a lot smoother for developers who use Macbook Pro's with the NVIDIA chip.
Thanks in advance!
