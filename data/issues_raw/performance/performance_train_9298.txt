[cmake/feature request] provide USE_SYSTEM_xxx flags to skip dependency builds

Tensorflow's cmake build will download and compile all of its dependency. Julia[1] does something similar to maximize its performance. However Julia provided some optional flags such as USE_SYSTEM_FFTW so users can compile Julia against the FFTW library provided by system package manager (e.g. apt/dpkg). I wish Tensorflow's cmake build could provide similar options to skip building its dependencies and just use the system provided one.
