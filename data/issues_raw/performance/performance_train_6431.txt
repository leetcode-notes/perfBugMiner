Does TF support multicore processing on Android?

As we know, iPhone play better performance than other Android mobiles on single CPU, presenting Android takes more time to run an inference. But Android usually have four or more CPU cores and iPone have only two. So I want to speed up Android's inference by using multicore processing.
What solutions have you tried?
I add -fopenmp build options according to Eigen multi-threading docs, but it doesn't work, the speed is still the same.
Could anyone point me in the right direction here?
Thanks!
