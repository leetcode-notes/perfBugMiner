Dockerfile manual build central repo URL is Incorrect

Dockerfile and Dockerfile.gpu have URLs that do not point to valid repo
Current URL in Dockerfile and Dockerfile.gpu
http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Changing the version number to 1.0.0 fixes the problem.
Working URL: http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
Not sure if the intent was to leave it at 0.0.0. If so, comments instructing the user to edit the URL to the current version would be helpful.
