slim doesn't play well with the new tf.layers v 1.0

We use tf.contrib.slim to build NN architecture. After upgrade to tensorflow 1.0 the are some trouble when building models with slim. For example slim.arg_scope doesn't work with the tf.layers components. And when we keep using slim.* layers, we got a runtime error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Session was not created with a graph before Run()!

If we use all the layers from tf.layers this runtime error goes away.
Any ideas ?
