Issue with while_loop in tf.scan

Hello,
I have recently updated to the newest version of tensorflow (v1.0) and am suddenly having some trouble when I use tf.scan.
I have already tried setting shapes for all of the variables. Which didn't work! Don't really know what else i could do since that is the solution that is recommended for the error in tf.while_loop...
Here is the code snippet:
h, z = tf.scan( self.sample, x, initializer = [ h0, tf.expand_dims(z0, 1 )] )
Where h0 is [256, 90], z0 is expanded to [256, 1] and x is [None, 256, 400]. It worked in the previous version so I am assuming the trouble is related to the tf.scan code.
ValueError: The shape for scan/while/Merge_2:0 is not an invariant for the loop. It enters the loop with shape (256, 1), but has shape (256,) after one iteration. Provide shape invariants using either the shape_invariants argument of tf.while_loop or set_shape() on the loop variables.
