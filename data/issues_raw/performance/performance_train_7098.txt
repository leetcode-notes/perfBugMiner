CPU performance issue, desynchronized cores

From time to time I have 600% CPU utilization and great performance while feeding batches into my model. But after few minutes, or even hours, CPU stuck on near 100% and everything becomes too slow.
While it's 600% utilization, CPU History shows great synchronization between all my cores. After it degraded, it seems like desynchronization.
I use CPU only for input pipeline, reading data from SSD.
Ubuntu 16.04, CPU intel, Nvidia GTX cards, and a lot of free RAM memory.
While 600% utilization:

While 100% :

/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches doesn't solve my problem
