strip_unused assumes all placeholders are the same type

strip_unused assumes that all of the placeholders are of the same type which may not be the case. This method is also used by optimize_for_inference which leads to errors when the models is loaded:
 msg std::__1::string "Input 0 of node dropout6/cond/Switch was passed float from Placeholder_2:0 incompatible with expected bool." 

I suggest having an option to introspect the graph to determine type.
