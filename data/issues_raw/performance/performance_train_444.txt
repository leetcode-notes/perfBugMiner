Python3 bug, filter has no len

I have build the latest source (a5d8217) and I tried running the mnist tutorial. This fails with:
File "/l/psmit/tensorflow/env_py3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/gradients.py", line 447, in gradients
if gate_gradients and len(filter(None, in_grads)) > 1:
TypeError: object of type 'filter' has no len()
A filter in py3 is not a list, so it has not length. This could be solved by changing
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/gradients.py#L447
to e.g. sum(1 for _ in filter())
