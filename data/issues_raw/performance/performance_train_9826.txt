C API Exception

Hi,
The C API method "TF_GraphGetTensorNumDims" throws an exception with message "Node X was not found in the graph" even for valid nodes that are in the graph. This tends to happen with the outputs of particular ops (e.g., reshape and matmul). I think it may have to do with shape inference after looking at the C API implementation but I'm not sure what's wrong. Is there something I need to do to enable shape inference when compiling the shared library? I thought that was enabled by default. Or is there something else that's broken?
Thank you,
Anthony
