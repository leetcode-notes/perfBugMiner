terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc', not out of memory

Hi, I'm using Keras with tensorflow back-end to train a LSTM network, I was doing a grid search over the learning_rate and dropout factor with the fixed batch size of 64, It ran perfectly but in the middle of it was interrupted by signal 6: SIGABRT with the following error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'  what():  std::bad_alloc

It should not be a memory allocation problem because it was running earlier for batch size of 64 which is not too much in my case
you can find my system information(tf_env.txt) from the following link:
