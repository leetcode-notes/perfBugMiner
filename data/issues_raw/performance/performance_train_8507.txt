Environment info
Operating System: osx
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: no
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed: nightly, python3, today
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)":1.0.1

import tensorflow as tf
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    x = tf.get_variable('W', shape=[10])

sess = tf.Session()
from tensorflow.python import debug as tf_debug
sess = tf_debug.LocalCLIDebugWrapperSession(sess)
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
My machine doesn't have GPU, and the above code throws:
OSError: Dump root directory /var/folders/3t/1kq225bs04j3k_2rbdcn2g34g86_w8/T/tfdbg_fw0uylcr does not exist

But it should throw the device error, like when debug session is not used:
Cannot assign a device to node 'W': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no devices matching that specification are registered in this process; available devices: /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0
