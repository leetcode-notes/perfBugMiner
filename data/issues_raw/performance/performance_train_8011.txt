TypeError: Fetch argument None has invalid type <class 'NoneType'>

Feature request for a better error description OR for better summary handling:
The following code works fine if some summaries where defined before:
ops=[] 
ops += [tf.summary.merge_all()]
session.run(ops)

However if there were no summaries we get:
TypeError: Fetch argument None has invalid type <class 'NoneType'>
Which is really saying:  "One of the session.run ops where empty, which is forbidden."
Alternatively let merge_all return a NoOp if there are no summaries.
