tensorflow create myOwn_op.dll on windows

Hi tf developers, I have one request regarding tensorflow's windows version.
I have tensorflow+gpu successfully built on windows 10 with visual studio 2015, from the source code.
as a result, I get tensorflow.dll and tensorflow.lib.
I have CUDA8.0 and cudnn 5.0; with a gtx 1080 gpu equipped.
however, my question is not about building and compiling tensorflow.
it is about creating tensorflow plugins.
I followed the tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op to construct my own "plug-in".
and then I tried to compile a windows .dll; so windows would not export symbols automatically for me .
then I compile a static lib first and used your tools
/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/tools/create_def_file.py
to create a .def file for me and eventually used that to compile the .dll.
however, in my python code, when I tried to correlation =  tf.load_op_library(correlation.dll) and I called      correlation.correlation()
with Correlation registered using REGISTER_OP("Correlation");
it still tells me
AttributeError: module '7b088d8b906b36d3e50721b0adbaaa6a' has no attribute 'correlation'
I think this is just  a windows (or cl compiler) issue, maybe what REGISTER_OP("Correlation") did is just not picked up by the compiler,
so is there any thing I can do to make this happen on windows??
