Tensorflow takes all my CPUs

I am having issue with CPU usage. I am running my code on a node with 4 GPUs and 12 CPUs.
I am using TFRecords for reading my data and it works well. However when I run my model Tensorflow uses all the CPUs available on my node (even when I specify that I want to use only one thread):

I wanted to check what are the devices founded by Tensorflow by running this:
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
print(device_lib.list_local_devices())
Log:
[name: "/cpu:0"
device_type: "CPU"
memory_limit: 268435456
locality {
}
incarnation: 5188106746934734819
, name: "/gpu:0"
device_type: "GPU"

}

physical_device_desc: "device: 0, name: GeForce GTX TITAN X, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0"
]
Given the output it seems Tensorflow finds and uses only one CPU. But maybe this CPU founded is a kind of "concatenation" of the 12 CPUs available on my node..
How to specify Tensorflow to use only one CPU?
How to make Tensorflow understand that I have several CPUs on my node? ( I can't find an config option or something else in the tf.Session()
Thanks for your help.
I installed Tensorflow using "pip install tensorflow" and below is the output of python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)":
0.12.0-rc1
An when I run this, it tells me that I have my 12 cores:
import multiprocessing
multiprocessing.cpu_count()
12
