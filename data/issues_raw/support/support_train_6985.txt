API changes: Missing RNN Module (continued)

(This is a continuation of issue #6984, which was closed before I could respond.)
Thank you.  But the question is still unanswered.
Given that tf.contrib.rnn no longer exists.  What is the replacement for it?  I've read the docs, but haven't found an answer.
In other words, what method is used to fuse together multiple RNN cells?
I've tried the following:
lstm_cell_1 = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(n_hidden)
outputs, states = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell(lstm_cell_1, Xnew)

But get the following error message:
TypeError: 'MultiRNNCell' object is not iterable

So, What method is used to fuse together multiple RNN cells?
