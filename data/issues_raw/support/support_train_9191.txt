TensorFlow crashing when batching audio

I have tried to create an audio processing model using tensorflow.contrib.ffmpeg. The code I wrote consistently crashes the python process on my OS X. I have provided both the code and a piece of crash report on this stackoverflow question.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
