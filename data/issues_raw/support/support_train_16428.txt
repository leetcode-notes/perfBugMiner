want keras to work on GPU, but actually on CPU

System information:
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04:
TensorFlow installed from anaconda:
Keras installed from pip
TensorFlow version 1.4.1
Bazel version : None:
CUDA/cuDNN version : CUDA V7.5.17, CuDNN v6.0:
GPU: GeForce GeForce GTX 1050 Ti(3.94GB):
Code: mnist_mlp.py
When run the code, it shows the following log:

Using TensorFlow backend.

Have no idea why it shows:

2018-01-25 17:31:16.679268: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:892] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero

And the code is actually running on the CPU, although the log shows the info of GPU
What have tried: stackoverflow :)
