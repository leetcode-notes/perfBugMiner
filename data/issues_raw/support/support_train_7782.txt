control_dependencies and assign new shape not working (using validate_shape=False)

Environment info
Operating System: OSX on CPU
Tensorflow 1.0.0
Problem
Hello, i've been trying to use tf.assign with a tf.control_dependencies scheme when changing the shape on the fly.
import tensorflow as tf

# I define a "shape-able" Variable
x = tf.Variable(
    [], 
    dtype=tf.int32,
    validate_shape=False,
    trainable=False
)
# I build a new shape and assign it to x
concat = tf.concat([x, [0]], 0)
assign_op = tf.assign(x, concat, validate_shape=False)

with tf.control_dependencies([assign_op]):
    # I print x after the assignment
    # Note that the Print call is on "x" and NOT "assign_op"
    print_op_dep = tf.Print(x, data=[x], message="print_op_dep:")
    # The assign_op is called, but it seems that print statement happens
    # before the assignment

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(3):
        sess.run(print_op_dep)
Outputs:
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[]
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[0]
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[0 0]
I would expect:
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[0]
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[0 0]
I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] print_op_dep:[0 0 0]

Is this a bug ?
