tf-r1.3: show Warning Info when saving checkpoint

I met some warn info show above when saving checkpoint: (all code here)
saver.save(sess, "models/model", global_step=train_batch_idx)
log like this:

WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing model_variables. Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef. 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'to_proto'

this log occur in r1.3, but do not occur in r1.2 .
tf do save a checkpoint. But I am not sure the checkpoint has been saved correctly when this log occur.
