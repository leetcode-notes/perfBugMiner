Unable to build tensorflow for Java in Windows

As many may have this problem, I am unable to build tensorflow for Java in Windows. I need to build tensorflow for Java with GPU support in Windows. I followed all the directions specified, and I get the following error message:
Thank you!

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10, msys2 64bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory: Quadro K5200
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config opt //tensorflow/java:tensorflow //tensorflow/java:libtensorflow_jni

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
