[iOS] No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Prod' with these attrs

I'm trying to load the faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco model from the Tensorflow Object Detection model zoo onto the iOS camera example.  Currently, I'm running in to the issue with
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Prod' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
  <no registered kernels>

The environment is as follows:

python 3.6
xcode 9.0.1
mac os 10.12
tensorflow built from source using r1.4
bazel 0.5.4

I have done things as follow:


Following the iOS static library build instructions,


Successfully ran


tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh
3. Successfully ran
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_ios_protobuf.sh

Successfully ran

export HOST_NSYNC_LIB=`tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_nsync.sh`
export TARGET_NSYNC_LIB=`tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_nsync.sh -t ios`


Created faster-rcnn specific ops:

  bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:print_selective_registration_header 
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/print_selective_registration_header \
    --graphs=frozen_inference_graph.pb > ops_to_register.h



Moved ops_to_register.h under tensorflow/core/framework/


Successfully built libtensorflow-core.a to account for additional types and custom ops


tensorflow/contrib/makefile/compile_ios_tensorflow.sh "-O3  -DANDROID_TYPES=ANDROID_TYPES_FULL -DSELECTIVE_REGISTRATION -DSUPPORT_SELECTIVE_REGISTRATION"


Verified the creation of

tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf_ios/lib/libprotobuf.a
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf_ios/lib/libprotobuf-lite.a



Check for tf_op_files.txt, and made sure tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc exists (I think this is where "Prod" is covered since there's no such file as cwise_op_prod.cc?)


Updated iOS camera example with faster-rcnn model, imported "mscoco_label_map", and corresponding input/output layers.


When running, I can't get pass error

If I try the same steps with the model ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco from the same model zoo, it works fine.  I've also tried the instructions from JieHe96/iOS_Tensorflow_ObjectDetection_Example but runs into the exact same problem.
Can anyone help?
