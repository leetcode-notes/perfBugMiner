No proper documentation to use transfer learning using pretrained model in .ckpt format

Hi all,
Tensorflow had provided a retrain sample  code for inception v3 pretrained model to apply transfer learning usinng .pb file of the model.
But there is  no documentation on how  to use a .ckpt file for pretrained  models on Imagenet such as  Resnet,inception_resnet, etc.
Not much information of  how  to get a .pb file  for these pretrained model in .ckpt format.
Has anyone tried transfer learning on these models?
If yes, did they use .ckpt  or .pb  version oof the model?
How to get a .pb and how to perform transfer learning usinng .ckpt version ?
Please help me on the same.
thank and regards
