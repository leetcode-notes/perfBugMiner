Tensorboard showing problems under keras callbacks

My code runs well without any errors showing. However, when I use the command
tensorboard --logdir = "my path", it shows nothing. I want someone to help me! Thanks.
tensorflow 1.0.1 keras 2.0  and python 3.4
And I found the debug shows:
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard is in debug mode.
INFO:tensorflow:Starting TensorBoard in directory /home/lk/lk
INFO:tensorflow:TensorBoard path_to_run is: {'/home/lk/lk/=': None}
INFO:tensorflow:Event Multiplexer initializing.
INFO:tensorflow:Event Multiplexer done initializing

(You can navigate to http://127.0.1.1:6006)


of which between INFO:tensorflow:Beginning EventMultiplexer.Reload() and INFO:tensorflow:Finished with EventMultiplexer.Reload(). There is no debuging information.
