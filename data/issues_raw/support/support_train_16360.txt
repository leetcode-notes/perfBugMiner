Python: Make an alias for "tf.variable" (with a lower "v") so the naming of it is consistent with "tf.placeholder"/"tf.constant"

Describe the problem
Many developers learn the naming standards of the software so they can write code faster. It does not make any sense to have to things "tf.placeholder" and "tf.Variable" named using different schema. Constant, Placeholder and Variable are similar entities and can be used interchangeably. They should be named in same style even if tf.Variable is a class.
