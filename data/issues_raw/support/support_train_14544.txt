ValueError: Variable RNNLM/RNNLM/embedding_layer/embedding/Adam_2/ does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE in VarScope?

when running following code,
with tf.variable_scope('RNNLM') as scope:
model = RNNLM_Model(config)
scope.reuse_variables()
gen_model = RNNLM_Model(gen_config)
this problem occurs:
ValueError: Variable RNNLM/RNNLM/embedding_layer/embedding/Adam_2/ does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE in VarScope?
why it is 'RNNLM/RNNLM/embedding_layer'?
the following code can run successfully
model = RNNLM_Model(config)
tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()
gen_model = RNNLM_Model(gen_config)
