AttributeError:  'Tensor' object has no attribute 'assign_add'

Describe the problem
I have constructed an object detector architecture based on ResNet-101. APIs in TF-Slim are mainly used in the structure. However when I finally create a train op by 'slim.learning.create_train_op' I receive such error. Tracebacks are showing below.
My environments: Ubuntu 16.04, CUDA 8.0, tensorflow 1.3.0
Source code / logs

I found another issue same as mine but I can assure there is no variable accidentally named as 'tf' in my code as that issue suggests. I just try to build the model and no images or labels are feeded since both of them are set as tf.placeholder. It seems that such error emerges during the process of building computation graph for update ops.
