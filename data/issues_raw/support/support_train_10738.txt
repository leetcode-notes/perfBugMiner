hexagon graph execution has put checks for inputs to be of square dimensions, why is it so?

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64bits
Android Version: 7.1 (Nougat)
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
HEXAGON SDK: 3.1
nnlib source: https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/hexagon_nn/nnlib
I want to test against input shape 1 640 480 3
Below check is returning with error as it is looking for square dimensions.
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/hexagon/hexagon_graph_execution_test.cc#L136)
CHECK(fsize >= (WIDTH + 1) * WIDTH * 3 + header_size);
I am not sure whether I can comment that and I did following that I got this error:
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/hexagon/hexagon_graph_execution_test.cc#L147)
CHECK(src_pos + 2 + header_size < fsize);
CHECK(dst_pos + 2 < pixel_count);

Also cannot give input graph as argument while running -> hexagon_graph_execution.
it needs to be changed @
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/hexagon/hexagon_graph_execution_test.cc#L52)

constexpr const char* const IMAGE_FILENAME = "/data/local/tmp/img_299x299.bmp";
constexpr const char* const MODEL_FILENAME =
"/data/local/tmp/tensorflow_inception_v3_stripped_optimized_quantized.pb";

any plans for standard interface to change

input shape
model filename
Image filename

thanks,
