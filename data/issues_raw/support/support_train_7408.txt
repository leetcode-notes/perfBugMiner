Cannot achieve the reported accuracy 0.844 with wide_n_deep_tutorial

After running the code in "wide_n_deep_tutorial.py", I achieved accuracy 0.834 for wide-only model, but the achieved accuracy for wide-and-deep model was only about 0.82.
I didn't change anything in the source code and just couldn't achieve the accuracy 0.844 as reported on the website. Can anyone help me to tell where could sth be wrong?
