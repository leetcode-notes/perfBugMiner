Don't know if tensorflow supports this type of restoring a model.

I am new here so I have a basic question. I want to train a cnn for 20000 steps. In the 100th step I want to save all variables and after that I want to re-run my code restoring model and starting from the 101- step. I am trying to make it work with tensorflow documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/variables/index.html
but I don't know if I am right. When I re-run my code I don't initialize again variables because I run saver.restore and according to my accuracy it works. I achieve big accuracy from the beginning so I think model is restored. Although, I would like to start the loop from the 101 - step. So:
1st question: Am I saving and restoring in the right way?
2nd question: How can I start from the 101-step when re-running?
