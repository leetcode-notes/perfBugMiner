Is something wrong about slim.learning.train?

source code
My code is so complex and very very long, so I just describe my code logic.
I add two parameters run_tensor and run_placeholder to slim.learning.train, the run_tensor is the tensor I want to run and the run_placeholder is placeholder I need to feed. And I also add two parameters run_tensor and run_placeholder to train_step, and train_step is passed to slim.learning.train's train_step_fn. So every training step, I can run run_tensor in the  train_step  function, and I'm sure I have fed the run_placeholder, but when I run the program, it raise an error, like:
Invalid argument: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'Placeholder' with dtype float and shape
[...]

I debug for long time, and find it may be the line
I have updated tensorflow to 1.4.0, but I  find my slim.learning.train only use sv.stop(threads, close_summary_writer=True), without ignore_live_threads=ignore_live_threads.
I find what's wrong, it is tf.summary.scalar, slim doesn't run summary op with feed_dict.
Maybe I think slim need to support feed_dict on every training step.
