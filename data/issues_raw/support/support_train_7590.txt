Tutorials on Estimators, Canned Estimators

Hi,
I checked out the tensorflow dev-summit yesterday and came to know about Estimators and Canned Estimators. Estimators and Canned Estimators are intended to bring simple model-data wrapping capability to tensorflow, I believe. However, I am not able to find a lot of tutorials/docs on the interface for an estimator or documentation on how to write Canned Estimators/Estimators. tf.contrib.learn has estimator modules only for simple ML methods like mlps, linear regressors. I would like to know if there are gists/github code for estimators/canned estimators for cnns/auto-encoders/LSTMS.
