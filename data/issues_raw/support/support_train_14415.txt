tensorflow-master install from sources doesn't install with pip3

System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from: source
TensorFlow version:  tensorflow-master
Python version:  3.5.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.9.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA 1080

Describe the problem
The bazel commands only appear to build Python 2.7 packages, not Python 3.5 packages.
To reproduce
Following [Installing TensorFlow from Sources: Ubuntu][https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources], I get  this bazel configuration from running configure.
I build and install with
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
sudo bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/

but the wheel generated is for Python 2.7:
ls /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
tensorflow-1.4.0rc1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl

and so I can't install it with pip3:
$ sudo -H  pip3 install  /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.4.0rc1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
[sudo] password for kevin: 
tensorflow-1.4.0rc1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

$ sudo -H  pip install  /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.4.0rc1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
Requirement already satisfied: tensorflow==1.4.0rc1 from file:///tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.4.0rc1-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Importing tensorflow with Python3 fails.
