How to use pre-trained models for fine tuning on different dataset ?

Hi,
I have downloaded a pre-trained model for inception v3 (inception_v3_2016_08_28.tar.gz file)from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim#Pretrained which contains the file inception_v3.ckpt. Could anyone please help me how to use this file to fine-tune on a different dataset ?
Thanks in advance.
