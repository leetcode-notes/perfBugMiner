NotFoundError while restoring inception_v3 model

Hi,
I am trying to make use of inception_v3 model from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim
After downloading the model as described in the webpage, I wanted to restore the model using
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.restore(sess, 'model/inception_v3.ckpt')

And I get this error:
NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Tensor name "InceptionV3/Mixed_6d/Branch_1/Conv2d_0c_7x1/biases" not found in checkpoint files model/inception_v3.ckpt

Upon inspection of tf.trainable_variables(), i find the variable with name -
"InceptionV3/Mixed_6d/Branch_1/Conv2d_0c_7x1/biases:0"

Is the suffix :0 causing this error ? If not how can i load this model ?
I raised this issue @tensorflow/models, but unfortunately, I did not get any response.
Thanks in advance!
