about how to conduct the tensor like the numpy or theao

I can get the result by numpy or theano,but for tensorflow it may not support this
How can I do to get the result that I want



import tensorflow as tf
x = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
y = [0,1]
z = [1,2]
x = tf.constant(x)
y = tf.constant(y)
z = tf.constant(z)
m = x[y,z]  # m = [2,6] is what I expect ,I just make a simple example ,Thanks
