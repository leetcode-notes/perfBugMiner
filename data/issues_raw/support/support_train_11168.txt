LSTMBlockCell variable names changed - old checkpoints cannot be restored

In TF 1.1 and earlier, bias and weights had the variable names "biases" and "weights" in the LSTMBlockCell.
Since TF 1.2, they have the variable names "bias" and "kernel".
Why was that changed? It makes all checkpoint files incompatible, but for no real reason.
