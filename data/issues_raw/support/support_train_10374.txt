Weird bugs after successful running until reboot computer

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
r0.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.2.3
CUDA/cuDNN version:
v4
GPU model and memory:
k80

Due to need debug some old Tensorflow code, i need to install TF0.9 version, after i installed, it could run code, everything goes okey. But after rebooting computer, run tensorflow code once, it can not run again, it trapped in tf.Session() funtion.
