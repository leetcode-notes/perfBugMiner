How can I change value by threshold in tensor?

When I do some 2-class classify practices, I use sigmoid as output layer, and it return a value in [0,1], but I want 1 if the value greater than 0.5,else set the value 0. I can't find a function to finish it.  Thank you for help.
Just like:
a=tf.constant([0.1,0.2,0.6,.0.7])--->turn to ---->a=tf.constant([0,0,1,1])
