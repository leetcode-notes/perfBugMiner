Keras + tensorflow + P100 : cudaErrorNotSupported = 71 error

Allow me please to cross post, upon sugestion, an error faced in using keras with tensorflow with machine equipped with P100 fchollet/keras#6054
Apologies if this has been reported already at some other place, I have been googling for it quite a bit, with my colleague without success.
While running the simple mnist example (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) with keras+tensorflow using P100 GPGPU we encounter an issue at the intersection of keras/tensorflow/cuda
Using TensorFlow backend.

we are using keras 2.0.2, tensorflow 1.0.0. cuda 8.0.53.
We seem to be having this issue both in python2.7.12 and python3.5.2 (keras 1.2 and 2.0 ...)
Bare tensorflow runtest are going fine, which lead us to think that this is really at the intersection of keras/tensorflow/cuda.
The same test runs fine on various machine with the same version of the software but with TitanX GPGPU.
seem to be tracing this back to

I am clueless on where to look next to solve this issue. I would greatly appreciate any feedback and guidance on this matter.
