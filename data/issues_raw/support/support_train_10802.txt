Decoding images in a given shape from TF records

I am trying to read images from TFrecords file. The images vary in shapes. After reading, I want to preserve their shape which is why I pass the height, width and depth parameters appropriately. But the code just doesn't print anything after the set_shape command. The sess.run() calls do not respond. I initialized the session in the main function and passed the object. Is there a way to get the values of height,w,d tensors so that I can pass it to set_shape? How do I fix this? Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance
`def read_and_decode(sess,filename_queue):
reader = tf.TFRecordReader()
_, serialized_example = reader.read(filename_queue)
features = tf.parse_single_example(
serialized_example,
# Defaults are not specified since both keys are required.
features={
'height': tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
'width': tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
'depth': tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
'image_raw': tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
'label': tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
})
image = tf.decode_raw(features['image_raw'], tf.uint8)
image.set_shape([sess.run(features['height']),sess.run(features['width']),sess.run(features['depth'])])`
