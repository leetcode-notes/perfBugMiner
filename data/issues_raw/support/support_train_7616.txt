Change device Placement of existing variable

How do I change the device placement of a tf.Variable() ?
I tried two methods
a = tf.Variable(1,name = 'a')  # a's device is not set
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
       a = tf.get_variable('a',1)   
# this creates a new variable on the gpu and doesn't change device assignment for a

I tried enforcing variable reuse by using tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()
a = tf.Variable(1,name = 'a')  # a's device is not set
tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
       a = tf.get_variable('a',1)   
# this creates a new variable on the gpu and doesn't change device assignment for a

This time, I get an error saying the variable 'a' did not exist in the gpu.
Any help on changing-device-placement or lazy-device-assignment would be appreciated. Thanks
