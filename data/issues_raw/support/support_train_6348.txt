Tensorflow library for python 3 not available from the suggested docker image

I noticed that tensorflow is not available from the standard gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow docker image.
I spun a docker container:
docker run -it --rm gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow bash

then I tried importing the Tensorflow from within python3:
root@dc7f436ca5e9:/notebooks# python3
Python 3.4.3 (default, Oct 14 2015, 20:28:29)
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow'

but the library is not available. Is this a bug or is this the intended feature? Does this mean I need to install tensorflow (for python3) myself with pip3 then in my own image? or maybe its a small bug?
