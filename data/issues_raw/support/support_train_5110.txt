Fail to export model with exporter with distributed session

We have try exporter and signature to export our TensorFlow models. The code works in standalone mode but not in distributed mode.
We got InvalidArgumentError when calling exporter.Exporter(saver).init(). It asks to feed the placeholder but it's not training process and I just want to get the op's name to pass as model's signatures. The error log looks like this.

Do anyone has tried to export models with distributed session? Here is my sample code if it helps.
