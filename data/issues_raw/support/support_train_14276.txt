Cannot interpret feed_dict key as tensor: tensor tensor(import/input:0, shape=(1, 299, 299, 3), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.

I'm running label_image.py given at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image.py on inception_resnet_v2 frozen graph. When I run this code it's giving me the following error
cannot interpret feed_dict key as tensor: tensor tensor(import/input:0, shape=(1, 299, 299, 3), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.
But when I print the tensors, there exists the above tensor in the graph. Could anyone please help me with this ? Thanks in advance.
