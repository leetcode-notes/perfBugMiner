is model ready when Fine-tuning in distributed case

When we finetune a model on a different task, only a part of vars in the model are restored from the pretrained task and others are left as initial values.
As many docs recommends(page1 page2), when training with a local graph, we restore the pretrained model after running the global init op(call restoring in "init_fn" if MonitoredSession or supervisor is included).
But in the distributed case, does global init op make "model_ready" returns true before the restoring-model called? other non-chief nodes will use the "not ready" values.
