could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR

Hi,
I installed tensorflow 1.0.1 GPU version on my Macbook Pro with GeForce GT 750M. Also installed CUDA 8.0.71 and cuDNN 5.1. I am running  a tf code that works fine with non CPU tensorflow but on GPU version , I get this error (once a while it works too).
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:975] Creating TensorFlow device (/gpu:0) -> (device: 0, name: GeForce GT 750M, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0)
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:397] could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR
E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:364] could not destroy cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM
F tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc:605] Check failed: stream->parent()->GetConvolveAlgorithms(&algorithms)
What is happening here? Is there a bug in tensorflow. Please advise.
Thanks
