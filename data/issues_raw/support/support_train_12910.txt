is_numeric_tensor on _ref variables

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce:

>>> X = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(5,5))
>>> X
<tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(5, 5) dtype=float64_ref>
>>> tf.is_numeric_tensor(X)
False
Describe the problem
I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, I feel it is a bug. I want to be able to test if an input to a function was a numpy style array or a tensor. I use the tf.is_numeric_tensor to check the input, however it doesn't pick up on _ref variables such as those initialized from a numpy array.
