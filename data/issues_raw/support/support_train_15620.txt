Tf Lite only support 4D l2_normalize?

I build some feature extract network model and converted tflite using by toco successfully.
But I got error "tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/l2norm.cc:47 NumDimensions(input) != 4 (2 != 4), when run interpreter->AllocateTensors().
I extract feature using by tf.nn.l2_normalize.
embeddings = tf.nn.l2_normalize(prelogits, 1, 1e-10, name='embeddings')
where prelogits is 2D tensor.
How can I extract normalized feature with tflite?
