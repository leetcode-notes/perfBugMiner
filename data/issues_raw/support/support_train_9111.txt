tensorflow installation issue

I have been following the Tensorflow installation guide to install tensorflow r.1.0. Since out network system does not have direct internet access to outside, so I installed it as following in the active virtualenv environment
(virtualenv-test) bash-4.1$ pip3 install -t --upgrade /data/pythonlibs/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
Processing /data/dsp_emerging/ugwz/pythonlibs/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl

However, I got the following error message, what does it mean?
