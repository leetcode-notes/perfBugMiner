Docker installation: version compatibility issues

I am trying to setup tensorflow in Windows 10 machine inside Docker.
The command I ran is:
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
Error response:
C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: client is newer than server (client API version: 1.24, server API version: 1.22).
Surprisingly, I did not get a lot many threads on this issue.
