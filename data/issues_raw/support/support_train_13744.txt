TensorFlow: lack of repeatability in tf.estimator.DNNClassifier

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

custom code: no, it is the one in https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator
system: Apple
OS: Mac OsX 10.13
TensorFlow version: 1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.3
GPU model: AMD FirePro D700 (actually, two such GPUs)
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Dear all,
I wish to use TensorFlow to perform classification on medical datasets.
To do this, I am using exactly the same code as that proposed in https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator, the only difference being that I face medical datasets rather than the Iris database. So, it is not custom code.
I do need help about the following problem: if I run the same code on the same data with the same parameters for the network configuration (number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, and so on) , the results are different. I mean, I run the same code ten times, and I obtain ten different values for the accuracy. These values are even largely different, as they range from 73% up to 83%.
This means that the subjects considered suffering from a given disease vary from a run to another. Differently said, once set a network structure, there are several subjects who are considered either healthy or sick depending on the run only.
As you can imagine, this lack of repeatability makes that code useless from both scientific and medical viewpoints: another user, running the same configuration over the same data set, would find a different model and different results, so would cure different subjects.
I have noticed that for the Iris database the problem seems not to take place, and accuracy is always 0.9666. This depends on the problem being very easy (linearly separable for all but one items, and very small data set).
I have carried out a search on the internet, and I have found several other people who have noted the same problem. As for the possible solutions, I have read several as well, I have implemented them all, with no result.
Here I add a short list of some suggested remedies that failed in my case:
os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '0'
np.random.seed(0)
tf.set_random_seed(0)
rn.seed(0)
tf.reset_default_graph()
session_conf = tf.ConfigProto(
intra_op_parallelism_threads=1,
inter_op_parallelism_threads=1
)
sess = tf.Session(graph=tf.get_default_graph(), config=session_conf)
Is there any chance to fix this problem? It is a pity that such an excellent tool, as TensorFlow is, cannot guarantee repeatibility.
I am using TensorFlow 1.3.0, Python 3.6.3, and an Apple with Mac OsX 10.13.
Thank you very much!
Best regards
