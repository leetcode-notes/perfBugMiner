Tensorflow value error when setting up training_data

Hey, I'm trying to feed a csv to tf.contrib.learn and running into a ValueError over and over again. Here's my code for the training_set variable, plus the ensuing error:
training_set = tf.contrib.learn.datasets.base.load_csv_with_header(
filename = MET_TRAINING,
target_dtype = np.float,
features_dtype = np.str)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#15>", line 4, in 
features_dtype = np.str)
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/base.py", line 48, in load_csv_with_header
n_samples = int(header[0])
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'conflict'
The .csv file contains mostly strings, but post training I'd like tf to give me either a '0' or '1' depending on the category an text example ought to fall in. Suggestions on what to do from here?
