Error when creating a summary inside a tf.while_loop in a multi-GPU setup (like CIFAR-10)

Why diagnosing a problem with batch normalized RNNs, I tried to add a summary of the population statistics in my batch normalized cell, but then when I try to run the merged summaries I get the following error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: The node 'Merge/MergeSummary' has inputs from different frames. The input 'tower_2/rnn/while/multi_rnn_cell/cell_4/gru_cell/gates/r/rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_4/gru_cell/gates/r/pop_var_0' is in frame 'tower_2/rnn/while/tower_2/rnn/while/'. The input 'tower_3/rnn/while/multi_rnn_cell/cell_4/gru_cell/gates/r/rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_4/gru_cell/gates/r/pop_var_0' is in frame 'tower_3/rnn/while/tower_3/rnn/while/'.
This is on TensorFlow 1.0. I'll try to get a reduced testcase.
