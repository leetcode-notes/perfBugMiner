In ExponentialMovingAverage class in python/training/moving_averages.py, which op will first be executed,  opt_op or maintain_average_op?

Recently, I checked the code about moving averages. But I confused about which operation will first be executed, the opt_op which apply the gradient to the variable, or the maintain_average_op which maintain and update the shadow variable? I find that the following code:
with tf.control_dependencies([opt_op]): training_op = tf.group(maintain_averages_op)
training_op depends on both opt_op and maintain_averages_op. But how about the relation of opt_op   and maintain_averages_op? Which one will be executed first?
