Get variable mapping (dictionary) after checkpoint restore

It is a feature request.
Please provide a way to get the list of Tensorflow variables restored from a checkpoint and corresponding Python variables.
More info:
Consider that you have this code:
    matrix_1 = tf.Variable([[1, 2], [3, 4]], name="matrix1")
    matrix_2 = tf.Variable([[5, 6], [7, 8]], name="matrix2")

When a tensorflow checkpoint is created it has matrix1 and matrix2 variables saved. It is easy to understand that matrix1 (in TF namespace) corresponds to matrix_1 (in Python namespace).
Now consider that the code is:
    matrix_1 = tf.Variable([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    matrix_2 = tf.Variable([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

A tensorflow checkpoint will have Variable_1:0 and Variable_2:0 variables saved. And it is not obvious at all that Variable_1:0 (in TF namespace) corresponds to matrix_1 (in Python namespace). Especially if there are dozens of variables.
There should be a way to get a list of corresponding variables. For example:
Variable_1 = matrix_1
Variable_2 = matrix_2
...
Variable_100 = relu_1_weights
