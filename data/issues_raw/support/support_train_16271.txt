tf.pow(x, y) edge case with negative x (Bug)

I am using tf.pow for my project, but my losses are 'nan', so I setup the test cases as shown below.
I found that whenever x is negative, tf.pow seems to output nan instead of the correct answer.



r = tf.pow(0.4,0.4)
r2 = tf.pow(-0.4,-0.4)
r3 = tf.pow(0.4,-0.4)
r4 = tf.pow(-0.4,0.4)
sess.run(r)
0.69314486
sess.run(r2)
nan
sess.run(r3)
1.4426999
sess.run(r4)
nan



I appreciate for anyone of the community who can address this issue.
