tf.Estimator creates loss and loss_1 for eval/train

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 14.12
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.4
Python version:
2.7

Describe the problem
When using the tf.Estimator, the summary files save out summaries for the loss variable evaluated every checkpoint.  The summary for the training, is saved as 'loss_1' .  I got this tensorboard by running the ciphar10_estimator code located: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10_estimator/
This makes it difficult to compare the eval/train loss on the same graph in tensorboard.  What causes this naming issue and what can be done to fix it?
Thanks!
