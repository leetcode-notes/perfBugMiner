Java API: How to implement a PlaceHolder

I've been loving experimenting with @asimshankar 's Java API, and finally got it working tonight with a model that i've trained myself based of of inception. However, I noticed his comment in his tutorial/demo java class that says:

Since the graph is being constructed once per execution here, we can use a constant for the input image. If the graph were to be re-used for multiple input images, a placeholder would have been more appropriate.

I'd be very interested in seeing how to do this with the java API. I want to be able to optimize using the same graph for a bunch of images which would be fed into the graph in real-time, so optimization is important. Would a modification to the graph be necessary in order to use a placeholder, or is it just a different manipulation of the API? I couldn't find any references to a placeholder class or method. Any help is much appreciated.
