No module named 'tensorflow.contrib.keras.datasets'

In the documentation, in order to import Keras dataset, you have to
import tensorflow.contrib.keras.datasets
But instead, it only works when
import tensorflow.contrib.keras.python.keras.datasets
I think this problem would occur not just for datasets but anything else in Keras.
