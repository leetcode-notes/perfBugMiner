Tensorflow splitting?

I want to split tensor into two parts:
ipdb> mean_log_std
<tf.Tensor 'pi/add_5:0' shape=(?, 2) dtype=float32>

Context: ? is for number of samples and the other dimension is 2. I want to split along the second dimension into two tensorflow of shape 1 along that dimension.
What I tried?(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/slice)
ipdb> tf.slice(mean_log_std,[0,2],[0,1])
<tf.Tensor 'pi/Slice_6:0' shape=(0, 1) dtype=float32>
ipdb> tf.slice(mean_log_std,[0,1],[0,1])
<tf.Tensor 'pi/Slice_7:0' shape=(0, 1) dtype=float32>
ipdb>

I would expect the shape to be (?,1) and (?,1) for the above two splits.
