Three questions about ChiefSessionCreator?

There are two parameters of ChiefSessionCreator: checkpoint_dir and checkpoint_filename_with_path,
what difference between them?


And ChiefSessionCreator has a parameter scaffold which has a parameter saver, does it mean ChiefSessionCreator uses scaffold.saver to save and restore variables?


And scaffold also has a parameter init_fn, and it can be used like
init_fn=assign_from_checkpoint_fn, assign_from_checkpoint_fn will new a saver with the parameter var_list of assign_from_checkpoint_fn. So here comes another question, ChiefSessionCreator will use scaffold.saver to restore variables or init_fn?


To answer the three questions above, you may need read the source code, but I am not capable to do it, so I need your help. Thanks.
