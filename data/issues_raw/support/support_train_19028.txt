Is it possible to parepare two set of weights for feedforward and backprop separately?

Currently I'm working on the network quantization and I try to implement the ideas of the paper "Mixed precision training" using tensorflow. In this paper, the author prepare two set of weights (with different data type) for feedforward and backprop separately. I want to know if current tensorflow can support this kind of feature. Thanks.
