Describe the problem
The LICENSE file in the tensorflow github repository has an incorrect copyright assignment.
The first line of the file reads:
Copyright 2017 The TensorFlow Authors.  All rights reserved.
This is incorrect.  "The TensorFlow Authors" are not the copyright holders for the Apache 2.0 license.
This line should be removed.  It makes a legal claim which is expressly false.
A separate issue is whether the line in the LICENSE file which provides an example of how to attribute
the copyright for new code in the TensorFlow project (which also includes a line assigning copyright
to "The TensorFlow Authors") is incorrect as well.
In general I can't see how the copyright assignment works in the project.  Yuan Tang was recently
added to the AUTHORS file.  Does that person now have full copyright over the entire TensorFlow
work?  The Contributor agreement only grants a copyright license to Google and the downstream
recipients of the code.  It does not grant copyright to the contributed code.
