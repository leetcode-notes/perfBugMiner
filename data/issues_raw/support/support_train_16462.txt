How to create a model checkpoint based on each step rather than time interval.? using TensorFlow-Slim api.

slim.learning.train(
train_op,
logdir,
number_of_steps=1000,
save_summaries_secs=300,
save_interval_secs=600):
The above api only supports to capture model checpoints periodically, but I need to checkpoint based on each step. How do achieve this using TesorFlow-Slim API.?
I am looking for parameters like this:
save_summaries_steps = 10,
save_interval_steps=10
where the value 10 is the number of steps and that should be configurable.
