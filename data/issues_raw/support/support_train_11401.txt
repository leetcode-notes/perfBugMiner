cuDNN version issues

I am trying to train a ConvNet on my Windows laptop and I got this error.
Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 5005 (compatibility version 5000) but source was compiled with 5105 (compatibility version 5100).  If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime matches a compatible version specified during compile configuration.
I am already using cudnn v5.1, so I have no clue why this is happening
