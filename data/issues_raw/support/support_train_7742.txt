Improve retrained inception v3 in Android demo

I have retrained the Inception-V3 final layer with my own 20 categories. When I am using retrained model in android demo app it takes 6 to 8 seconds to predict.
Running (using armeabi-v7a) on

LG G4 Stylus -> 6-8 sec
S6, -> 3-4.5 sec

I have done optimize_for_inference it takes 6-9 sec and quantize_graph it takes 7-11 sec. Is there any way to improve it?
Output on LG G4 Stylus.
