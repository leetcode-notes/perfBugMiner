TF_GraphImportGraphDef breaks down while importing graphs with control flow ops

I've encountered issues when trying to load graphs from python which contain
dropout or batch norm. In the following example:
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float64, [None, 3])

    w = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([3, 3], dtype=tf.float64))
    h = tf.matmul(x, w)

    is_training = tf.Variable(True, trainable=False)
    h_dropout = tf.contrib.layers.dropout(h, keep_prob=0.5, is_training=is_training)
TF_GraphImportGraphDef breaks down and I get the following message:
SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000000013539dcac, pid=23288, tid=0x0000000000006a1b
C  [libtensorflow.dylib+0x14cac]  tensorflow::shape_inference::InferenceContext::Rank(tensorflow::shape_inference::ShapeHandle) const+0x1c
The same happens if I replace dropout operation with batch norm:
tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm(h, center=True, scale=True, is_training=is_training)
It seems to me this problem is related to the presence of control flow ops.
