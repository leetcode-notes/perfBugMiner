wide&deep tutorial for large data.

When i apply the wide&deep tutorial  code to much larger dataset with millions of rows, I received
[libprotobuf ERROR google/protobuf/io/zero_copy_stream_impl_lite.cc:173] Cannot allocate buffer larger than kint32max for StringOutputStream.
or sometimes
ValueError: GraphDef cannot be larger than 2GB.
Any simple fix?  I pretty much want to apply the combined classifier in the tutorial.
