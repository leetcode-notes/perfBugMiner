How could I get the weights from the checkpoint file saved using tensorflow-slim?

I know that if I knew the variable names or graph I could restore the graph or the variables in the checkpoint files.
But if I don't know the actual variable names  like w1,w2,b1,b2...in conv1,conv2,....
How could I get the variable values?
For example, I get the checkpoint file of alexnet in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets/alexnet.py
How could I get the variable values in these checkpoint files?
