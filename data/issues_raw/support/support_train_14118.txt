How to print shape of tensors in tf.contrib.learn.Estimator

tf.contrib.learn.Estimator and tf.contrib.learn.Experiment  are very convenience to build a model. But how to debug the user defined model? For example, in the Abalone Age Predictor example, how to print shape of 'first_hidden_layer', 'second_hidden_layer' and 'predictions' in user defined 'model_fn' function?
It is easy to print  shape of tensors if we build a model with session, and an example is as follows:
a = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=(2, 3, 4))) with tf.Session() as sess: print sess.run(tf.shape(a))
By the way, I also tried to debug  Abalone Age Predictor example, with tf.python.debug.LocalCLIDebugHook, but 'first_hidden_layer', 'second_hidden_layer' and 'predictions' are not in debug window.
Many thanks in advance.
