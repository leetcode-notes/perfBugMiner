No graph definition files were found.

hello I was learn to use the tensorflow, Now I can run softmax , nn , cnn and other model on it , this is a really good framework.
but now I suffered some problem.
I want to use the tensorboard, this is my code:
https://github.com/catpanda/tensorflow_demo/blob/master/minist/mnist_bp.py
you can see the result is very good. to celebrate that. I want to show them in graph.You see I use writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('board/', graph=graph) in line 56 and define the graph in line 53. then I run the tensorboard by tensorboard --logdir='board/'.

but the page shows No graph definition files were found.ã€‚

I use tensorflow on windows10 and by python3.5 and tensorflow1.2 I hope you can help me find out what is the problem.
