Unable to restore inception v3 retrained model

I'm retraining the inception v3 model on my image dataset. I use tf.Saver() to store the model at the time of best validation accuracy. But when I'm using the stored model to do the validation again, I don't get the same accuracy.
Please let me know if I'm missing anything specifically with inception v3 model. I want store the entire inception v3 graph along with newly added layers, so that I can reuse it normally.
code snippet :
saver.save(sess=sess, save_path=save_path + "best_valid", global_step=i)
Thanks,
Rohit
