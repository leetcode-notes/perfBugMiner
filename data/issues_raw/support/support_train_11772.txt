Feature request: have optimizers handle complex tensors

When a tensor that contains complex values reaches an optimizer, it is cast to real.
This means that the net will not learn features that depend on the imaginary part of the tensor.
While we wait for the possible feature, is there a workaround that you recommend? I'm thinking of separating the real and imaginary parts before feeding the optimizer (like, turning a complex tensor [C] into [R,I]), would that work?).
