no input tensor in mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.ckpt

I am newbie in TF and slim. Sorry if this a basic question. I downloaded mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.ckpt, built latest TF and TF-slim tree and ran tensorflow/tensorflow/python/tools/inspect_checkpoint.py on it.
I dont find input tensors, that are usually 224,224,3 or 112,112,3 etc size. Am I missing something here?
