Training doesn't start when using batch_normalization,

I am following the article.
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/batch_normalization
When I use the below code, the training doesn't start.
update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS) with tf.control_dependencies(update_ops): train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
