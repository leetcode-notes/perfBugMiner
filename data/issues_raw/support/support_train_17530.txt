Feature request:  Increase kMaxEagerParentSize or make it python version dependent

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
N/A (problem occurs on startup)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tip of tree
Python version:
3.6 (from source)
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.10.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
4.8.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:
unused
GPU model and memory:
n/a
Exact command to reproduce:
import tensorflow

Describe the problem
We wanted to evaluate our patches in Valgrind, so we made a custom build of python 3.6 from source (it's more valgrind-friendly), then compiled TensorFlow against that.
When this done, 'import tensorflow' fails on a python exception because the size of the base class of EagerTensor in Python 3.6 is greater than kMaxEagerParentSize.
Issue #16836 was opened on this a month ago, but closed by its creator.  When we encountered this problem, we found that we could simply set the value of kMaxEagerParentSize to 48 and everything would run with no obvious issues.
Is there a reason that kMaxEagerParentSize must always equal 32, or can it be increased, or possibly even adjusted depending on which version of python TensorFlow is being compiled for?
