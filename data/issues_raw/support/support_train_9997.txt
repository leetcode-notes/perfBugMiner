Describe the problem
In mnist_softmax.py,there is a difference between github an the web of Tensorflow(https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html),and the code on github has error in line 57,58.
Source code / logs
I replaced cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(y, y_)) with cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(-tf.reduce_sum(y_ * tf.log(y), reduction_indices=[1])).And it works.
