tf.contrib.distributions.percentile returning AttributeError

Hello,
I am trying to utilize tf.contrib.distributiions.percentile as described in:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/distributions/percentile

OS Platform and Distribution :  Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from binary
TensorFlow version : 1.2.0
Python version: 3.4.5

My invocation is as follows:
pctl_val = tf.contrib.distributions.percentile(grad_values, pctl)
Here is the error message that I get:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'percentile'
I understand that the percentile feature was not available in 1.1.0 and it is now available in 1.2.0. Still, why do I get the error?
