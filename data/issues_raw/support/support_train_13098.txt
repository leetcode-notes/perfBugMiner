Describe the problem
This is the tracing result when I executed ptb-lstm application. I wonder the meaning of "sequence_loss_by_example/add/_1077".
I wanted to create enqueue and dequeue ops for "sequence_loss_by_example/add", but dequeue op is never called, and different node name appears in the tracing file.
Can you let me know what is happened inside session.run?
