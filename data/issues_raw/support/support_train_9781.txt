Changing default type from tf.int32 to tf.int64

I am trying to allocate very large variables inside single-box, but the default out_type of some operators are tf.int32, it's too small as most modern data center machines have more than 100G memory.
Here is the operators I found:
tf.shape(input, name=None, out_type=tf.int32)
tf.size(input, name=None, out_type=tf.int32)
tf.shape_n(input, out_type=None, name=None), out_type defaults to tf.int32
For example if I have one [500000000000] tensor, tf.shape fails with the following error message inside Windows:

OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long

Linux has the same issue and chooses overflow instead of raising exceptions.
