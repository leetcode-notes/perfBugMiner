Neural Net regression in Tensorflow

Describe the problem
Hi, I am trying to perform a Neural Network in tensorflow for The Bike-Sharing-Dataset with a regresion model. I checked out the tensorflow tutorials but I couldn't find  a solution. Something's wrong with the tf.matmul() and the input and  targets matrix.
Source code / logs
Here is my repository and the dataset.
Thanks so much!
