Fine tune inception without TFRecords.

I wonder if I can fine-tune the inception model without using TFRecords format for my dataset in the inception_train script. I have a placeholder for images and a placeholder for labels and during training I feed them in sess.run(). I get low precision on a binary classification problem so I wonder if this approach is wrong. In stackoverflow noone answered. Thanks in advance!
