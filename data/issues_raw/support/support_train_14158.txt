Android - No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Cos' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:                                                                        <no registered kernels>                                                                                                                                            	 [[Node: stft/hann_window/Cos = Cos[T=DT_FLOAT, _device="/device:CPU:0"](stft/hann_window/truediv)]]

I've exported a model to Android that uses :
stfts = tf.contrib.signal.stft(transwav, frame_length=2048, frame_step=512,
fft_length=2048,window_fn=functools.partial(tf.contrib.signal.hann_window, periodic=False), pad_end=True)
the model works properly in pyhton
but when i load it in Android using the downloaded compiled tensorflow - compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:+'
I get this error -
FATAL EXCEPTION: main
Process: org.tensorflow.demo, PID: 25836
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Cos' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
 	 [[Node: stft/hann_window/Cos = CosT=DT_FLOAT, _device="/device:CPU:0"]]
which comes from the hann_window
any recommended work around?
