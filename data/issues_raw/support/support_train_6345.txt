Udacity LSTM: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'concat_v2'

I'm going through the udacity deep learning class and getting an error when evaluating
logits = tf.nn.xw_plus_b(tf.concat_v2(outputs, 0), w, b)
which was changed in d4eb834#diff-e4eb32d9f7b7f06d7547050e1ce3d937
>>> import tensorflow
>>> tensorflow.__version__
'0.12.0-rc1'
>>> tensorflow.concat_v2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'concat_v2'
>>> tensorflow.concat
<function concat at 0x10bc03730>

I installed and am running the latest release rc1 where concat_v2 was added in 4564322, has anyone else seen this?  Thanks in advance!
