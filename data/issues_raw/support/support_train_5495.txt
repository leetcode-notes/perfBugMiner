Modifying the convolution operation

Hi,
I wanted to test a modification to the convolutional operation. Which files should I change in the source code to implement and test my modifications? I have seen some low level .cc code which seems to implement convolutions. However, I'm not sure about exactly which files I should modify to implement my modification.
Also is there a cleaner way (as in, a high-level pythonic way) to  test modifications to the convolutional operation without losing out on the speed of Tensorflow?
Thanks!
