tf.random_crop  assert erroneously

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0
GPU model and memory:TitanX Geforce 16G
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I use tf.random_crop for image augmentation, the original image was "232x232x3" rgb image. when I try to do random_crop it to "224x224x3",  the assert occurs  as following, seems very strange:
"InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): assertion failed: [Need value.shape >= size, got ] [232 232 3] [224 224 3]"
Source code / logs
    def img_augmentation(self, image_tensor):
        # resize image
        resize_image = tf.image.resize_images(
             image_tensor, [self.IMAGE_HEIGHT, self.IMAGE_WIDTH], method=0, align_corners=False)
        padded_image = tf.image.pad_to_bounding_box(
            resize_image, 4, 4, self.IMAGE_HEIGHT+8, self.IMAGE_WIDTH+8)
        print "padded_image shape:", padded_image.get_shape()
        # random crop image
        distorted_image = tf.random_crop(
            padded_image,  [self.IMAGE_HEIGHT, self.IMAGE_WIDTH, self.NUM_CHANNELS])
