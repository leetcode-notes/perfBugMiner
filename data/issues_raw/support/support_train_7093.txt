problems with Model saving and program slow to run

github_text_classification.zip
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
I tried to run the text_classification.py provided as one of the examples. But I basically ran into 2 problems:
1: The program took hours to finish (which just took minutes with version r0.8/0.9) and issued lots of warnings. Please run text_classification.py and the corresponding output is attached as output.PNG.
2: Problems with saving models by using classifier = learn.DNNClassifier(..., model_dir). Please run text_classification_with_model_saving.py and the corresponding output is attached as output_with_model_saving.PNG.
Environment info (Operating System):

#6119
The person tried to solve a different problem. But the warnings he got were almost the same as I got. He seemed to fix his problem by updating the tensorflow to version r0.12.1, which is the one I'm using now.

The person also got almost the same warnings and errors. He got rid of all those by reverting back to version r0.10.0. But this is the last resort I would want.

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
ls: cannot access '/path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*': No such file or directory
If installed from binary pip package, provide:


A link to the pip package you installed:
Running the command line pip show tensorflow gives the following:
Name: tensorflow
Version: 0.12.1
Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Requires: mock, numpy, protobuf, wheel, six


The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
0.12.1
python version: 2.7.12
numpy version: 1.11.3


What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I manipulated parameters for learn.DNNClassifier for a little bit, but still got the error.

Other Notes
The original script appears to download corrupted dbpedia files. For convenience, I used my train and test csv files, and added my code for importing data files from Line 86 to Line 89. The two csv files are also attached. When running the scripts, please place the two data files in the same directory as the two scripts.
I ran both scripts in the CLI, e.g., python text_classification.py
