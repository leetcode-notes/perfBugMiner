Bug: expected_shape not work in tensorflow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): mac osx
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7.0
Python version:  3.5.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce: None

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I try to use a variable without shape in tensorflow. My code is
sen_var_1 = tf.Variable(np.float32, trainable=False, validate_shape=False, expected_shape=[None, None, 300])
sen_1 = tf.placeholder(shape=[None, None, 300], dtype=np.float32, name="q1")
sen_assign_1 = tf.assign(sen_var_1, sen_1, validate_shape=False)

I will run session with sen_assign_1 when train begin, and each epoch I want to use sen_var_1. But it seems that expected_shape is not work in sen_var_1. So is there any way to do this?

ValueError: Input size (depth of inputs) must be accessible via shape inference, but saw value None.
