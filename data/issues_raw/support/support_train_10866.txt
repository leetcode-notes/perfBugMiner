word2vec error sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'

Im tring to run the code :
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py#L117
But get the exception on the Line 117
as
sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'
I want to ask if this really a problem in the tensorflow file or its just me facing this error.
