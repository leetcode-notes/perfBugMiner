Merging inception retrained models

Hi,
I know this might not be the place to ask this but I did not get any replies nor comments on SO so I thought to give it a shot.
I have done my own training of tensorflow inception a while ago, recently I wanted to add new classes to the original model. However, when I retrain tensorflow it generates a new graph and labels files completely separate from the older one.
Is there a way to combine models? Or do I have to retrain again with the old and new classes?
