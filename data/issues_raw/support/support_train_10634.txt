Cannot find Eigen source code

I got confused by the directory structure after I compiled the code.
There are some folders starting with bazel-, so what are they?
I want to find where is the source code for Eigen library (e.g., implementation for extract_image_patches function) and I want to change some lines inside.
Currently I only found them under bazel-tensorflow/external/eigen_archive/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11, but bazel-tensorflow is a soft link and it points to a tmp dir on my mac where I found there's a README file says

This directory was generated by Blaze.
Do not attempt to modify or delete any files in this directory.

So, where is the original source code for Eigen so I can modify it?
I guess this question is better to be asked on stackoverflow but I tried there is no reply.
I hope I won't waste too much of your time. It's a very quick question I suppose :)
