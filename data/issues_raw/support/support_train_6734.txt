Can not register user_ops in Android APP

Hello!
I want to user some user ops, such as roi_pooling.cc in Android. I build my Android project by Bazel, just like the Tensorflow Android demo, but I seems Android does build user_ops, the logcat shows as following:
tensorflow_inference_jni.cc:146 Could not create TensorFlow graph: Not found: Op type not registered 'RoiPooling'
Is it a bug or how can I solve this problem?
Thank you in advance for your help.
