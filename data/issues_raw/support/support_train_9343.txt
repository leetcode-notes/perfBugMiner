Android Demo app & Yolo 2 - OutOfMemoryError

I have successfully run Android Demo with Tiny Yolo (graph-tiny-yolo-voc.pb - 60mb),:
  private static final String YOLO_MODEL_FILE = "file:///android_asset/graph-yolo-voc.pb";
  private static final int YOLO_INPUT_SIZE = 416;
  private static final String YOLO_INPUT_NAME = "input";
  private static final String YOLO_OUTPUT_NAMES = "output";
  private static final int YOLO_BLOCK_SIZE = 32;
  private static final boolean USE_YOLO = true;

I also decided to try Yolo 2 (graph-yolo-voc.pb - 193mb),
but I get OutOfMemoryError when I run TF Detect
My phone has 3 GB of RAM
But I know that is just android java limit and has nothing to do with current available/free memory
and we can use NDK to bypass this limit.
I also tried to run with:
     <activity android:name="org.tensorflow.demo.DetectorActivity"
                  android:largeHeap="true"

but didn't help
And also:
<activity android:name="org.tensorflow.demo.DetectorActivity"
                  android:largeHeap="true"
                  android:hardwareAccelerated="false"

App runs ok, but nothing happens, it just shows black screen, no camera frames..
Is there a way to run app with big .pb files?
TensorFlowInferenceInterface needs AssetManager and string file name, then I guess it just uses default java IO to read file,
mb it's better to process all of this with NDK somehow?
