Can Tensorflow build complex probablistic graph model ?

Hello. I am surprised by the optimization ability of tensorflow, and want tensorflow to solve more math models. However, I find few articles about how to build  complex probablistic graph model fast and simple. Are there any ideas about introducing tensorflow into complex general probablistic graph model field?
