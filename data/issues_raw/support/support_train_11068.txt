Global Variables of graph not loaded on different computer

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):l
MacOSx :
TensorFlow installed from binary (pip install):
Tensorflow version 1.1.0

Describe the problem
I have been having issues trying to load a model from a checkpoint file. When trying to access any of the global variables created in our tensorflow model (for example print sess.run(W), we get an error

NameError: global name 'W' is not defined

We expect W and other global variables to be present, but none are. Thanks for the help.

        init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            sess.run(init_op)
            saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('FinalTensorflowModel/model.ckpt.meta')
            saver.restore(sess,"FinalTensorflowModel/model.ckpt")
            print sess.run(W)
            for idx, row in df.iterrows():
                profitability = tf.matmul(row,W) + b
                print sess.run(profitability)
