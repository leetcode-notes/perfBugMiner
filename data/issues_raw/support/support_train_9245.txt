AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.contrib.seq2seq' has no attribute 'rnn_decoder'

System information

OS and Env: Windows 7, Python 3.5.1
TensorFlow installed from: binary, pip install tensorflow
TensorFlow version: 1.0.1

Describe the problem
After upgrading from TF 0.9 to TF 1.0.1, am unable to find seq2seq.rnn_decoder(). Updated the imports to include seq2seq module (TF 0.9: tensorflow.python.ops, TF 1.0: tensorflow.contrib).
On exploring the new API, I noticed a similar function: dynamic_rnn_decoder. Unfortunately, dynamic_rnn_decoder has different signature than rnn_decoder, and a simple function name change fails.
The Ask
What's the equivalent of seq2seq.rnn_decoder() in TF 1.0+?
Source code (TF 0.9)
seq2seq.rnn_decoder(inputs_split, self.initial_state, self.cell, loop_function=loop if test else None, scope='lstm_vars')
