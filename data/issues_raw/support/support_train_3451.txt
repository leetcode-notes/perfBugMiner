retrain.py validation and testing evaluation seems incorrect

While retrain new final layer is added which has name defined by FLAGS.final_tensor_name. Strangely while evaluating against ground truths instead of using final_tensor_name or final_matmul it still uses output of ''validation_bottlenecks'.
validation_accuracy = sess.run(
evaluation_step,
feed_dict={bottleneck_input: validation_bottlenecks,
ground_truth_input: validation_ground_truth})
