tensorflow MNIST getting error IOError: Not a gzipped file

When I try to run the basic tutorial example I get this as a return:
Traceback (most recent call last):

IOError: Not a gzipped file
I uninstalled tensorflow and reinstalled tensor flow with no results.
I have seen some information about installing the file locally, but then how do import the data? I am rather new to python so I do not know how to do this.
Thanks!
