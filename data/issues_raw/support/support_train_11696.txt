tf.Print return type

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.2.1
Python version:
2.7
Exact command to reproduce:

a = tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]])
partitions = tf.dynamic_partition(a,range(a.shape[0]),a.shape[0])
print(type(partitions)) # <type 'list'>
partitions = tf.Print(partitions,[partitions],"partition is:") # prints the list
print(type(partitions)) # <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'>

Describe the problem
tf.Print is supposed to be an identity operation so I assume it should not change type from list to Tensor. If we are not supposed to pass a list, it should raise an error instead of changing the type.
