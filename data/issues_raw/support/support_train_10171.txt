tf.contrib.rnn.decoder does not require explicitly build encoder?

As a beginner to tensorflow, I need to build a LSTM encoder decoder framework for images.
The tf.contrib.seq2seq.decoder does not require explicitly build encoder? Does it take the output from previous step as input? Thus the decoder_inputs are actually the input for encoder?
