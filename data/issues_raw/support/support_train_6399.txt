Make an op compute its input once and hold.

Currently, tf.constant can take NumPy arrays as input, but it cannot take TensorFlow tensors as input. It would be useful to allow tf.constant to take tensors (that change with every evaluation, e.g. the tensor created by a dequeue op) and turn it into a constant tensor by evaluating the input tensor only once.
