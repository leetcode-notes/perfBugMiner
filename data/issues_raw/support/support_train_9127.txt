How to reinitialize state prior to inference with RNN

I have an RNN graph which has been trained in TF with good accuracy, but when it runs in Android (using libtensorflow_inference.so) it runs poorly.  I have a hypothesis that the problem is due to the statefulness of the RNN.  It is my understanding that during training the RNN state is reinitialized to a fresh state with each minibatch.  However, when running in reallife, it is running continuously without the state being refreshed.  Thus causing anomalous results.
Is there a way to force the state to be refreshed when running in an Android environment?  I note that the java interface (tensorflowinferenceinterface.java) has no such method.
I have also documented this inquiry in SO nine days ago, but had no response: link.
