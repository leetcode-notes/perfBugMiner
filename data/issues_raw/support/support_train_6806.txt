convert_graphdef_memmapped_format produces corrupt graphs

I tried memory mapping an exported/frozen graph. Let's say the graph is named graph.pb. After converting the graph like this
./path/to/convert_graphdef_memmapped_format --in_graph=graph.pb --out_graph=graph_mmap.pb

I get

Converted 16 nodes for an unquantized graph
Converted 0 nodes for the 8bit quantized version of the graph

If I try to load any of these output files using the C++ API ReadBinaryProto and then Run the graph the following errors occur

Unquantized: Session was not created with a graph before Run()
Quantized: Out of range: Read less bytes than requested

so I guess the output file is a corrupt protobuf file (or a different version).
