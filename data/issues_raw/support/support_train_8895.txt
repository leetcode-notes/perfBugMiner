image_retraining/retrain.py not found

Environment info
Operating System: Windows 10
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:

cuda_8.0.61_win10.exe
cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v5.1
I have installed tensorflow for gpu using pip install tensorflow-gpu( also downloaded the nightly for vanishing certain warnings)
tensorflow_gpu-1.1.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

What am I trying to do?
I want to use the tensorflow for poets for transfer learning on my images ## ### WITHOUT USING DOCKER
What my problem is?
The tensorflow directory in the site-packages does not have the image_retraining folder at all.
But the tensorflow-master-cpu on github has examples/image_retraining. It has many other files and directories.
My question is..
Can I copy and paste the tensorflow/examples/image_retraining or the tensorflow subfolder to my tensorflow folder in site-packages?
or
Do I install tensorflow for cpu ? Will the retraining work?
I don't want to use docker. Please help me @Carmezim
