tf.get_variable() cannot recognize existing variables

with tf.variable_scope("conv", reuse=True): x = tf.get_variable("w",[1])
The above code cannot recognize an existing variable, but clearly the existing variable was created before as print out of the variable .name shows : conv/w:0
I get an error when using tf.get_variable:
ValueError: Under-sharing: Variable conv/w does not exist, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=None in VarScope?
If set to reuse=None...
with tf.variable_scope("conv", reuse=None): x = tf.get_variable("w",[1])
Then it creates another variable with .name  conv/w_1:0
It's a bug! Now I have 2 variables, with names 'conv/w'  and 'conv/w_1'
