Tensorflow on AMD - specific chips

Hi
I live abroad so the choice in hardware is more limited here. I only have the below option for graphics card, but from reading i find it hard to figure out if tensorflow would work w this or not. Some threads say that it works with "newer ones from AMD", others say "it requires a lot of setup". Can anyone say if tensorflow can run of the gpu of the below "out of the box"?
AMD Radeon Pro WX 4150 w/4GB GDDR5
