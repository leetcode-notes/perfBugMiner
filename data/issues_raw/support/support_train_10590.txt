Saving embeddings or output evaluations in parallel to training

Feature request to create an async embedding saving buffer, which runs on the processor while the code trains on a GPU
The aim would be make sure that training is not affected by saving the model. That anyway takes a single thread, therefore it is a process that is done using an async buffer, it could optimize the training of models.
