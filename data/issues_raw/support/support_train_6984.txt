API changes: Missing RNN module

This is a continuation #6973.  Given the ongoing API changes with r0.12 and the shortage of documentation/samples, it seems that API questions must be posed here.
We had previously working code as follows:
lstm_cell_1 = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(n_hidden)
outputs, states = tf.nn.rnn(lstm_cell_1, Xnew, dtype=tf.float32)

The new code should be something like:
lstm_cell_1 = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(n_hidden)
outputs, states = tf.contrib.rnn(lstm_cell_1, Xnew, dtype=tf.float32)

But tf.contrib.rnn no longer exists.  I've tried tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell and tf.contrib.rnn.fused_rnn_cell but am told that TypeError: 'module' object is not callable.
What is the new method to fuse together Basic LSTM cells?
