HistogramSummary  not support fp16 ？

There is a issue when I train my model with adm optimizer (tf.train.AdamOptimizer),  It seems HistogramSummary not support DT_HALF.
2017-11-24 09:19:36.954820: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1192] Invalid argument: Infinity in summary histogram for: local4/BatchNorm/beta_1
[[Node: local4/BatchNorm/beta_1 = HistogramSummary[T=DT_HALF, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](local4/BatchNorm/beta_1/tag, local4/BatchNorm/beta/read/_171)]]
But if i use the other optimizer such as GradientDescentOptimizer or RMSPropOptimizer， there is no the issue above.  I don't know why,  Is there anyone meet this error
