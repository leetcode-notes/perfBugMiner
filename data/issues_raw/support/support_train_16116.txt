Implement Scale Operate??

System information

Have I written custom code: N/A:
OS Platform and Distribution: openSUSE Leap 42.3:
TensorFlow installed from: binary:
TensorFlow version: tensorflow_gpu-1.4.0:
Python version: 2.7.13:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0:
GPU model and memory: 11GB:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
In Caffe, Scale layer could do this:
top = alphaâˆ—bottom+beta
where bottom is the input, top is the output, alpha and beta are the learnable params.
In Tensorflow, what operate could implement above layer?
Thanks, Help a lot.
