Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Issue

Hi guys,
I am working on a structure with recurrent neural network as the deep part of deep reinforcement learning.
I have been searching all along but I haven't found a way to build this structure by using tensorflow. The recurrent feature makes the objective function iterative. I am wondering if TF can calculate the gradient by itself.
It would be great if I can get to know if this structure can be done or not.
