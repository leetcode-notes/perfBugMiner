cmake vs bazel

Hello I am writing with regard compiling tensorflow on linux clusters.
As far as I understood bazel recompiles everything it needs. On out cluster we use spack (https://github.com/LLNL/spack) to compile new software and provide modules to the users. With spack it's easy to track dependencies and provenance of a given installation.
By recompiling everything bazel's need the dependencies are messed up and we don't understand how tensorflow has been compiled from a spack point of view.
Why is it stated" N.B. We provide Linux build instructions primarily for the purpose of testing the build. We recommend using the standard Bazel-based build on Linux."?
Actually, how can we tell to bazel to use system-provided libraries like boost?
Thanks very much,
Nicola
