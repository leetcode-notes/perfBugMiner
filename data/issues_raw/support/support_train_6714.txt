TFSlim: evaluate multiple validation batches using `evaluation_loop`

I'm trying to use placeholders for training with TF-Slim, as my training + evaluation data comes from outside of TF World. I've now got training working by using the workaround described in #6604 and keeping track of the last training batch to supply in the feed dict when calling sess.run(summary_op).
However, evaluation using evaluation_loop over multiple batches seems to not be possible. There are summary_op_feed_dict and eval_op_feed_dict arguments to the evaluation_loop function, but if I understand correctly, if I set num_evals > 1, then the same feed dict (+ data) will be used for every evaluation.
I'm happy add this functionality and issue a PR â€“ is it true that right now the ability to evaluate over multiple validation batches using placeholders is not implemented? I'm using TF 12.1.
