[feature request] GPU Kernel for SparseSegmentMean/SparseSegmentMeanGrad

I'm using embedding_lookup_sparse op (with 'mean' combiner) to do dictionary learning -- sparse lookup is needed because each object is associated with variable length of word list. But it seems there is no gpu kernel implemented for SparseSegmentMean/SparseSegmentMeanGrad. This operation bottlenecks the entire speed.
Wondering if there are plans to implement gpu kernel for these two ops? I believe they are of general interests to people working on NLP, attributes learning as well.
Thanks!
