DSP process time investigation

Hello,
I am evaluating the DSP process time by the bellows source code.
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/hexagon/hexagon_graph_execution_test.cc
And, The result was short process time.
As one factor, I think that the reason is quantization to input data of  DSP.
Could you please tell me a change procedure for quantization ?
And, Could I please have the pb file(NOT quantizate) before the bellows quantization pb file ?
tensorflow_inception_v3_stripped_optimized_quantized.pb
I want to compare between DSP process time(quantizate input data) and CPU process time(NOT quantizate input data)
