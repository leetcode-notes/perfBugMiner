CUDA 9.1 and TensorFlow

I am using NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 and installed NVIDIA 387.26. I installed cuDNN 7.0.5 and CUDA 9.1. As of my understanding, I know that, tensorflow is not supported in CUDA 9.1. My question is when I can expect the next build/release of TF to support CUDA 9.1. For the time being, shall I make a link from CUDA 9.0 to CUDA 9.1 and expect to work? Or is there any better way to solve the problem?
