how to aggregate gradients by weight

tf.gradients has a parameteraggregation_method. As default, it will sum up all the gradients. What should I do if I want to sum up all the gradients by weight? To be more specific, I want to apply a weight to each gradient, then sum them up. This weight may also comes from a tensorflow variable. I asked a question about this in stackoverflow and attached a minimal code snippet.
