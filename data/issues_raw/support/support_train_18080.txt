How to combine two frozen models (Tensorflow) for object detection?

I am trying to combine two frozen models (protobuffs) for object detection. The issue is one of the models is my own dataset and the other is the prebuilt model for coco dataset (just include more classes to the dataset itself). Is this possible? or is there a better approach to perform this?
