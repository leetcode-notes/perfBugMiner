control_dependencies possibly broken

Hi all, I've been playing with control_dependencies in the latest stable version, and I get different results to version 1.0.1. The code below is adapted from the TF Adam optimiser, which might be affected as well.
The code I ran is
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

graph = tf.Graph()

with graph.as_default():
    x = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32, name='x')    
    y = tf.Variable(10., dtype=tf.float32, name='y')
    update_x = tf.assign(x, y)
    with tf.control_dependencies([update_x]):
        update_y = tf.assign(y, x * y)
    update_op = tf.group(update_x, update_y)
    init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
print tf.__version__

res = []
for _ in range(10):
    if 'sess' in locals():
        locals()['sess'].close()
    if 'sess' in globals():
        globals()['sess'].close()

    sess = tf.Session(graph=graph)
    sess.run(init_op)
    res += [sess.run([update_op, x, y])]
print np.mean([r[-1] for r in res])
print np.mean([r[-2] for r in res])

And get results
1.0.1
100.0
10.0

vs
1.2.0
28.0
5.5

suggesting that the control dependencies are not used as expected in version 1.2.0.
Can anyone spot any mistakes in the way I use the control dependencies?
Cheers,
Yarin
