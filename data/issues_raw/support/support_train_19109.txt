IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/tmp/speech_dataset/'

I'm following the speech recognition tutorial from TensorFlow, and when I'm running the following command, which downloads the dataset provided by TensorFlow, it runs perfectly.
python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py
However, when I'm changing the defaults, so that it points to my dataset, it throws the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/tmp/speech_dataset/' 

The command I'm running is:
`python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/train.py --data_url=path/to/data/ --sample_rate=20000 --wanted_words=one,two,three,four,five,six,seven,eight,nine`

Now, the error says that '/tmp/speech_dataset/' is a directory, but it is expecting a file, I guess. When I looked at train.py file, found the following code:
parser.add_argument(
      '--data_dir',
      type=str,
      default='/tmp/speech_dataset/',
      help="""\
      Where to download the speech training data to.
      """)

The --data-dirargument defines where the files from the downloaded dataset should be stored. However, I'm not changing that argument at all, nor does the code need to save any data, since I already have the data on my computer, where I define them at --data-url argument. It seems to me that this is a bug in the code.
Does anyone has experience with speech recognition on TensorFlow and know where the problem might be?
