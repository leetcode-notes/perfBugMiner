Strange bug with tf.nn.nce_loss

So for tf.nn.nce_loss for word2vec_basic, if I explicitly use keyword arguments, such as:
tf.nn.nce_loss(weights=nce_weights,
biases=nce_biases,
labels=train_labels,
inputs=embed,
num_sampled=num_sampled,
num_classes=vocabulary_size))
everything is fine. But if I get rid of the keywords:
tf.nn.nce_loss(nce_weights, nce_biases, train_labels, embed, num_sampled, vocabulary_size))
I run into the bug:
File ".../tensorflow/python/ops/nn.py", line 1336, in nce_loss name=name) File ".../tensorflow/python/ops/nn.py", line 1198, in _compute_sampled_logits array_ops.reshape(true_w, new_true_w_shape)) File ".../tensorflow/python/ops/gen_math_ops.py", line 1613, in mul result = _op_def_lib.apply_op("Mul", x=x, y=y, name=name) File ".../tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py", line 521, in apply_op inferred_from[input_arg.type_attr])) TypeError: Input 'y' of 'Mul' Op has type float32 that does not match type int32 of argument 'x'.
I looked into the source code for nce_loss but couldn't seem to find the cause of this bug. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks a lot!
