Build problem :Configurable attribute "copts" doesn't match this configuration

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux pine64 3.10.104-2-pine64-longsleep aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.3.0-rc0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: no
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build -c opt --copt="-funsafe-math-optimizations" --copt="-ftree-vectorize" --copt="-fomit-frame-pointer" --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
As  tensorflow supports ARM 64-bit CPU platform,so I build it on PINE64.But after I install bazel exactly, and try to install tensorflow,there is something wrong in building process.
Source code / logs

ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted.

As the logs errors indicate the file, so I looks the code ,and it indicates the cpp library configure as follow:
# The library compiled in C++11, rather than C.
397 cc_library(
398     name = "nsync_cpp",
399     srcs = NSYNC_SRC_GENERIC + NSYNC_SRC_PLATFORM_CPP,
400     hdrs = NSYNC_HDR_GENERIC,
401     copts = NSYNC_OPTS_CPP,
402     includes = ["public"],
403     textual_hdrs = NSYNC_INTERNAL_HEADERS + NSYNC_INTERNAL_HEADERS_PLATFORM,
404 )

I try to annotation the number 401 code,the errer above seems disapperence but other errer happens.
I appreciate ever help, thank you all very much.
