regarding the ValueError: inputs must be a list of at least one Tensor with the same dtype and shape

There is a program that defines the loss function as follows:
reg_loss_col = tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES
weight_loss = tf.add_n(tf.get_collection(reg_loss_col),name='reg_loss')


Running the program raises the following error message

File "/home/ decoder/kitti_multiloss.py", line 86, in loss
name='reg_loss')
File "/devl /tensorflow/tf_0.12/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py", line 1827, in add_n
raise ValueError("inputs must be a list of at least one Tensor with the "
ValueError: inputs must be a list of at least one Tensor with the same dtype and shape

I am curious how to print out the tensor information of the first parameter tf.get_collection(reg_loss_col) in tf.add_n, so that I can figure out why this cause the error.
