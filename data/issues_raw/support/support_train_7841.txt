TensorFlow's introductory examples errors

I am following along from this point: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started#basic_usage
It is a linear regression example.
I have approached this execution from two angles:
Angle 1: Running python and copying one line at a time.
When run this line:  estimator = tf.contrib.learn.LinearRegressor(feature_columns=features)
I get this issue: WARNING:tensorflow:Using temporary folder as model directory: C:\Users\elavi\AppData\Local\Temp\tmprirdvmnn INFO:tensorflow:Using default config. INFO:tensorflow:Using config: {'_tf_config': gpu_options { per_process_gpu_memory_fraction: 1 } , '_task_type': None, '_save_checkpoints_steps': None, '_master': '', '_is_chief': True, '_cluster_spec': <tensorflow.python.training.server_lib.ClusterSpec object at 0x0000021D2049C390>, '_task_id': 0, '_save_checkpoints_secs': 600, '_save_summary_steps': 100, '_keep_checkpoint_max': 5, '_keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours': 10000, '_evaluation_master': '', '_tf_random_seed': None, '_environment': 'local', '_num_ps_replicas': 0}
Angle 2: It may be more helpful to see how I run it as a script as a whole. The output is:

I am interested in what is going on but I really need things simplified. A list of steps to fix this would be great. Also, if there are any better ways I could pose my problems in the future, please let me know.
What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
Many. The issue is that I am very new. My ability to understand solutions is very small. I am not well versed with the required terminology. So I have seen this problem posed and closed but I just can't follow along.
Environment info
Operating System: Windows 10
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: I have the latest version but I probably shouldn't because I do not have a dedicated graphics card. (I am doing initial development on Microsoft Surface Pro 4)
