Support unknown dimension in tf.SparseTensor

In doing development calling API (tf.SparseTensor on release 1.1), I got the following error. It appears to be caused by unknown dimension "batch" which is present in n_indices, n_val, obj_ref.get_shape().
Additionally, I wonder if we could have a list of APIs not supporting unknown dimension ....
