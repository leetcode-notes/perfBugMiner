Not able to install tensflow on Windows 7

Hi,
I am not able to tensor flow on Windows7 machine. I searched it and found it seems to b a proxy server problem which is trying to connect to pypi.python.org. I configured it also & tried to install tensorflow, it's still not working. Can anyone tell me how can I install it without compromising the security?
Thanks,
Yugank Narula
