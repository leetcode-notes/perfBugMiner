Is there any way to add classes in inception?

Hi there,
I'm working on retrain example; I have TensorFlow built from source on Ubuntu 14.04, and the examples on flowers work great. However, the process strips away the Inception's final layer and removes all 1,000 existing categories, which means it can now identify 5 species of flowers, but can no longer identify pandas, for example. https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html
How can I add the 5 flower categories to the existing 1,000 categories from ImageNet (and add training for those 5 new flower categories) so that I have 1,005 categories that a test image can be classified as? In other words, be able to identify both those pandas and sunflowers?
Thanks
