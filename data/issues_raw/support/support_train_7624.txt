tensorflow codes totally different result with PyTorch's

Hi, I'm new to tensorflow and trying to refactor one of my project originally in (Py)Torch. However, though the two codes has the same network, the same loss function, the same optimizer parameters, the result is totally different. Is any one have any idea about such issue?
Thanks.
