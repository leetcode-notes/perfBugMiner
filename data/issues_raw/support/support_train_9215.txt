encoder_inputs and decoder_inputs of a sequence to sequence model.

Hello,
I've read the tutorial about seq2seq on the website and still can't figure out how my inputs have to be;
here's my problem:
each of my inputs is a matrix with fixed number of columns but a variable number of rows( each matrix has its number of rows). And the same thing for my outputs.
how to build the encoder and decoder inputs?
Thanks in advance.
