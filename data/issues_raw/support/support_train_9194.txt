XLA: Help understanding compute path for HLO graph

@aidan-plenert-macdonald and I are trying to figure out how the HLO graph is being passed around during xla computations. I'm moving computations over to a new device and am attempting to intercept the graph to see how it's represented, in order to replicate the structure.
A list of the files where I added print statements is included below. Almost none of them print (only Registrar initialization in hlo_graph_dumper.cc, the Transfer functions in client.cc and service.cc, and the CpuCompiler and XpuCompiler initializations), and I've added statements in almost every function in the attached files.
Where is the HLO graph being assembled and dumped? How do I access the HLO graph?
Note: the 'xpu' folder/files are for my new device - they're replicas of the 'cpu' folder/files in compiler/xla/service, with all mentions of 'cpu' changed to 'xpu'. List of files with print statements:
