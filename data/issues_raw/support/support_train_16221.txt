Meaning of report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom output

Python: 3.6.2
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Tensorflow: 1.5.0rc1
When running a session with tf.RunOptions and report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom=True I get the following output at the end of my log.

I am wondering why some entries occur multiple times? How can a single node have multiple allocations? Why are they not summed?
Does Remaining 1252 nodes with 98.80MiB mean that all 1252 nodes together use 98.80MiB or each single one uses that amount?
When summing up all values I get 10.607822265625GiB but my free GPU space when starting my program is 11.92GiB so shouldn't there still be enough space??
