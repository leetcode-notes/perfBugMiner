Hi, I have the error below when i execute the line ""lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(config.n_hidden, forget_bias=1.0)""
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.ops.nn' has no attribute 'rnn_cell'
I was installed Tensorflow on windows using "Installing with Anaconda"
Any one have the same error and solve it Please!
