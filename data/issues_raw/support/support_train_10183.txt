tf.nn.dynamic_rnn seems not working when given sequence_length

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0rc0
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA: 8.0 cuDNN: 5.1
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080 8GB

Describe the problem
I tried to migrate my code from tensorflow r1.1.0 to tensorflow r1.2.0rc0.
When using tf.nn.dynamic_rnn, if sequence_length is not None, It got an error(traceback pasted below).
However, if I set sequence_length to None, it works properly as before.
Is this a bug or I got something wrong?
Source code / logs
Source code:
tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
    cell,
    inputs,
    dtype=tf.float32,
    sequence_length=lens)
where lens is a Tensor:
Tensor("Gather_DequeueMany:0", shape=(256,), dtype=int32)
