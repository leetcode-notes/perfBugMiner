Eager API symbols not exported in the CI libtensorflow.so

The eager API symbols (i.e., TFE_*) do not seem to be exported in the libtensorflow.so built by the CI system. I tried the nightly builds and they're missing from them. I checked using nm -D libtensorflow.so as well as readelf -Ws libtensorflow.so and objdump -TC libtensorflow.so. I'm not sure where to look to fix this though as the Mac nightly build seems fine. @asimshankar @alextp
