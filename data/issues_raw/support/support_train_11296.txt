No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'LesseEqual' with these attrs on Android

On Android I am trying to load a tensorflow graph which I have frozen by using convert_variables_to_constants however I am getting:
com.example.trio.tensordemo E/TensorflowDebug:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'LessEqual' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU],
Registered kernels:

[[Node: bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/LessEqual = LessEqual[T=DT_INT32, _device="/device:GPU:0"](bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/Max, bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/LessEqual/y)]]
This is what the node looks like:
name: "bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/LessEqual_1"
op: "LessEqual"
input: "bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/Max"
input: "bidirectional_rnn/fw/fw/LessEqual_1/y"
device: "/device:CPU:0"
attr {
key: "T"
value {
type: DT_INT32
}
}
The tensorflow version I trained and loaded in Android are both r1.2.
