Tensorflow freezes during execution of session.run()

We currently experience an issue with an implementation. During the execution of session.run, the process suddenly freezes. It does not crash but is irresponsive to ctrl+c. It isn't consuming any CPU anymore (and is not progressing either). This occurs on CPU, we haven't tested GPU. The issue seems to be highly related to #2788.
We ran the script on a machine running an up-to-date Ubuntu 16.04 with 128gb of ram, and 2 x Xeon CPU E5-2640 v4 processors. The issue occured with tensorflow 0.12.1 installed through anaconda. Then we reproduced the issue using a build of the master branch, without any CUDA support, using the system libraries rather than those shipped with anaconda.
The build of the master branch shows:
print(tensorflow.version)
1.0.0-rc2
$ git rev-parse HEAD

Attached is the output of running  thread apply all bt 10 in gdb. All threads appear to be waiting.
We are running a model locally implemented using GPflow (not one of the default models of that library though), unfortunately this occurs on a confidential data set. If required we can look into providing a MWE but I can not guarantee we can reproduce this easily under different circumstances.
