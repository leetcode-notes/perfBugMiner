Principle of setting 'hash_bucket_size' parameter ?

Question 1:
In wide_n_deep_tutorial.py, there is a hyper-parameter named hash_bucket_size for both tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket and tf.feature_column.crossed_column methods,  and the value is hash_bucket_size=1000.
But why 1000? How to set this parameter ?
Question 2:
The second question about crossed_columns, that is,
crossed_columns = [ tf.feature_column.crossed_column( ["education", "occupation"], hash_bucket_size=1000), tf.feature_column.crossed_column( [age_buckets, "education", "occupation"], hash_bucket_size=1000), tf.feature_column.crossed_column( ["native_country", "occupation"], hash_bucket_size=1000) ] in wide_n_deep_tutorial.py,
Why choose ["education", "occupation"], [age_buckets, "education", "occupation"] and ["native_country", "occupation"] as crossed_columns , are there any rule of thumb ?
