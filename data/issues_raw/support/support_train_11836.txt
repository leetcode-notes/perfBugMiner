'module' object has no attribute 'BasicLSTMCell'

Hello guys,
I'm adopting a project of version 1.1.0 to version 1.2.1. Looks like some APIs have changed. I'm new to tensorflow, could someone tell what's the new APIs for those old ones below:
from tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops import core_rnn_cell_impl as rnn_cell
core_rnn_cell_impl doesn't exist, but I need BasicLSTMCell is in rnn_cell.
Thank you very much.
Eric
