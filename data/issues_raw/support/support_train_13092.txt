Errror in creatinig training and inference logits

I am using ubuntu 16.04
version of tensorflow is 1.3.0
installed and validated using anaconda
While trying to create training and inference logits of input[32] of the following python notebook
https://github.com/Currie32/Chatbot-from-Movie-Dialogue/blob/master/Chatbot_Attention.ipynb
I was getting errors while executing the following command:
train_logits, inference_logits = seq2seq_model( tf.reverse(input_data, [-1]), targets, keep_prob, batch_size, sequence_length, len(answers_vocab_to_int), len(questions_vocab_to_int), encoding_embedding_size, decoding_embedding_size, rnn_size, num_layers, questions_vocab_to_int)
Stack trace:
