TypeError: zeros_initializer() takes at least 1 argument

Tensorflow 0.12.1 (4d924e7)
I cloned the up-to-dated tensorflow-models today.
I got the following error msg:
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: zeros_initializer() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)
I read through previous issues on zeors_initializer() & ones_initializer(). And I replaced zeros_initializer() w/ constant_initializer(0.0), but got the new error:

Anybody can help? Thanks a lot!
