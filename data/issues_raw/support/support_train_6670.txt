How to read Android Demo Detection Model Priors.pb file ?

Hello !
I would like to look into the assets file : multibox_location_priors.pb which contains boxpriors locations.
I want to use them in a iPythonNotebook to test the model with offline images but I don't know how to access properly to the values for all locations.
Is there any easy way to parse the file and get the locations values like it is possible to do with graph.pb file using these lines
with tf.gfile.FastGFile("graph.pb", 'rb') as f:
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

Thanks in advance for your help
