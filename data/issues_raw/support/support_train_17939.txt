Fail to convert TransposeConv into tflite

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below): latest
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): Build label: 0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
GPU model and memory:N/A
Exact command to reproduceN/A:

I try to convert my model into tflite, shows the below error:
F tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/graph_transformations/propagate_fixed_sizes.cc:243] Check failed: weights_shape.dims(0) == 1 && weights_shape.dims(3) == 1 TransposeConv weights dimensions must begin and end with 1. Input weights "Variable_39/read_transposed" had shape [ 128, 3, 3, 64 ].
Does the TFLite TransposeConv weights only support [1, X, X, 1]  ?
And I checked the commit ID: 58fe7d2 : "Support for transpose convolution. Includes striding, and a reference implementation."
Seems that transpose convolution is not suppoertted yet, I can not find any Register_XXX in the ops files, only a function "inline void TransposeConv(const float* input_data, const Dims<4>& input_dims,
const float* filter_data, const Dims<4>& filter_dims,
int stride_width, int stride_height, int pad_width,
int pad_height, float* output_data,
const Dims<4>& output_dims)"
and there is no place call this function "TransposeConv"
