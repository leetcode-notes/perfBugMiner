MatchPath Implementation

Hi,
I can't seem to find the implementation of the "MatchPath" function. I understand this depends on the environment being used, but is there a default implementation somewhere? I want to find out the details of how the path patterns are treated in TensorFlow so I can write a converter from a TF pattern to a regex and use it within another language that has no access to the TF file IO library.
Thanks,
Anthony
