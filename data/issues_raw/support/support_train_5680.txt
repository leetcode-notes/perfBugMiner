Anyway to clear/reset the static shape to None?

Tensor.set_shape() doesn't set shape but merge shape. If I don't want the statically-inferred shape, could there be a method to clear it?
The use case is as following: I have:
x = tf.random_uniform([128,10])
# other operations involving x
in the graph, but I want to be able to run it (in inference time) with feed_dict={x: value} where value is a tensor of shape [1, 10]. It would work perfectly if I could somehow set the shape of x to [None, 10].
Currently I'm using tf.shape() as argument of random_uniform to avoid shape inference and set_shape later, which is not a very nice solution.
