double free or corruption (!prev) and tensorboard show nothing

I'm new to use tensorflow.
And I want to  learn how to use tensorboard.
So I run the demo code mnist_with_summaries.py,
But in the end it shows
*** Error in `/home/wxy/anaconda2/envs/tensorflow/bin/python': double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0000000002166320 ***
And I input tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/mnist/logs and open  http://0.0.0.0:6006/ it shows nothing.
so I follow the guide to input
/tmp/mnist/logs | grep tfevents
then
/tmp/mnist/logs/test/events.out.tfevents.1487915616.wxy
/tmp/mnist/logs/train/events.out.tfevents.1487915615.wxy
input
tensorboard --inspect --logdir=/tmp/mnist/logs
then
Processing event files... (this can take a few minutes)
Found event files in:
/tmp/mnist/logs/test
/tmp/mnist/logs/train
These tags are in /tmp/mnist/logs/test:

So I want some people to help me.
Thank you so much!
