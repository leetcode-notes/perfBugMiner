Using Boolean Placeholder for is_training Causes Problems when Loading on iOS

Currently I am training a model that uses Batch Normalization and Dropout. Because of this I build the model to take a placeholder, is_training, that I can feed_dict true or false depending on whether the graph is being used for training or validation.
I take the trained model and export using tensorflow.contrib.session_bundle.exporter however when I try to load this graph on iOS, I run into problems (see SO):
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Switch' with these attrs.

I have tried removing the placeholder and injecting the actual value of False for is_training (see SO and GH), however the model still does not load (see SO post):
Input 0 of node dropout6/cond/dropout/random_uniform/max was passed bool from dropout6/cond/Switch:1 incompatible with expected INVALID.

It seems like something is missing to clean up / recompile the graph, stripping out the training part of the graph because the inject does not seem like enough. This was one idea to solve the problem: #5919.
Right now, I can instead of using placeholder for is_training use constants and create the model twice, sharing weights, and then export just the validation subgraph and then load this into iOS, but the downside is that I need to instantiate the model twice into the graph.
EDIT: Would be nice to not have to resort to compiling iOS with switch: #2680 (comment) since that node shouldn't even be needed in the final graph. It would be nice to fully remove it from the saved graph.
