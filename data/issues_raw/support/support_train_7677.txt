"Getting started" first tf.contrib.learn sample fails

The first tf.contrib.learn sample at
https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started
fails to run.
The  code is right under
"Basic usage
Notice how much simpler the linear regression program becomes with tf.contrib.learn:"
Output:
WARNING:tensorflow:Using temporary folder as model directory: C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpahtnt89p
WARNING:tensorflow:Rank of input Tensor (1) should be the same as output_rank (2) for column. Will attempt to expand dims. It is highly recommended that you resize your input, as this behavior may change.
WARNING:tensorflow:From C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\contrib\learn\python\learn\estimators\head.py:521: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.
