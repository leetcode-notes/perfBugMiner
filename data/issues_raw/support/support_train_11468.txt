Fine tuning tutorial without Bazel

I am using this tutorial provided by Google Research to fine tune the Inception model fro my own images.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/README.md#how-to-fine-tune-a-pre-trained-model-on-a-new-task
I have access to a GPU provided by my institution. The problem is that the GPU doesn't have Bazel installed.
Is it possible to complete this tutorial without using Bazel?
