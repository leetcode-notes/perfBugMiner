C++ tensorflow interface is taking too long to terminate and return the calculated graph output.

Hi All,
I am loading a trained graph (from python) in c++ as explained in the below links,

I am using this tf feature in larger c++ application, the working is as follows, main function creates a process that will load the graph, calculate and return the output.  This process will be called every  ~0.1 seconds.  The interface works fine, however it takes rather long (~1 second) to terminate and return the value to main.  I have also timed duration from loading the graph until return, within the tf api, it takes ~0.015 seconds.
I am unable to figure out the reason for this delay, I am not sure if it is due to c++ createprocess or tf sesion handling, can someone help me to address this issue.
I have also posted the same question in  stackoverflow, which got down voted a lot, as I am unable to solve this problem I am posting it here too, sorry if it is not the correct platform.
I am using python 3.5 (Anaconda 4.2.0) on a Windows 7 system.
tensorflow CPU version 1.2.0
bazel 0.5.3
VS 2015
