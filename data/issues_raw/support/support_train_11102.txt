using output_layer in seq2seq model?

Osï¼šliunx
version: v1.2.0
i am writing a seq2seq model using tensorflow. my problem is
helper = TrainingHelper(...)
decoder = BasicDecoder(...)
decoder_outputs, final_state, seq_len  = tf.contrib.seq2seq.dynamic_decode(decoder)
rnn_out, sample_ids = decoder_outputs
in traing period, we should calculate the loss:
loss = tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss(rnn_out, targets, weights)
the rnn_out's shape should be (batch_size, seq_len, target_vocab_size), but (batch_size, seq_len, cell_hidden_size)
how to change the shape ? should i add a output_layer in decoder ?
if add, how to define a output_layer? i found tf.layers.dense has two params (inputs, units), units may be target_vocab_size, but what about inputs?
In addition, is the output_layer is same as the beamSearcheDecoder when decoding?
