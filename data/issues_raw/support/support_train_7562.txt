Standalone Tensorflow Projector

Sorry to double open this issue but did not get any answer from StackExchange forum :

Tensorflow Projector is a great way to visualize a mutli dimensional dataset and I was wondering if you are planning to open source the version running on the web (ie outside tensorboard), so we would be able to visualize any dataset from a simple TSV file (and not only word embedding or other learnt representation from TF)
Thanks
