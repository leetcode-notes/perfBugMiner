Where is gen_logging_ops source code?

Hi,
I have a question about this import from tensorflow/tensorflow/python/summary/summary.py line 53:
from tensorflow.python.ops import gen_logging_ops as _gen_logging_ops
When I go to the directory  tensorflow/python/ops, there is no such file called gen_logging_ops.
I am wondering how this worked out? BTW, I am tracking the r1.3 version.
Any suggestion is highly appreciated!
Best wishes,
Binhang
