Unsupported CPU features cause runtime errors.

I'm having runtime errors when running Tensorflow programs. I tracked down the problem and the source seems to be that the shared object I have compiled includes CPU features that are not supported by my processor. That causes some pointers pointing to invalid addresses. Right now there are 37 CPU feature defined in tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_info.h. My question is how to not include some of those when compiling Tensorflow's source code.
