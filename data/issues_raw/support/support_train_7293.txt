How to do k-max pooling with proper dim ?

Hi folks,
Does anybody have this same issue as me ? I want to apply a k-max pooling to this var, however it's is not in the proper dimension yet:
For ex:
h = tf.Variable(batch_size,1,18,512)     # This is the obligatory dim's result I got when I apply Deep CNN in NLP
I want to have the result of k-max pooling like this:
h_kmaxpooling with dim (batch_size,1,8,512)
If I use tf.nn.top_k(h, 8), it will result in (batch_size,1,18,8) instead.
I've tried tf.transpose(x, perm=[batch_size, 1, 512, 18]) but it always give error in batch_size since it doesn't know how many examples are. Or may be I've set wrong tf.transpose in this case ?
