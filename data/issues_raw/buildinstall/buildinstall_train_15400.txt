setuptools error on upgrading to 1.4.1

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS Sierra
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6 (normal install, NO virtualenv, NO anaconda, ...)
Exact command to reproduce: sudo pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

When upgrading TF 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 using the command above, I get the error message:
Could not import setuptools which is required to install from a source distribution.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip/req/req_install.py", line 387, in setup_py
    import setuptools  # noqa
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/setuptools/__init__.py", line 10, in <module>

    from pkg_resources.extern import VendorImporter
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources.extern'

I have been able to solve the problem with the following command:
pip3 install -U setuptools

After this, running pip3 install --upgrade Tensorflow runs successfully.
