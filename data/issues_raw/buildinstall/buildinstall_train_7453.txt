error while building on windows with cuda 7.5

I have spent days to build tensorflow on windows with cuda 7.5 but met a lot of error. I first followed https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/readme.md. I modified CmakeList.txt from cuda 8 to cuda 7.5. But nvcc version 7.5 do not support visual studio 2015. When I change to visual studio 2013. It failed with constexpr because visual studio 2013 do not support it. When I remove constexpr it got a lot of error of noexcept, uint16 and so on. So is it possible to build tensorflow with cuda 7.5? In a lot of cases, it's not possible to use cuda 8 . So can it be seen as a feature request to support cuda 7.5 on windows? Thanks.
