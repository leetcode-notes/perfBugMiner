Official GPU support for macOS (Considering launch of official eGPU support on macOS)

Hi there, with the launch of version 10.13.4, now the macOS officially support eGPU(extend GPU). Though there does not have a official Nvidia GPU driver, users still can drive their Nvidia eGPU with the Nvidia Web Driver. So the use of CUDA and cuDNN on macOS become possible.
For now, without the official GPU-support binary package, eGPU users like me have to compile from source code, which is a really nasty work. I am appreciated if there could have an official GPU-support binary package for macOS users again.
Considering the reality, the feature I mentioned above may hard to implement.  But I think a more friendly compile process would be helpful. I tried six times to compile the r1.7 branch last night and all failed.
Anyway, thanks for your effort and contribution :)
