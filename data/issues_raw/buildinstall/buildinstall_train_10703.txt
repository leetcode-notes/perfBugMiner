Bazel bring up for ROCm

Hi,
I am trying to add new backend to tensorflow. As a first step, I started changing bazel files around (Commit here). When I enable XLA + ROCM during configure, and run bazel build -s --config=opt --config=rocm //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package, I am getting the following error:
ERROR: no such package '@local_config_rocm//': error loading package 'external': The repository named 'local_config_rocm' could not be resolved.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.227s

It would be great if someone can parse the commit mentioned and suggest changes.
Thank you!
