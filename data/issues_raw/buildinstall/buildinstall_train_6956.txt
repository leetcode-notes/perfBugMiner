Error downloading nasm

As noted in issue #6950 nasm-2.12.02.tar.bz2 is currently unavailable. (www.nasm.us does not accept connections.) @trsaunders observed this for head of r0.12 and I can confirm this for v0.12.0.
Workaround: Google the file to get it from another source and update URL in tensorflow/workspace.bzl (if you download a .gz file re-compress to bz2 and put it on a webserver) - sha256 fingerprinting should check that the file contents are correct; if you don't trust ./configure to check this, check the sha256sum yourself against the sha256 given in the .bzl file.
