third_party/zlib: use -DZ_HAVE_UNISTD_H instead of suppressing warnings

Hi,
I noticed that you built zlib by suppressing warnings about it using undeclared functions. However, I discovered that adding copts = ["-DZ_HAVE_UNISTD_H"] could make zlib to include unistd.h and therefore get rid of the warnings completely.
While this change is very minor, I think declaring the macro is better than suppressing the warnings.
