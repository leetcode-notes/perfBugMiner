Building from source on macOS: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'

I found two other issues mention this error, though none of the proposed solutions fixed the problem for me.
Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: None
On a fresh install of Sierra, I've used brew to install bazel, python, python3 (which gives me 3.6.0), pyenv, and the virtualenv plugin for pyenv. I'm following the "Build from source" instructions for Mac, created a virtual environment specifically for building tensorflow, and when running ./configure using all the defaults and answering N to all the questions. At the final step, building the wheel, I get:
(build-tensorflow) ‚ùØ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'

I thought this was maybe a pip or setuptools version issue, but they all seem on the latest version. pip list outputs:
appdirs (1.4.3)
numpy (1.12.0)
packaging (16.8)
pip (9.0.1)
pyparsing (2.2.0)
setuptools (34.3.2)
six (1.10.0)
wheel (0.29.0)

Any help to understand how to resolve the bdist_wheel error will be much appreciated, thanks!
