Error when  using the TensorFlow Runtime with HVX Acceleration

OS: Ubuntu 14.04 64bits
Android Version: 6.0.1
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
I follow the description in tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/hvx,  after compiling the so files and the hexagon_graph_execution,  what's more, I also have pushed  additional network define file(tensorflow_inception_v3_stripped_optimized_quantized.pb) and the test image to my phone.
But when I start to run the binary file in my Snapdragon 820 android devices, it failed all the test cases.
The stdout log is showed below,   How can I resolve this question?
