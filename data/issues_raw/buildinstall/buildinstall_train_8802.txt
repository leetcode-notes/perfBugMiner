Wheels on PyPI violate manylinux1 specification / PEP513

Follow-up issue to #5033.
As already pointed out by @jjhelmus, the Linux wheels on PyPI do not conform to the manylinux1 specification provided in PEP513. To quote @jjhelmus's comment from #5033:

Specifically, they contain shared libraries which reference versioned symbols which do not meet the GLIBC <= 2.5 and GLIBCXX <= 3.4.9 requirements specified in the PEP.

It would be great if the wheels could be fixed to match the specification.
