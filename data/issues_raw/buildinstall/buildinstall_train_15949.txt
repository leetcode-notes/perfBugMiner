Building TensorFlow on Windows: patch and rm

System information

Have I written custom code: Yes, provided below.
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10 1709, Build 16299.192
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary, Attempting source build of master
TensorFlow version: 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version:  0.9.0
GCC/Compiler version:  MSYS2 Shell, GCC unknown.
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A, CPU is i7-8550U, 8 GB memory
Exact command to reproduce: Any bazel build on Windows. Please see Description.

Describe the problem
Building TensorFlow on Windows has been a struggle with compatibility due to the fact that for many, MSYS will not run patch when installed from the MSYS2 shell. I have found a reliable way to resolve the issue: using Choco to install patch, moving patch.exe to a folder FOLDERNAME within its default directory, and then running %FOLDERNAME%/patch.exe with the flag --binary (to use CR LF line breaks) with a custom batch script compiled into a executable.
bazel build now completes patch commands without issue. But as it often is, another hurdle exists to the finish line. Bazel now attempts to recursively force remove a file using rm -rf, which obviously does not exist as a package in Choco as a bash command. MSYS will run it, but not from the command line.
Is there any way to get around the use of rm, or make a compatible solution for Windows using del?
I have ensured that #15829 has been installed. Still fails
If this is better left to the Bazel developers, please close this issue.
