ImportError: libcublas.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I'm trying to run Tensorflow-gpu through virtualenv via pip3 in Ubuntu 16.04. I have installed Cuda-9.0 and cuDNN v7.0.3, then tested both and they are working fine. However, when attempting to import Tensorflow in Python I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py", line 58, in

File "/usr/lib/python3.5/imp.py", line 342, in load_dynamic
return _load(spec)
ImportError: libcublas.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I located libcublas.so in /usr/local/cuda/lib64. However, I see that it references a new version of the library (9.0.176), My question is whether something simple can be done (like creating a symbolic link to the library with the name of libcublas.so.8.0) or I have to wait for an update in TF that can run with Cuda9/cuDNN 7
Cheers!
