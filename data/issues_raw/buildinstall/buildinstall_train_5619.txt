Issue installing from sources with GPU support (l2loss_op_gpu.cu.pic.o' was not created.)

Problem:
When trying to install from sources using GPU support following the instructions from Tensorflow documentation using bazel command,
bazel build -c opt --config=CUDA --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
I encounter the following error.
./tensorflow/core/kernels/l2loss_op.h(32): here
