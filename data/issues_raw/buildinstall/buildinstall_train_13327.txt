v1.3.0 protobuf and sha256sum does not match

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I am compiling tensorflow_cc.so using bazel, and the head was at v1.3.0, it encountered an ERROR
tensorflow/BUILD:446:1: error loading package 'tensorflow/c': Encountered error while reading extension file 'protobuf.bzl': no such package '@protobuf//': java.io.IOException: Error downloading [https://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz, http://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/google/protobuf/archive/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz] to .cache/bazel/_bazel_xiaochunlin/8e84b434cfbb634410b719fa2fe8ff20/external/protobuf/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz: Checksum was e5fdeee6b28cf6c38d61243adff06628baa434a22b5ebb7432d2a7fbabbdb13d but wanted 6d43b9d223ce09e5d4ce8b0060cb8a7513577a35a64c7e3dad10f0703bf3ad93 and referenced by '//tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so'.
I manually downloaded the protobuf with the given link in tensorflow/workspace.bzl , https://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/0b059a3d8a8f8aa40dde7bea55edca4ec5dfea66.tar.gz , and the sha256sum indeed is e5fdeee6b28cf6c38d61243adff06628baa434a22b5ebb7432d2a7fbabbdb13d. So I guess the sha256sum and the given version protobuf don't match, can anyone verify this ??
