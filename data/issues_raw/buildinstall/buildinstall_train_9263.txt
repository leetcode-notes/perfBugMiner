import tensorflow Segmentation fault

I get 'Segmentation fault' everytime when import tensorflow.
No matter which tf's version, or which numpy's version i try. Or even 'import numpy' at first.
My computer is CentOS6.5 with python 2.7.3.
Current tensorflow's version is 'https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl'.
BTW: it happends after i try to update my glibc. cause i met "version GLIBC_2.14' not found" and "versionGLIBC_2.16' not found" before.
