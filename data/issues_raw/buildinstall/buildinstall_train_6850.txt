cudnn.h header not found on Ubuntu when using NVidia's CUDNN .debs

The official libcudnn5-dev package from NVidia (developers.nvidia.com), version 5.1.5-1+cuda-8.0, places the cudnn.h header at
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/cudnn_v5.h
but Tensorflow's config script looks for it at:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/include/cudnn.h
which means that running Tensorflow's configure script fails.
A workaround is to add a symlink:
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/include
sudo ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/cudnn_v5.h /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/include/cudnn.h

after which Tensorflow's configure script completes successfully.
