Issue with running Tensorflow with OpenCL - Ubuntu 14.04.3 (Trusty) - AMD R5 Radeon M335 GPU

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):14.04.3-->Trusty
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.0 (Steps-> Downloaded tensorflow from https://github.com/benoitsteiner/tensorflow-opencl, ./configure - to configure project)
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version:NA
OPENCL Version:
Number of platforms:	1
Platform Profile:	FULL_PROFILE
Platform Version:	OpenCL 2.0 AMD-APP (1800.11)
Platform Name:	AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
Platform Vendor:	Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
Platform Extensions:	cl_khr_icd cl_amd_event_callback cl_amd_offline_devices
GPU model and memory:
Platform Name:	AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
Number of devices:	2
Device Type:	CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU
Board name:	AMD Radeon (TM) R5 M335
Memory:	4096M
Exact command to reproduce:
run the python script -- ipython keras_code.py
** G++/GCC version**:
g++-4.9 (Ubuntu 4.9.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.1) 4.9.4
I have compiled CPP programs, they work fine.
ComputeCPP: 0.1.4
-- ** Python**: I am using Anaconda distribution Python for 2.7.2. (Anaconda - 2.4.3)
Describe the problem
I have compile tensorflow, and deployed the same -> No issues here. when I try to run the code I run into the following error:
2017-04-23 14:01:15.180795: W ./tensorflow/core/common_runtime/sycl/sycl_util.h:44] No OpenCL GPU found that is supported by ComputeCpp, trying OpenCL CPU
2017-04-23 14:01:15.180843: F ./tensorflow/core/common_runtime/sycl/sycl_util.h:53] No OpenCL GPU nor CPU found that is supported by ComputeCpp
Aborted (core dumped)
I have attached the code file. Please note this is a simplified version of the file. The logic is:
Read data from files,
Pass it through a NN
I am using Keras as the Functional programming API on top of Tensorflow.
