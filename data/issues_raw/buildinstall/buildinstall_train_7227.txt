ld: file not found: -lcudart.8.0 when building CUDA on MacOS and bazel 0.4.4

In today's head b47dc70, and bazel 0.4.4, bazel building with XLA + CUDA on MacOS fails because it can't find cuda library when linking. I was able to build with the same setup from head from Jan 24 .
bazel build --config=cuda --config=opt -k //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
...
ld: file not found: -lcudart.8.0
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.513s, Critical Path: 0.11s


I see libcudart_static.a in my /usr/local/cuda/lib and similar issue suggests that linking needs to be done with -L$CUDA_HOME/lib flag, but I can't figure out how to massage that option into bazel config
I also tried building with flags --action_env PATH --action_env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH --action_env LD_LIBRARY_PATH and copying libcudart_static.a to libcudart.8.0.a
Note that libcudart dependency dependency exists in CPU-only build as well because of #7216
