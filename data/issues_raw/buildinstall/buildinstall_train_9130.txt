r.0.11 avro missing files

Hi
I am trying to install tf r0.11 in a Centos 7 without GPU support from sources. I have a similar problem like the #4312. I followed the recommended actions, yet I get the same error. BESIDES, I get the following (not described in the issue 4312) error:
Error downloading from http://www-us.apache.org/dist/avro/avro-1.8.0/cpp/avro-cpp-1.8.0.tar.gz
I tryed to find this file using the web browser and I coudn't find it. The online repository doesn't have it anymore. Just the avro-1.8.1 and avro-1.7.7 are available.
Thanks
Regards
A
