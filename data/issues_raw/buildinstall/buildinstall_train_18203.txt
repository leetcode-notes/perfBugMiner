As per documentation Tensorflow 1.5 with Cuda -8

Hi,
As per documentation in the below link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/install/install_linux#InstallingVirtualenv
Requirement for tensorflow 1.5 is Cuda 8. I installed tensorflow using the following tf binary url https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0rc1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
However, still it is asking for cuda 9. Is there any .whl, which supports cuda 8 ( tensorflow 1.5).
