The pip upgrade in windows does not get up-to-date tensorflow codes on github

Tensorflow version: 1.3
OS: Windows 10
When I use pip upgrade to get tensorflow, the codes I got did not reflect the newest updates in Github. For example, in "tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py" the up-to-date batch_norm() function supports not None param_regularizers. However, the codes updated by pip still not support param_regularizers, as the codes are not up-to-date.
Is there any other way to get the most updated tensorflow in Windows? Thank you.
