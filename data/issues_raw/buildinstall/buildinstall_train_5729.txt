Feature request: Please release an official binary for Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for robotics and automation. The native camera also makes a great combo for portable / embedded / robotics computer vision. Having TensorFlow available on this platform would really open up a lot of options in this context.

It only provides a binary for TensorFlow 0.10. I've had lots of issues with it running DNNs trained on 0.11. I need to train on 0.11 because the only fast GPU I have is an Nvidia Pascal chip, and 0.10 doesn't work well on Pascal (due to CUDA version issues).
I've tried to compile 0.11 following the guide there, but there were a lot of errors.
