My goal is to build an Android App which loads pre-trained TensorFlow model and runs it on an Android device. I am working on Android Studio on Windows. Unfortunately using Android Studio on Linux is currently not an option.
Following previous advice from this forum, I am trying to build an Android example using Bazel on Windows.
I've successfully installed Bazel using Chocolatey.
Following the build instructions, I changed the SDK and NDK paths in WORKSPACE file and ran:
bazel build //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
So far I did the following to fix errors:

copied aapt.exe to aapt, zipalign.exe to zipalign, since their name is different on Windows/Linux
installed using pacman gcc

But I am stuck again. I am getting the following error which I have no idea how to fix:

Please advice how to proceed?
Isn't there an easier way to achieve what I want? I just need pre-built TensorFlow binaries for Android Studio on Windows, to build an example application.  So far I found only pre-built Python distribution and Bazel installation on Windows
