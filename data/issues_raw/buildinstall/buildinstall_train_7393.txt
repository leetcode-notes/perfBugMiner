Have Docker Build not Install via Pip

In the Development Dockerfile, I see this note,
# TODO(craigcitro): Don't install the pip package, since it makes it
# more difficult to experiment with local changes. Instead, just add
# the built directory to the path.

Due to the lack of important header files in mainstream Tensorflow, I need to patch the TF build so I can get those headers. Unfortunately, the current Dockerfile clears the Bazel cache. I am requesting that the above TODO, be resolved soon, so I can patch Tensorflow's Bazel BUILD files in order to make local changes and build quicker. Rebuilding TF without a cache in the container takes a pretty long time.
