Cannot build TensorFlow on macOS 10.12

When I trying to build TensorFlow with avx, avx2, fma, sse4,1 sse4,2, it shown that
clang: error: no such file or directory: 'msse4.1'
clang: error: no such file or directory: 'msse4.2'

clang doesn't support sse4.1 and sse4.2?
And I can not change the bazel compiler to gcc anyway
