Configure requires user interaction in r0.11

The ./configure in the r0.11 branch requires user interaction if there is more than one PYTHON_LIBRARY_PATH found by the util/python/python_config.sh script. In r0.10 it was possible to run a ./configure without user interaction. Furthermore, in the PR #5135 the script was changed to make it possible to directly specify the PYTHON_LIBRARY_PATH to prevent the need of user interaction.
I think this fix should also be merged into to the r0.11 branch to ensure tensorflow can be configured/build without user interaction (when there are multiple pythons installed).
