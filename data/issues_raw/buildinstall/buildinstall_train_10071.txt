Cannot build jemalloc support using CMake on Linux (fails trying to include <windows.h>)

I am using the provided cmake build project files to compile tensorflow because I have a custom clang binary built with additional optimization passes of my own.
The build works fine without Jemalloc
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../tensorflow/contrib/cmake/  
make -j4   # compiles O.K.

but when I add the jemalloc option it fails.
cmake -Dtensorflow_ENABLE_JEMALLOC_SUPPORT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../tensorflow/contrib/cmake/  
make

Looking at cmake/jemalloc/src/jemalloc/GetPageSize/getpagesize.log there is

By looking at getpagesize.c it is clear it is a windows-only source file that should not have been compiled on Linux.
I went further investigating why jemalloc is trying to compile a windows source under Linux but I got nowhere after an hour or so. I lack understanding of the jemalloc build and I will continue to look into this but if you have someone on your side with a more prompt answer, that would save me time, thank you.
