Android example using CMake on Windows not working

I installed CPU-only Tensorflow version 1.0 on Windows using the pip installer. I am trying to get the Android example to run using CMake as explained in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/cmake. I cloned the newest version of the tensorflow repository and created a new Android studio project and followed the instructions from the webpage above by modifying the gradle files.  I already found out that it should be
debugCompile project(path: ':TensorFlow-Android-Inference', configuration: 'debug') releaseCompile project(path: ':TensorFlow-Android-Inference', configuration: 'release')
instead of
debugCompile project(path: ':tensorflow_inference', configuration: 'debug') releaseCompile project(path: ':tensorflow_inference', configuration: 'release')
Now, however, I get a build error stating "Error:Project :app declares a dependency from configuration 'releaseCompile' to configuration 'release' which is not declared in the descriptor for project :TensorFlow-Android-Inference."
Has anyone tried this or could anyone point me to a proper explanation of how to use cMake to build the project.
Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks.
