how to build iOS static library using bazel

I'm working with tag v0.11.0.rc2.
Following the instructions here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/README.md I have successfully built tensorflow for iOS using the makefile approach.  However, I have wondered about the first line in the readme

The recommended way to build TensorFlow from source is using the Bazel open-source build system

I can't find any targets in the bazel BUILD files that would build libprotobuf-lite.a, libprotobuf.a, and libtensorflow-core.a that the makefile approach builds.
Does anyone know how to build the static libs for iOS using Bazel?  Is there a reason/advantage to do so?
