tf version not working on older linux version

Hi, may I ask if tf is built on ubuntu? The many linux wheel from pip or even anaconda causes errors on systems such as CentOS 6.6. Particularly it is looking for a GLIBC-2.16.so but can't find it. On my system there exists only GLIBC-2.14.so. Does anyone have any solution for this?
