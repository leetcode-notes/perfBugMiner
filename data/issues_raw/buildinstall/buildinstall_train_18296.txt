Building Tensorflow on Windows

At https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources, you say:
"We do not support building TensorFlow on Windows."
Why not? Are there any plans to support this in future? I know it is technically possible to build with CMake, but official support would be nice. At the moment, I am trying to use a trained model for inference as part of a C++ application. I am constrained to Windows, and getting a trained model into the app is much more difficult than it needs to be. Surely there are many people out there also using Windows?
Thanks!
