How to build tensorflow for mips64el

The recommended way to build TensorFlow from source is using the Bazel open-source build system.
Howerver, bazel depends protobuf,grpc-java,osdetector etc.  protocbuf can build  successfully for mips64el. But i  build grpc-java  failed. details see #3012. i refer #2022. but osdetector-gradle-plugin occur error.
Could anybody give me some help for building tensorflow for mips64el arch?
