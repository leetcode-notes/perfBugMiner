Bazel version required for TensorFlow 1.0 ?

Hi all,
Neither the README.md nor https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources mentions the minimal bazel version that is required for building tensorflow 1.0 from source.
I have successfully built versions 0.9 and 0.10 from source using bazel 0.3.0 (first I had installed version 0.2.4, then while compiling tensorflow I got errors, opened an issue on github and was told to update to 0.3.0).
Now I tried building tensorflow 1.0 and the same story repeats. I get error messages, google for them. Google points me to a github issue (in this case #6436) and there people are told to upgrade bazel to a newer version (0.4.2).
Please start specifying somewhere a minimal requirement for the bazel version used to build a particular tensorflow version.
And if one needs to install a new bazel version each time one wants to install a newer tensorflow version, then please make bazel a part of tensorflow.
I am building a lot of software from source code. If you for instance look at other build systems as for example CMake. Most software that I build nowadays with CMake still builds fine with version 2.8.12, which was released in 2013. For CMake requiring a newer version is the exception, whereas for bazel it seems to be the rule.
Best regards
Sam
