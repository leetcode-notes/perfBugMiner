Small documentation error in iOS Example

I'm following the wonderfully comprehensive instructions here (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/README.md)  for building an iOS project with tensorflow with the makefile system.
The instructions, in the section "creating your own app" suggest adding
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen-latest
to the header search paths; however this folder does not exist after running the make scripts.
I believe it should be changed to
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen
(I have not seen anything suggesting tensorflow can be built for iOS using bazel, so I assume that this remains the recommended approach.)
