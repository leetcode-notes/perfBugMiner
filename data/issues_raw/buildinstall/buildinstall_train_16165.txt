Error when building from source Fedora 27 CUDA 9.1

System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Fedora 27
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version: r1.4
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version: 0.8.1
GCC/Compiler version: 7.2.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.1 cuDNN 7.0.5
GPU model and memory: NVidia Geforce GTX 960 4GB
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --verbose_failures //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
So I'm attempting to build tensorflow from source on fedora with the version of CUDA and cuDNN I already had installed to avoid have to also install an older version. The build however errors with the following message:
ERROR: .cache/bazel/_bazel_xd009642/f9f5dea1a139b69420e1045d339dda45/external/nccl_archive/BUILD:33:1: error while parsing .d file: /home/xd009642/.cache/bazel/_bazel_xd009642/f9f5dea1a139b69420e1045d339dda45/execroot/org_tensorflow/bazel-out/k8-py3-opt/bin/external/nccl_archive/_objs/nccl/external/nccl_archive/src/all_reduce.cu.pic.d (No such file or directory)

Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.392s, Critical Path: 0.12s

I also tried the command bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --incompatible_load_argument_is_label=false //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package from here with the same end result.
Any guidance is appreciated as this is my first time using bazel (and also trying to compile tensorflow).
