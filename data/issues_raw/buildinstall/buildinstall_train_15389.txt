Describe the problem
While trying to compile the latest TensorFlow(cloned from 798fa36), such error will be raised:
ERROR: /home/ubuntu/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/BUILD:64:1: error while parsing .d file: /home/ubuntu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_ubuntu/ad1e09741bb4109fbc70ef8216b59ee2/execroot/org_tensorflow/bazel-out/k8-py3-opt/bin/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/_objs/python/ops/_beam_search_ops_gpu/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/kernels/beam_search_ops_gpu.cu.pic.d (No such file or directory)

external/eigen_archive/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/../../../Eigen/Core:59:34: fatal error: math_functions.hpp: No such file or directory

It turns out that in CUDA 9.1, math_functions.hpp is located at cuda/include/crt/math_functions.hpp, rather than cuda/include/math_functions.hpp (CUDA 9.0 does), which leads to this error.
ln -s /usr/local/cuda/include/crt/math_functions.hpp /usr/local/cuda/include/math_functions.hpp will fix this problem and complete the compiling process.
