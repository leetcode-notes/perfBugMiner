'NoneType' object has no attribute 'keys' in version 1.0

I was trying to run tensorflow in docker. The command was this:
python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks \
--how_many_training_steps 500 \
--model_dir=/tf_files/inception \
--output_graph=/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
--output_labels=/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
--image_dir /tf_files/flower_photos

I put the error I got in the log
Environment info
Operating System: OS X

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
version 1.0

Logs or other output that would be helpful
