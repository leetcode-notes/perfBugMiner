Makefile downloads/ breaks ./configure

I'm rebuilding tf on Sierra and with CUDA 8.0 and Xcode 8.0 but ./configure fails with:
INFO: Starting clean (this may take a while). Consider using --expunge_async if the clean takes more than several minutes.

perhaps bazel has changed something about how it handles dependencies?
