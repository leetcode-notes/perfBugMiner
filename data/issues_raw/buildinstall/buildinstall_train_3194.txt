[install error] install failed on RedHat

In large scale cluster,  Entherprise RedHat system is mainstream distribution branch, and its always encounter a low version of kernel and libc problem.  There  several similar issue in this project.  I'm wondering that
1  is there any method to build tensorflow offline?
2  how can I build tensorflow cc part as static library instead of shared library.
3  is there any way to pay a cheap price to replace the bazel build tool?  Here we encounter a build tool bug.
bazelbuild/bazel#1474, which had been labeled as a bug in bazel, is there any alternative method?
Thanks
