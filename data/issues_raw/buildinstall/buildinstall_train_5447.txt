invalid conversion from 'cudnnDropoutStruct*' to 'int' [-fpermissive]

Hi all,
I am trying to compile tensorflow-0.11 + bazel 0.3.2 on RHEL 6 with cuda 7.0 + cudnn 7.5.5.0 + gcc 4.9.
The compilation command is :
EXTRA_BAZEL_ARGS="--jobs 10" bazel build -c opt --config=cuda --jobs 10 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
Compilation of rule '//tensorflow/stream_executor:stream_executor' fails with cuda specific message.
I have latest version of compilers at non standard path , hence i had modified some variables in CROSSTOOL.tpl + third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.tpl. I am attaching compilation error logs, CROSSTOOL.tpl and third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.tpl for your reference.
Though i am able to compile cpu-only version of tensorflow successfully.
Please let me know if any information is needed from my side.
Eagerly awaiting your replies.
