Cannot run example in tensorflow docker due to missing dependency

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): running in official docker container
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
Python version: 2.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0
GPU model and memory: Titan X
Exact command to reproduce:
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow

Describe the problem
The official tensorflow docker container does not include h5py. This might be intentional?
However, this breaks an example:

tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/learn/hdf5_classification.py

This also causes a number of contrib methods to raise exceptions:

tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/learn_io/data_feeder_test.py
a numbert of keras.contrib files
