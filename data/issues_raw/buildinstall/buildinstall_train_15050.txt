upgraded tensorflow to use GPU - she's a no worky anymore

Script was running fine (if a bit slow).  Decided it was  time to upgrade to the gpu version of tensorflow.  From what I can tell, for some reason it is looking for libcublas.so.8.0.  Since I just upgraded to the latest cuda libs, I'm running libcublas.so.9.0.176  (found in /usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64/) and, yes, that is in my path (first item, by the way).
Using TensorFlow backend.
