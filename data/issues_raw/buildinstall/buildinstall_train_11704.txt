ERROR: Failed to load Skylark extension '//tensorflow:workspace.bzl'.

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04
Bazel version : 0.5.2
python version : 3.5.2
tensorflow version : 1.2.0
Hello,
When I try this command :
bazel build tensorflow/examples/label_image:label_image && bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image --graph=/tmp/output_graph.pb --labels=/tmp/output_labels.txt --output_layer=final_result --image=$HOME/piscine/nvxpool/cad_image_182022_259650_1987_3303.jpg --input_layer=Mul --output_layer='final_result'
I have this error :
ERROR: Failed to load Skylark extension '//tensorflow:workspace.bzl'. It usually happens when the repository is not defined prior to being used. Maybe repository '' was defined later in your WORKSPACE file? ERROR: cycles detected during target parsing.
I do not understand because before restarting my computer this command worked. Do you have any ideas ?
(For information before restarting my computer I try this tutorial https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/mltools/tree/master/examples/polygon_classify_cnn [The section Getting Started]. Do you think the problem comes from there?)
Thanks
