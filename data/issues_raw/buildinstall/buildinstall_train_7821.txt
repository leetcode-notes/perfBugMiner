Cannot upgrade to CUDNN 5.1 (How to compile using CUDNN 5 and CUDA 7.5)

I am using a University Cluster with Tesla K80 with CUDA 7.5 and CUDnn 5.0.5. I don't have root access and cannot upgrade either CUDA or CUDnn. I have tried compiling TF 1.0 from sources using bazel by configuring CUDnn to 5.0.5. I am still experiencing this error while running deep mnist.

If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library to match.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime matches a compatible version specified during compile configuration.

However, the mnist with simple linear model worked. Please let me know a way around this and also if you need anything else.
Thanks
