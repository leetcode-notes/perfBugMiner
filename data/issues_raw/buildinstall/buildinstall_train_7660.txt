Failed to build with optimization flag AVX2

OS : Ubuntu 16.041
CPU : Intel i7 6700k
Which supports avx2.0.
I am trying to install Tensorflow from sources.
What I am doing
`./configure
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]:
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation [Default is -march=native]: AVX2
Do you wish to use jemalloc as the malloc implementation? (Linux only) [Y/n] y
jemalloc enabled on Linux
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N] n
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [y/N] n
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with the XLA just-in-time compiler (experimental)? [y/N] n
No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Found possible Python library paths:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages]
Using python library path: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL support? [y/N] n
No OpenCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N] y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow
Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]:
Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to use system default]: 8.0
Please specify the location where CUDA 8.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify the Cudnn version you want to use. [Leave empty to use system default]: 5.1.5
Please specify the location where cuDNN 5.1.5 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size.
[Default is: "3.5,5.2"]: 6.1

Now when I try to build got error,

If I go with out providing optimization flag its work fine.
