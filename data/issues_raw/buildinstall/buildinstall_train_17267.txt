CMP0002 error when building TensorFlow cc unit tests

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Window 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):VS2015 x64
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
When I tried to do TensorFlow CMake build on Window 10 like this,there is no error.
Then I tried to build cc unit tests. I added -Dtensorflow_BUILD_CC_TESTS=ON to the command
cmake .. -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:\swigwin-3.0.12\swigwin-3.0.12\swig.exe -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=D:\Local\anaconda3\python.exe -DPYTHON_LIBRARIES=D:\Local\anaconda3\libs\python36.lib -Dtensorflow_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=ON -Dtensorflow_BUILD_CC_TESTS=ON
The cmake infomation is as following:

but I got several errors like the following
CMake Error at tf_tests.cmake:73 (add_executable):
