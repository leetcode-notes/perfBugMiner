Bazel unable to build on Jetson TX1 with --config=cuda option?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1 (latest master)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1
GPU model and memory: Tegra X1
Exact command to reproduce:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
Using the bazel build command above, I am unable to find a valid toolchain to support the aarch64 architecture in the Jetson TX1. However, by removing the --config=cuda option, the error is gone, although I am still unable to finish building the pip file (probably due to the fact that I configured TF for GPU using ./configure).
Note: I changed the bazel files as seen in this guide: http://zhiyisun.github.io/2017/02/15/Running-Google-Machine-Learning-Library-Tensorflow-On-ARM-64-bit-Platform.html , in order to get bazel to build for aarch64.
Is there anything more that I have to change? using the suggested command of bazel build -c opt --copt="-funsafe-math-optimizations" --copt="-ftree-vectorize" --copt="-fomit-frame-pointer" --verbose_failures tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package I get the same error too.
I saw this issue over here: bazelbuild/bazel#1855
and it says it has something related to the cuda crosstool. Is there a way to fix this to configure TensorFlow-GPU on the Jetson TX1?
Thank you for your help. :D
