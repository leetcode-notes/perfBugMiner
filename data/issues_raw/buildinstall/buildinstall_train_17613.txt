Error with Installing tensorflow error using Virtualenv

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No custom code was written steps followed from the installtensorflow webpage:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OSX El Capitan version 10.11.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): error in installing tensorflow
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: Python 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): not sure
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: MacBook Pro 13 inch(early 2011), Processor: 2.3 GHz Intel Core I5, Memory: 16GB 1333 MHz DDR3, Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB
Exact command to reproduce:  error when using the following command
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/tensorflow


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I am trying to install tensorflow for mac os El Capitan, using Virtualenv as instructed in the tensorflow installation webpage: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac these are the steps i have taken and errors recieved:
1.Start a terminal (a shell). You'll perform all subsequent steps in this shell.

Installed pip and Virtualenv sucessfully by issuing the following commands:

$ sudo easy_install pip
$ pip install --upgrade virtualenv

successfully Created a Virtualenv environment by issuing a command of one of the python 3 format:

$ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/tensorflow
the following e4 errors were displayed in terminal after step 3:
ERROR: The executable /Users/User/tensorflow/bin/python3 is not functioning
ERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is '/Users/User' (should be '/Users/User/tensorflow')
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable

I get an error when doing step 4 :Activate the Virtualenv environment by issuing one of the    following commands:

$ cd targetDirectory
$ source ./bin/activate      # If using bash, sh, ksh, or zsh
$ source ./bin/activate.csh  # If using csh or tcsh
the error i ger is: -bash: ./bin/activate: No such file or directory
Please help with this problem is greatly appreciated,  I have tried 1 other times using different methods to install tensorflow and it hasn't worked. Next ill try native pip method.
i have attached a terminal screenshot of the whole process:
