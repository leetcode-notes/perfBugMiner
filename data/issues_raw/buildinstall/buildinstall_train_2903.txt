What I have tried


Removed any Ubuntu protobuf package (Ubuntu package is v 2.6.1):
sudo apt purge protobuf*


Upgraded protobuf via pip3:
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf
...
Requirement already up-to-date: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages Requirement already up-to-date: six>=1.9 in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from protobuf) Requirement already up-to-date: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages (from protobuf)


Checked protobuf version installed via pip3:
ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/proto*
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/protobuf-3.0.0b2-py2.7-nspkg.pth

Additional comments
As before ( #1373) this ONLY occurs when importing Gtk BEFORE tensorflow. The opposite order causes no crash, nor have I experienced any other crashes associated with tensorflow.
Curiously, when using version 0.8 of tensorflow, a very similar crash was caused by the opposite order of import (ie tensorflow before Gtk), but in that case the output was that: This program requires version 2.6.1 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 3.0.0. That is, the problem seemed to be caused by the reverse relationship between the protobuf versions. However, when upgrading tensorflow, I did not change the protobuf version. It was kept the same throughout.
