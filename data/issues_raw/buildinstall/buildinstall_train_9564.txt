No module named tensorflow (problem with python 2)

Hi,
I'm trying to install tensorflow on this machine:
Ubuntu 16.04
cuda 8.0
cudnn 5.1
python 2.7 (no Anaconda)
I installed tensorflow on both python 3 and python 2. It works with python 3 but with python 2 always gives the import error: No module named tensorflow.
What can I do to solve this?
Thanks
