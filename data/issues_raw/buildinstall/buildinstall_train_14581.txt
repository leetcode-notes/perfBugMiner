Generate benchmark_model (android arm64-v8a) executable in case of tensorflow lite

Hello i tried the sameway defined in the Readme.md of "tensorflow/contrib/makefile" folder to build benchmark_model for  tensorflow lite (tensorflow/contrib/lite/). However, it failed and seems that "TARGET=ANDROID" is not working in caseof Makefile of "tensorflow/contrib/lite/" folder.
ERROR LOG:
/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/lite/downloads/gemmlowp/public/../internal/../internal/kernel_default.h:89:2: error: #error "SIMD not enabled, you'd be getting a slow software fallback. Consider enabling SIMD extensions (for example using -msse4 if you're on modern x86). If that's not an option, and you would like to continue with the slow fallback, define GEMMLOWP_ALLOW_SLOW_SCALAR_FALLBACK."
