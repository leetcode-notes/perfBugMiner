import(ing) tensorflow fails to load at runtime.

I have written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
using the Keras wrapper.  That works, but system failure and re-installation (new machine) provided the following:
Python 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
