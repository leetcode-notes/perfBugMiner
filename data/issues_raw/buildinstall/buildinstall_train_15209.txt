CMake: If/else statement in CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS breaks CMake build on Ubuntu 17.10

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 17.10.
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source (CMake)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2cfb088 (tip of master at time of writing)
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.2.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: cmake ../../tensorflow/contrib/cmake && make

Source code / logs

Cause
In v1.4.0, you will find the argument -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=ON given to  CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS for several external projects (png, zlip, sqlite etc). In master, this has been changed to
CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS
	if(tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE)
		-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=ON
	else()
		-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=OFF
	endif()

which yields the following init cache entries on my machine:
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE "ON;if;(;tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE;);else;(;)" CACHE BOOL "Initial cache" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE "OFF;endif;(;)" CACHE BOOL "Initial cache" FORCE)

and the build fails because CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ends up not being set to ON. I could imagine this breaks a lot of builds. Perhaps CMake behaves differently on Windows and therefore this has not been caught? Is there a reason for this change I am not aware of?
Solution
A possible solution is to not inline the if/else statement and instead use the argument
-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=${tensorflow_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE}
