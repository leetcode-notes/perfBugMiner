A link to the pip package you installed: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)": 0.12.0

The error comes from the binary packages indicated above. I had no problems with the package builded from source.

I guess seeing the problem is that I use inside a new Op some functions from this part of the core:
#include "tensorflow/core/lib/core/stringpiece.h"

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
This thing is strange because as I said with the package created from the source code I have no error during the execution of the script, but with the binary package provided from the official website I had the runtime error below.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
