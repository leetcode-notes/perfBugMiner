tensorboard raises `FailedPreconditionError`

Description
Tensorboard always raises the exception FailedPreconditionError in my environment. I have it running with parameter logdir pointing to a directory that is tracking active experiments. Tensorboard raises an exception after a few minutes with a Traceback similar to the following:
tensorboard --debug --logdir .

FailedPreconditionError: /media/data/sarroff/experiments/source_separation/logdir3/train/161031224434/model.ckpt-263550.index
The accompanying exception message mentions a different file every time and the exception is raised at some arbitrary time after execution. It is therefore not easy to replicate my issue deterministically.
Environment
Ubuntu 16.04LTS
TensorFlow commit 1fcd6d1
Proposed Cause
This is just a guess; I'm not too familiar with the code: The exception is raised in FileSystem::GetMatchingPaths. Perhaps, while traversing the directory, some files get incorrectly marked as directories. If so, then the error probably happens during the call to opendir in PosixFileSystem::GetChildren. Error codes which are mapped to FailedPreconditionError are listed in tensorflow/core/platform/posix/error.cc. A likely error code causing the exception is ENOTDIR. I don't have an explanation as to why files would occasionally be incorrectly marked as directories. Perhaps there is a problem unique to my environment.
I've also noticed the recent Issue #4921, which specifically mentions problems with FileSystem::GetMatchingPaths. Perhaps this issue is connected with that one.
