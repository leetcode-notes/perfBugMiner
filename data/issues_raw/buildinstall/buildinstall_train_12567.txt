Tensorflow should not depend on tensorboard

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): irrelevant
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (the issue is about pip dependencies)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version: 3.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/6.0
GPU model and memory: irrelevant
Exact command to reproduce: pip install tensorflow

Describe the problem
I wish to install tensorflow without having to install tensorboard.
Currently there is a circular dependency between tensorflow and tensorboard.  However, tensorflow runs perfectly well without tensorboard, therefore the dependency should be removed. Additionally having a simpler dependency structure would facilitate packaging for NixOS.
