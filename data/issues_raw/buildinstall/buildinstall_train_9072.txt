Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)?: No, this is an installation issue.
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)?: Source
TensorFlow version: 1.0.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): Build label: 0.4.5-homebrew
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0.71
GPU Model and Memory: NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, 2048 MB
Exact command to reproduce: From Installing Tensorflow from sources (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#PrepareMac): bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem clearly
Receiving the following error when trying to build from source:
  $ bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package  
    ERROR: Inconsistent crosstool configuration; no toolchain corresponding to 'local_darwin' found for cpu 'darwin'.  
    INFO: Elapsed time: 0.101s  

I'm wondering if 'local_darwin' is an incorrect parameter in the TensorFlow bazel build setup files.  If so, they need to be corrected and updated.
