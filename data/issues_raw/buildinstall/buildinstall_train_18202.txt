Submit Raspberry Pi releases to piwheels.org

I maintain the piwheels project where we build Arm platform Python wheels on Raspberry Pi, and provide them to Raspbian users (pre-configured in pip.conf) for speedy installs. As well as automating building most packages, we're able to manually import wheels built elsewhere.
It's great that you're now providing Raspberry Pi builds on Jenkins, but the current (undocumented) installation process is to pip install from the URL of the file on Jenkins. If you were able to upload these wheels to piwheels, users would just be able to pip install tensorflow and get it.
However, you seem to provide wheels for Python 2.7 and 3.4 (but not 3.5, which is the version which ships with Raspbian Stretch). Would you be able to build for Python 3.5 as well?
Also you give your wheels a platform tag of any which is naughty. The platform reported on Pi 1/Zero is linux_armv6l and on Pi 2/3 is linux_armv7l.
If you can provide the following wheels for v1.7 (and future releases submitted to pypi - no need for nightlies):

Python 2.7 Armv6
Python 3.4 Armv6
Python 3.5 Armv6
Python 2.7 Armv7
Python 3.4 Armv7
Python 3.5 Armv7

then I can upload them to piwheels and Raspberry Pi users will have them available no hassle.
Thanks!
