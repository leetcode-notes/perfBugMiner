Wrong protobuf BUILD rule while compiling tensorflow on powerpc

Describe the problem
I tried to build Tensorflow from sources. While ./configureing, I did the following;
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -mcpu=native]: -mcpu=native -mtune=native
because I'm on a powerpc. (-march=native is not recognized, already denoted by [Default -mcpu=native])
After executing bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package, it starts to download and compile protobuf, I immediately get the following,
ERROR: /home/powerpc/.cache/bazel/_bazel_powerpc/7ad07c846e34c4f733a905eaa47f3cba/external/protobuf_archive/BUILD:265:1: C++ compilation of rule '@protobuf_archive//:js_embed' failed (Exit 1). gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-march=native' Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build Use --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps. INFO: Elapsed time: 18.579s, Critical Path: 6.01s
I believe this stems from a wrong BUILD rule for protobuf, it defaults to [-march=native]. I wasn't able to find the relevant BUILD file to fix.
Edit
After trying again, this time I get the same error for highwayhash. This is about third_party packages, should I have to edit all BUILD rules manually?
