Describe the problem
I've installed tensorflow v1.7.0 via PIP and I am having issues working with it. Upon entering a REPL and attempting to import tensorflow the REPL silently exits with an exit code of 132. I've run PDB and tried importing it and it appears it is exiting around the from tensorflow.python import * section of the tensorflow code. Looking at the PDB output it appears that code is exiting with error code 132 after running importlib._bootstrap._find_and_load which is a python internal.
Source code / logs
PDB output from trying to import tensorflow (around the section that it exits):
