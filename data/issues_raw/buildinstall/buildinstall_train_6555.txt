[minor] Non-silenced `pushd` followed by `popd` in `tensorflow/configure`

tensorflow/configure has the following lines:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -o pipefail

# Find out the absolute path to where ./configure resides
pushd `dirname $0` #> /dev/null
SOURCE_BASE_DIR=`pwd -P`
popd > /dev/null
I am not sure what is the purpose of the pushd followed by popd without change in directory. I think this is not necessary, and distracts when reading the source codes. Unless it is allowed to run the configure from the directory other than the tensorflow root, it is completely redundant.
Also, the > /dev/null is commented out which causes the current directory to print when running the script:
$ ./configure
  ~/GitHub/tensorflow ~/GitHub/tensorflow
