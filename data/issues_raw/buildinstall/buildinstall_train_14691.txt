compile failed for tf-gpu 1.4, cuda 9, cudnn 7, vc 2017, windows 10.

I would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me out with compiling.
I followed #5600 and #13962 in compiling the wheel, however when building i got into 6 types of in total 90 errors. Respectively c2070, c2059, c2064, c2001, c1057, c2146.
My build command was:
cmake .. -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^ -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:/swigwin-3.0.12/swig.exe ^ -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python.exe ^ -DPYTHON_LIBRARIES=C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/libs/python36_lib ^ -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/Include ^ -DNUMPY_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/lib/site-packages/numpy/core/include ^ -Dtensorflow_ENABLE_GPU=ON ^ -DCUDNN_HOME="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0" ^ -Dtensorflow_WIN_CPU_SIMD_OPTIONS=/arch:AVX
Everything looks good until the compiler_arch_native_support failed.
It manage to configure the build so I continue with:
MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj
The last 9999 line of the failed log is here.
tf-compile-build-error-log.txt
Warmest Regards,
