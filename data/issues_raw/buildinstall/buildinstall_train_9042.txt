Compiling a custom Op - Eigen including-loop

System Info.

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)?: Yes
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)?: binary
TensorFlow version: latest
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1
GPU Model and Memory: Quadro k1100m
Exact command to reproduce: trying to build

The problem
I'm tyring to build the code in
https://github.com/davidstutz/tensorflow-cpp-op-example
for Windows. The Windows version of Tf does not install with the source code so I cloned the repo and added the path to CMake. I then executed CMake as described in
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake
Yet the problem seems to be that the Eigen files don't do anything but re-including themselves.
Were they not meant to be included? Am I using some wrong flags that result in those imports? Other ideas? suggestions?
Cheers,
