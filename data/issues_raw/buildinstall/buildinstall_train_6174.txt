DBPEDIA_URL is not a valid download url anymore

DBPEDIA_URL in text_datasets.py is not a valid url anymore because web hosting in Google Drive has been deprecated, https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2015/08/deprecating-web-hosting-support-in.html
Proposed fix:

Move dbpedia_csv.tar.gz to cloud storage.

What is affected:

Text classification examples that depend on DBpedia data like text_classification.py are now broken.
