Compiling TensorFlow on Windows with NVIDIA 9.1 GPU?

Does anyone have this working, prior to 1.3.0 the nightly builds at tensorflow had GPU builds, these no longer appear to be available.
I have the build running and makes it through all tests until the 'end', There are multiple errors shown below.  After reviewing other posts it appears that the GPU build with Windows is not working?
