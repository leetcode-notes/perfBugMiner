msvcp140.dll missing on win 7

Hi everyone :)
I installed Tensorflow on Windows 7 ultimate with Python 3.5.4, via the pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow command. It even stated it successfully installed version 1.4
But if I try to invoke import tensorflow as tf in the shell I get the following error:

Of course I installed the recommended Visual C++ 2015 Redistributablle 64bit Update 3, but there is neither the .dll file in my system folder, nor does tensorflow work. I get the same error as before.
Any help is appreciated, Thank you :)
