Is it possible to remove the "third_party directory"?! [An attempt to package for Ubuntu]

Hi guys,
We have successfully used C/C++ API as shared library in our applications, but there are some issues like this one which my colleages ran into.
Simultaneously, I was working to distribute the whole work as a debian package for Ubuntu 16.04, and I found that it is very annoying that you have used many external dependencies under the "third_party" directory. I'm trying to remove these dependencies one by one, which is a little bit troublesome but I think is possible. I am packaging anything else needed on my way.
The question is, do you have any advise on this? What should have been taken care of? And why in first place you put these in your repo instead of leading the users to install specific versions on their system as build dependency? I think that having external header files under the directory after build does not make sense at all! Please lighten me up.
Thanks for your great work, Google and The Community!
