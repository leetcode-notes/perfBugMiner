Optimization flags are erroneously ignored in compilation of Tensorflow 1.1.0-rc1

I am getting a large number of optimization flag related warnings in compilation of Tensorflow 1.1.0-rc1 from source
/usr/include/features.h:330:4: warning: #warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O) [-Wcpp]
 #  warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O)
    ^

System Information:
OS:CentOS 7
GCC: gcc 4.8.5
Python: python3.5
Tensorflow version:  TensorFlow 1.1.0-rc1
Bazel:  version 0.4.5
CUDA: CUDA 8.0 with GTX 1080 GPU
in the prompt of ./configure:
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]: /usr/bin/python3.5
Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: 
Do you wish to use jemalloc as the malloc implementation? [Y/n] Y
jemalloc enabled
Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [y/N] n

explicitly typing -march=native -O2 or -O2 in the line Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]:"doesn't help.
to compile I used:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
I tried as early as tensorflow version 1.0.0 and I always get the "warning _FORTIFY_SOURCE requires compiling with optimization (-O)". Tensorflow version 0.12.1 doesn't seem to have this problem for me.
