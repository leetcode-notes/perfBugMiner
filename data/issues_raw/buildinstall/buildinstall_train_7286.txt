Upload sdists to PyPI

Hi.
It appears that PyPI only contains wheels for tensorflow:
https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/#files
Thanks for uploading those! Wheels are great.
But sdists are good to have too -- specifically, I'm not sure whether tensorflow works on PyPy (I'm about to try it out -- EDIT: now I've seen #252, which I might try to help on) but not having sdists uploaded makes that harder to try without hunting down this repository.
