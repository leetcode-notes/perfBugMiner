Describe the problem
Previous night I successfully configured and installed TensorFlow. Tonight I'm going to try the exact process but when configuring always the following error is appeared:
INFO: Timeout connecting to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/r77/examples/js/controls/\
OrbitControls.js

After I changed my proxy server, it timeout connecting to another url. It is related to #6613.
Is it possible to download links locally?
