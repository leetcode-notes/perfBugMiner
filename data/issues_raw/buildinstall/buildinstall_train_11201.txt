bazel build causes Kernel Panic on clean Ubuntu 16.04

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Trying for source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 5.1
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GTX 750 Ti
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

Describe the problem
I get through a fair chunk of the build process then I get hit with:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Timeout: Not all cpus entered broadcast exception handler
The computer then reboots after about 30 seconds.  This is on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
