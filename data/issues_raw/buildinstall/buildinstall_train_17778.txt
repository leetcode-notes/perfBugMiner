Bad_alloc when building standalone project in Debug

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): Most recent, pulled from github
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): VS 2015
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU Only
Bazel version:  NA
GPU model and memory:  NA
Exact command to reproduce: Practically any  tensorflow command in debug

I have a large project (C++) that uses a CNN for a small part of the code. I have built tensorflow from sources as a shared library using the cmake instructions. I have linked against this built library and integrated it in our code. The project uses QTCreator and Qmake.
In currently works perfect in Release mode, however as it is a larger project there is needs to occasionally build in debug. When doing a debug build I get an exception thrown on basically the first instance of tensorflow (currently a call to ReadBinaryProto). If you comment that line out it will break on the next tensorflow call.
I have built a standalone project in visual studio 2015 that isolates the tensorflow part of the project and it behaves exactly the same way.
The exception is Microsoft C++ exception: std::bad_alloc at memory location 0x00000071F8AFC730.
I know there is no supported way to build a debug version of the library, but I need to use this library like this. I have no pressing need to debug tensorflow related code just the rest of it.
Thank you
