TF_CUDA_VERSION and TF_CUDNN_VERSION can be too specific

If you run ./configure and provide your own TF_CUDA_VERSION and TF_CUDNN_VERSION, you will get an error message if your version is too specific.
For example, setting TF_CUDA_VERSION=7.5.18 will result in an error when nvcc reports a version 7.5. If you set TF_CUDNN_VERSION=5.1.3, you get an error because cudnn.h reports version 5.
I think in previous versions of TensorFlow this didn't happen, and it's only a minor annoyance, but it would be nice to fix this.
