tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

I created an environment with following command on Windows:
conda create --name tensorflow python=3.5 anaconda

and try to install tensorflow 1.0
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensor flow_gpu-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_x86_64.whl

but it reported an error as following:
tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0-cp35-cp35m-win_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

my machine is 64bit win10, can anyone tell me  what's the problem?
