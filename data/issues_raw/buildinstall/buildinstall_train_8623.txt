TensorFlow install issue

Hi Team .,
While installing TensorFlow on Windows10 I'm facing the below error.,

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Please let me know how to overcome this issue.
Thanks
Pavan
