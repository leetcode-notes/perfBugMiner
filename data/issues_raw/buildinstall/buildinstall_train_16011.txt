Tensorboard issue with the official docker image - 1.5.0-rc0-gpu-py3

Hello everyone,
I have the exact same issue as stated here: #14855
And on the official tensorboard repository: tensorflow/tensorboard#812
The fact that I am using the official Docker Image and I didn't build anything from scratch.
tensorflow/tensorflow 1.5.0-rc0-gpu-py3 9e770d59b136 6 days ago 2.85GB
What I get when I try to launch Tensorboard as usual:
# tensorboard --logdir=log_directory
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.
  from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/tensorboard", line 7, in <module>
    from tensorboard.main import run_main
ImportError: cannot import name 'run_main'

Resolution Idea:
I noticed that by simply running the command: pip install tensorboard inside the container the problem is solved and I am able to normally launch Tensorboard.
Thanks a lot for the help,
All the best,
Jonathan
