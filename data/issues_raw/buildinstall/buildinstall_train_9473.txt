ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

Problem
I have problem running tensorflow, I am quite new in using tensorflow and Python, hence pardon me if this is stupid question to ask. The problem is when I tried running tensorflow in windows command prompt, it worked just fine but then it give me ModuleNotFoundError when I tried running it through .py file. Is there something wrong? Please help me, thank you
