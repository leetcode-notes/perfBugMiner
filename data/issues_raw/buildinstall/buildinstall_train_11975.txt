CMake build with -Dtensorflow_BUILD_ALL_KERNELS=OFF does not work

Problem:
When building Tensorflow via CMake, specifying option tensorflow_BUILD_ALL_KERNELS=OFF leads to failed linker step due to unresolved external functions, because many important files (that are not kernels, but are necessary) are not included in build's list of sources (like ops_util.cc, but also other files).
Reproduction:
Follow instruction in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/README.md, specify -Dtensorflow_BUILD_ALL_KERNELS=OFF to cmake.
