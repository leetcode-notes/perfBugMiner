./configure should be made script friendly

Building tensorflow artefacts today is made difficult by the fact that the ./configure script requires interactive inputs. For default automated builds, one solution is: echo "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" | ./configure (or yes '' and catching the error) but this is far from satisfactory, and tweaking the parameter is even more difficult.
See Homebrew/homebrew-core#10273 (comment) for instance in homebrew, but other packager will presumably hit the same issue.
