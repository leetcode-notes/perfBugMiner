[building tensorflow with bazel ] Error:C++ compilation of rule '@boringssl//:crypto' failed.

Environment:
GCC 4.9.1
glibc :2.11.3
bazel:0.4.0/0.4.5/0.5.3(these versions have been tried)
OS: SUSE
It seems that boringssl can't work with command bazel build --copt=-march=native -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package. Here is the  log:
