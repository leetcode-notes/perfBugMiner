Downgrade to Bazel 0.4.2 for Tensorflow r1.0

Hello,
I need to checkout to Tensorflow r1.0 and as suggested the Bazel version should be 0.4.2
I have already installed Bazel and after upgrade bazel version is 0.7.0
Do you know the steps so I can downgrade to Bazel 0.4.2?
I have tried with apt-get install bazel=0.4.2 but this does not work,
and I have also tried to uninstall by executing the command rm -fr ~/.bazel ~/.bazelrc and deleting relevant data in ~/.cache/bazel/ folder, but this did not also work.
Any suggestions ?
Thank you in advance
