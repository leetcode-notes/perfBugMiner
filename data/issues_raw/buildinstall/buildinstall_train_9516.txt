Tensor flow cannot be imported properly in windows

I have installed CPU version of Tensor flow in my laptop using the command line using pip install.
OS: Windows 8.1 64 bit Python 3.5.1
But, when I tried importing it in the python 3.5.1 it throws the following error message.

import _pywrap_tensorflow ImportError: No module named '_pywrap_tensorflow' Error importing tensorflow. Unless you are using bazel, you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory; please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter from there.

I have tried getting answers in Stackoverflow, but no hope. I have even tried changing the directories but nothing works.
I am new to python. Please help me to solve this issue !!
