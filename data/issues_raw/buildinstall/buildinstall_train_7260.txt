If installed from binary pip package, provide:
v 0.12.0
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
_actv_module = tf.load_op_library('/actv.so')
print(_actv_module.OP_LIST)
When act.so situated in some directories I see the list of Ops in it (as it should be).
When I copy it to another directories list of Ops is empty. I can't find any reason why some directories are different from other. In both cases path is correct -- load_op_library is able to find file.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I tried to copy source files to "problem" directories and compile it there (according to Adding new Op manual, compile with GPU support) -- with same results.
More strange -- I made a copy of all source files with another names, compiled it in "normal" directory, and load_op_library can't find Ops in it!
Logs or other output that would be helpful
Attached: sources -- actv.cc, actv_kernel.cu.cc
Normal libs -- actv.so, actv_kernel.cu.o
"Corrupted" libs (in which load_op_library can't see any ops) -- actv_corrupted.so, actv_kernel_corrupted.cu.o
