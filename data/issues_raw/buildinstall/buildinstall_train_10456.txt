Default CUDA / cuDNN version not used in template string

When leaving version for CUDA / cuDNN empty, to default to 8.0 / 6, they are not properly used in the template at marks blank
Please specify the Cuda SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 8.0]:
Please specify the location where CUDA blank toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]:
Please specify the location where cuDNN blank library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:
Instead, there is just a two-space gap.
The script seems to miss a proper fallback for TF_CUDA_VERSION / TF_CUDNN_VERSION unset.
