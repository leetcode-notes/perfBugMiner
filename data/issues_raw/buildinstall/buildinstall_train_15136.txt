Tensorflow is pulling enum34 in Python 3.5 and 3.6, which breaks code completion in Spyder

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: 3.5, 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: pip install tensorflow

Describe the problem
When you run
pip install tensorflow

in a virtualenv with Python 3.5 or 3.6, one of the dependencies pulled by pip is enum34, as the following console output shows
$ pip install tensorflow

This package is only necessary if Python < 3.4, as described here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34/1.1.6
so it's an error that tensorflow pullis it for Python 3.5 and 3.6.
Besides, this package breaks Spyder code completion machinery in its Editor, as it has been verified by several users. See for example:
spyder-ide/spyder#5782.
