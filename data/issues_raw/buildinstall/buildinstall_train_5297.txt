Issue on Compile protobuf.sh?

Hi,
I am trying to setup latest version from tensorflow for iOS, in the process first step to  run download_dependencies.sh works fine, and then in the next step to run the compile_ios_protobuf.sh  is resulting in following error:
.....
glibtoolize: copying file 'm4/ltsugar.m4'
glibtoolize: copying file 'm4/ltversion.m4'
glibtoolize: copying file 'm4/lt~obsolete.m4'
configure.ac:61: installing './compile'
configure.ac:48: installing './missing'
benchmarks/Makefile.am: installing './depcomp'
+ rm -rf autom4te.cache config.h.in~
+ exit 0
+ '[' 0 -ne 0 ']'
+ make distclean
make: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.

Let me know If I am missing anything, Please guide.
Thanks
