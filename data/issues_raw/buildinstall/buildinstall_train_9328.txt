Error in `python`: free(): invalid pointer

TensorFlow Version: 1.0 and 1.0.1 (whl package)
Kubernetes Version: 1.5.1
Docker Version: 1.12.5
Container OS: ubuntu 14.04
I run tensorflow applications, say mnist_replica.py, in the kubernetes cluster and this error occured everytime when finishing the whole train step.
I attached the log of mnist_replica.py as below:
1492616963.574406: Worker 0: training step 5045 done (global step: 9999)
1492616963.583257: Worker 0: training step 5046 done (global step: 10001)
Training ends @ 1492616963.583282
Training elapsed time: 54.435048 s
After 10000 training step(s), validation cross entropy = 1170.07
*** Error in `/usr/bin/python': free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000000001e16c50 ***

And everything goes well when I run the mnist_replica.py in a physical machine with RHEL 7.0. I Guess the problem is that your google's environment is different with me. So the whl package that you compiled can not run well in the ubuntu 14.04 container, especially when it comes to the C program calling Python program
