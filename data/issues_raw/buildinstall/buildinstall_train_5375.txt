Error cloning linenoise

This is a helpful note for anyone who might come across the following error, building tensorflow on arch linux (I may also have some funky ssh-agent settings causing this issue):
ERROR: /home/user/testing/tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/tfprof/BUILD:22:1: no such package '@linenoise//': Error cloning repository: ssh://git@github.com/antirez/linenoise/archive/1.0.tar.gz: Auth cancel caused by ssh://git@github.com/antirez/linenoise/archive/1.0.tar.gz: Auth cancel caused by Auth cancel and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/tfprof:tfprof'.

ERROR: Evaluation of query "deps((//tensorflow/... union @bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain))" failed: errors were encountered while computing transitive closure.

I was able to remedy this problem by changing the block for linenoise tensorflow/workspace.bzl:181 to:
  native.new_local_repository(
    name = "linenoise",
    path = "/path/to/local_repository",
    build_file = str(Label("//:linenoise.BUILD")),
  )
