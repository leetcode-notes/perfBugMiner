Jenkins' PR builds have been failing regularly since Aug. 10

I don't know if the commonality is the state of master when the branches for these changes were taken, or if there is something endemic to the current builders, or ? but the failures appear to have nothing to do with actual code changes being submitted in at least some cases.
