Building the library on Raspberry Pi results in: undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string'

Hello,
I was told to post this question here:
I am trying to complete a fresh install of Tensorflow on my Raspberry Pi following a failed previous install. I figured it would be easier trying to start fresh so I could more easily document my progress, and what solutions worked or failed. Additionally the new guide is easier to follow than the old guide I was using.
I am following the guide here and have been able to complete all of the steps up until the make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI OPTFLAGS="-Os" CXX=g++-4.8command. NOTE: I did not install the example graph.
However when attempting to run this command I am left with several errors. The full output is rather long, but the main recurring error is similar to:
test_log.pb.cc:(.text+0x784): undefined reference togoogle::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string'This kind of error is repeated several times throughout the output for themake -f command with test_log.pb.cc:(.text+0x784): ` being replaced with different designations. The output ends with the Following error state:
step_stats_collector.cc:(.text+0x46c): undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string'
/home/pi/makevoicedemo/tf/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/lib/libtensorflow-core.a(debug_io_utils.o):debug_io_utils.cc:(.text+0x8e8): more undefined references to `google::protobuf::internal::fixed_address_empty_string' follow
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile:501: recipe for target '/home/pi/makevoicedemo/tf/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark' failed
make: *** [/home/pi/makevoicedemo/tf/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/bin/benchmark] Error 1

I feel like the problem is likely do to an error with protobuf, however I am using the latest version and had no errors installing it. I am using the most recent version of tensorflow and followed the Before you start section in the guide to make sure all dependencies were installed and up to date.
What exactly might be causing this error and how would I go about fixing it?

If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Steps taken (in order) from pre-created directory /tf:
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git

cd tensorflow

tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh

sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake libtool gcc-4.8 g++-4.8

cd tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf/

./autogen.sh

./configure

make

sudo make install

sudo ldconfig

cd ../../../../..

make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI OPTFLAGS="-Os" CXX=g++-4.8

The final command results in the error and is as far as I have been able to progress.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I have not come across any applicable solutions to try.
Any help would be appreciated.
