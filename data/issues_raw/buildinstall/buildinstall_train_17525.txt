Build errors for non-Android build with lite proto runtime

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Minor modifications to tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile to allow for lite proto runtime
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Gentoo-based
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A (using Makefile)
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): clang++ 6.6.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:


Patch Makefile to add -DTENSORFLOW_LITE_PROTOS to CXXFLAGS
make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile ... (as in tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_linux.sh)

Describe the problem
A few files fail to compile because they rely on either:

Lite runtime protos only being used in Android builds (i.e. when __ANDROID__ is true), or
All protos being Message objects (whereas they are MessageLiteobjects with the lite runtime).

Source code / logs
The specific errors stem from the use of proto.DebugString() in the following files:
core/framework/reader_base.cc
core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc
core/grappler/costs/utils.cc
core/grappler/grappler_item_builder.cc
core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc
core/grappler/optimizers/dependency_optimizer.cc
and the use of the ReadTextProto function in core/grappler/inputs/utils.cc.
I will attempt to fix this problem myself, and will use this bug to track my progress and ask questions.
