Fail to compile binary for Android

Is there simple way to compile a native binary for inference on Android? Now I can successfully build the benchmark and run it on my Android device. But it does not contain any actions about ops. I want to do something similar to the benchmark_model_test but it fails to build. I think it now lacks a android version of //tensorflow/cc APIs. How can I tackle it?
