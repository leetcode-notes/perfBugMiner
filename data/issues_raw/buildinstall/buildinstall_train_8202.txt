build_config.bzl file modified by configure

configure modifies build_config.bzl to set the WITH_JEMALLOC flag.  This is inconvenient when using git, since it means I can't pull after doing configure without manually clearing the file.
Can the setup be modified so that configure makes a file not under git control?
