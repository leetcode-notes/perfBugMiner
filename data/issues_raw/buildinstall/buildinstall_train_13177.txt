cmake: No session factory registered for the given session options

Hi everyone,
I have built the static library for tensorflow with cmake in Windows and I have the error "No session factory registered for the given session options ". This issue is fixed with the flag /Wholearchive, however it seems there is not equivalent flag for Qt creator. So, my question is if someone knows if the static library built with bazel has the same issue (add the flag /wholearchive) in windows? I have read that someone people didinÂ´t have this issue with bazel in Linux, but it would be great if someone can confirm it for Windows.
Thanks for your help.
