Build "general" shared library for Android to use with Android Make

Luckily there is a very good introduction into programming with Tensorflow on an Android device provided here:
https://github.com/miyosuda/TensorFlowAndroidDemo
The version of TF used in this project is 0.10 which doesn't work with my trained model coming from TF 0.12. I was wondering which is the best way to have a "generalized" shared library (or however this is called), built with bazel that I could use interchangeably like the one provided in the project mentioned above.
I was able to build the TF-Android Example using Bazel. My Anrdoid-project, which uses Tensorflow, also needs OpenCV to work. Therefore I'm building my App with a make-file which worked quiet well so far.
Maybe I'm completely wrong, as I'm not really a programmer - so far. Thank you for any advice.
