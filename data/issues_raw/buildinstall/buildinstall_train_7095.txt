Same Issue with latest Tensorflow on windows when using TensorForestEstimator

Already this issue was created before and it's closed, but the issue was not resolved yet.
hparams = tf.contrib.tensor_forest.python.tensor_forest.ForestHParams(
num_trees=2, max_nodes=1000, num_classes=2, num_features=9, model_dir='model/fit/')
forest_classifier = tf.contrib.learn.TensorForestEstimator(hparams)
