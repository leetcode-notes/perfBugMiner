Building TensorFlow with CPU SIMD OPTIONS enabled on Windows 10 FAILED

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master
Bazel version (if compiling from source): No
CUDA/cuDNN version: No
GPU model and memory: No
Exact command to reproduce:MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release /filelogger tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
I was following the instructions to build tensorflow on Windows
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r0.12/tensorflow/contrib/cmake
The error came when I tried to build the PIP package. I have VS2015.
The error is related to zlib at
CMake Error at C:/Projects/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/build/zlib/tmp/zlib-gitclone.cmake:84 (message):
Failed to init submodules in:
'C:/Projects/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/build/zlib/src/zlib'
There are more errors with the same issue (git failed to init submodules) for: highwayhash, and jasoncpp.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
