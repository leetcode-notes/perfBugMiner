Describe the problem
git log shows latest commit is 82456f9fee7c4b5e9beb100e59ba8dc5eb688b28, my python install package file is named tensorflow-1.3.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl, but python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)" output v1.2.0-2651-g82456f9 1.2.1-rc1. I use python help to see some api doc, and find they are same as 1.3.0-rc1  says.
