[PATCH] FreeBSD compatibility

Hi,
I've managed to compile tensorflow in cpu mode so here's whats needed for FreeBSD compatibility.
As I've no clue how bazel really works I've mostly hacked the bazel stuff, so someone that knows what he's doing might want to make the BUILD changes in the proper place :)
Summary

-ldl needs to be removed from all linkopts for FreeBSD as libdl is integrated into libc  so FreeBSD does not have -ldl
No code needs to be changed becides adding a few ifstatements for FreeBSD right next to APPLE statements and adding a missing header file
external/protobuf/BUILD needs "-lm" in LINK_OPTS, I did not figure out how to tell bazel to do that during tar.gz extraction.
