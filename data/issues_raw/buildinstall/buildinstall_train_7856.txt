[Windows] tensorboard - needs to be started from same drive as logdir

OS: Windows 10 (64 bit)
TensorFlow Version: 1.0.0
CUDA: 8.0
GPU: yes
Problem:
C:>tensorboard --logdir=E:\tmp\tensorflow\mnist\logs
=> tensorboard starts without loading data (not working and difficult to detect reason)
E:>tensorboard --logdir=E:\tmp\tensorflow\mnist\logs
=> tensorboard starts with loading data (works perfectly)
