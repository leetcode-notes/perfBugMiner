Installed succesfully, but went wrong and outputed  ‘undefined symbol: zgelsd_’ when testing

Environment info
Operating System: Ubuntu14.04, python3.4.3
I installed tensorflow using pip3 succesfully from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
When I tried to test it using offical test code, it went wrong as follows:
/usr/bin/python3.4 /home/daisy/PycharmProjects/miachaelLiang/test_tensorflow.py
