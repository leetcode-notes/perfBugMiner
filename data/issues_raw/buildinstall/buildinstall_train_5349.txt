Include libcurl into the bazel build

Currently tensorflow serving project will build gcs_file_system target which may fail, with the following message:
ERROR: /home/heliangliang/work/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/cloud/BUILD:49:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/core/platform/cloud:http_request' failed: gcc failed: error executing command /usr/bin/gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' -fstack-protector -Wall -Wl,-z,-relro,-z,now -B/usr/bin -B/usr/bin -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object -fno-canonical-system-headers ...

                              CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0);

The reason is gcs_file_system dependens on libcurl 7.33.0+, and this is higher than the default package versions of many Linux distros.
It's better to include libcurl as bazel build library instead of using the system one.
