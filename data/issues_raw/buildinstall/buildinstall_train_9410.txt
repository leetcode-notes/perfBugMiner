Error Building from Source with CUDA 7.5 in docker.

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support.

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues.
We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing
bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies
thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating
an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
I cloned r1.1 branch, and tried either leave repo as-is or modify WORKSPACE.bzl . Both comes out same error.


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Ubuntu 14.04


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source


TensorFlow version (use command below):r1.1


Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.4.5, compiled from sorce


CUDA/cuDNN version:CUDA 7.5.17 & cuDNNv5 (using nvidia/cuda:7.5-cudnn5-devel-ubuntu14.04


GPU model and memory:GPU is onls


Exact command to reproduce:


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can collect the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print (tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Error when running tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/configured GPU bazel build -c opt --config=cuda tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package .The error message is:

ERROR: /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/68a62076e91007a7908bc42a32e4cff9/external/nccl_archive/BUILD:33:1: error while parsing .d file: /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/68a62076e91007a7908bc42a32e4cff9/execroot/tensorflow/bazel-out/local_linux-opt/bin/external/nccl_archive/_objs/nccl/external/nccl_archive/src/all_reduce.cu.pic.d (No such file or directory). nvcc fatal : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_60'
Note that I compile it in docker and have no Nvidia Pascal GPU, after looing for help on StackOverflow, I think there would be some unsupported configs. So I tried to alternate nccl package url in ./tensorflow/workspace.bzl. But still the issue occurs. I think it might be a bug that tensorflow installer not support CUDA 7.5 well, or should I add any options for nvcc when building with  bazel.

Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files
should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the minimum
necessary to generate the problem.
