Tensorflow v1.2.1 compile error

I'm, trying to build tensorflow from source. I've followed the tutorial in https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources without success.
The only difference is that I'm trying to use OpenCL with SYCL.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits
TensorFlow version to be compiled: v1.2.1
Python version: 2.7.6
Bazel version (from repository): Build label: 0.5.2
GPU model and memory: Radeon HD 7850

Problem
I'm trying to compile tensorflow v1.2.1 but I'm having an error about numpy missing dependecies declaration.
It seems there is some workaround because headers are there, but I have no clue about how to do it. My bazel knowledge is low.
