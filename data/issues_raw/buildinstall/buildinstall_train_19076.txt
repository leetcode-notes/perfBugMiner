why ldd  libtensorflow_cc.so can not find library related to tensorrt ?

I have build tensorflow c++ library from source code of tensorflow1.7-release vision, but when i ldd this so, i can not find any information about tenosrrt, why? And when i configure, i have designated the TRT library's path, and i use bazel to build ,the command is like this:
bazel build --config=cuda --config=monolithic //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so
