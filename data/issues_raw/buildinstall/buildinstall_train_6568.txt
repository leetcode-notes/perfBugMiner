Get rid of setdlopen() in tests

We need to find a new strategy for loading .so files at runtime that depend on other .so files. This is so we can remove the dlopen hack, which is now present in >100 files.
The solution needs to meet the requirement that each .py file fully specifies its dependencies and does not rely on code in __init__.py files to run beforehand. This requirement is necessary in order to maintain the work we've done to: a) remove hourglass imports so affected tests can be calculated better; and b) so Python modules can be loaded lazily like Java.
Background
We've refactored TensorFlow to remove hourglass imports in 5866e06, 58201a0, etc. Since tests no longer depend on the master __init__.py file, we've needed to add code like this to the tops of _test.py files that load custom ops defined by contrib libraries:
import sys

if hasattr(sys, "getdlopenflags") and hasattr(sys, "setdlopenflags"):
  import ctypes
  sys.setdlopenflags(sys.getdlopenflags() | ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)

from google3.third_party.tensorflow.contrib.rnn.python.ops import core_rnn_cell_impl
from google3.third_party.tensorflow.python.framework import ops
...
Otherwise we get errors like undefined symbol: _ZTIN10tensorflow8OpKernelE e.g.
