an API to tell TF ABI

This is a feature request.
TF pip packages might be built with different C++ ABI. The released binaries are built with old ABI. If a user manually compile it with gcc>=5, the default is to use new CXX11 ABI (unless explicitly changed).
As someone who wrote custom ops, this could cause trouble: the op has to be compiled with the same ABI, otherwise there will be issues like #10714 #9137. Therefore the user of my ops would need to be aware of what ABI he's using, and change the flags manually.
I hope there is an API simply tells what ABI should be used when compiling user ops, similar to tf.sysconfig.get_include() which tells what path to include.
