Implement architecture-independent fallback in tensorflow/workspace.bzl

Archictecture-dependent binaries such as nodejs limits portability to different targets (namely, I'm interested in Tensorflow ppc64le builds). I tried replacing x64 binaries with ppc64 in the cached dirs and managed to compile Tensorflow (see #10306).
This issue is similar to bazelbuild/rules_closure#207.
