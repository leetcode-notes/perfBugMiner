No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

Describe the problem
Compile tensorflow in fastbuild mode( release mode,but without any optimization) failed.
Source code / logs
848123e is a dirty hack for this problem.  First,  you shouldn't simply remove the double type kernel in Windows Debug build, it will make some unitests fail.   Second, this fix doesn't fit for the "fastbuild" mode, as "_DEBUG" is not defined.
The root cause is VC cannot eliminate the dead code which is introduced by std::is_same. This problem also exists in tensorflow/core/kernels/depthtospace_op.cc and tensorflow/core/kernels/spacetodepth_op.cc.
