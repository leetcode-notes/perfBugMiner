[Installing TensorFlow offline] $ ./configure fails because no Internet connection is available for my server.

My environment without Internet
My server can't access the Internet because my company's firewall blocks any external network or the Internet. To install Tensorflow on this server, I have to install TensorFlow offline. In other words, I have to correct tens of errors by myself. Upon this error, I had to submit an issue.
I moved the template below because it's way too long. (I filled in some information.) I'd appreciate your feedback.
Questions
My question nails down to two core questions.
Q1. How can I manually fetch all the packages for tensorflow without using bazel command?
I took a closer look at the "configure" file and the following line causes the problem.
$bazel fetch //tensorflow/...
  This bazel command fetches all the packages in target "tensorflow". 
   No Internet connection in my server, so this command fails!. 
   I'll have to download all these packages in ANOTHER computer with Internet connection and   
   move them to my server.

   In another computer with Internet connection, how can I download them without bazel command? Alternative commands can be wget, git, apt-get, pip and so on.

Q2. Where should I place the downloaded packages?
Say all the packages for target "tensorflow" are downloaded.
Where should I place them to run the next command successfully?
 $ bazel build -c opt -config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

I'll have to move all the package to my server from another computer.

So I need some information about the directory that the above command refers to.
(This is all because of the security measure in my company. As a matter of fact, this process is more complex than using another computer, but this gives you an idea about my installation environment without the Internet)

Environment info


Operating System: Ubuntu Linux 14.04


NO INTERNET CONNECTION.
My company's firewall blocks my server from the Internet connection.  So no Internet connection is available. A comment in Issue #5029 says "Long story short, [...] a network access is required.", but a network access on this server is not an option. I'll have to download necessary packages from another computer with Internet connection and upload them to my server via sftp.


CUDA & cuDNN are installed in ~/local/ because of the system admin asked me to do so.
When I run " $ ./configure", CUDA & cuDNN installation was done manually.
