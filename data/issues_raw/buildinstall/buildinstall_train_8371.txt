Problem with missing kernel registration in contrib/makefile build

Problem with missing kernel registration in contrib/makefile build
When reading a graph (through saved_model) I get the error message:
Status: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'TruncatedNormal' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:

when trying to link the application using the tensorflow-core library generated in tensorflow/contrib/makefile
When using bazel, the same application runs without errors.
I have verified that the file "tensorflow/core/ops/random_ops.cc" containing the operation is already present in "tf_op_files.txt".
The library is linked with -all_load option.
Environment info
The tensorflow version used is branch r1.0 on macOS 10.12.3 (no CUDA support). Hash e895d5c
Bazel Version is 0.4.4
