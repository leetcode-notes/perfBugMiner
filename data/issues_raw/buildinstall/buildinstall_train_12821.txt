Wrong error message during compiling

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Amazon Linux 2017.03
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): release v1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 7.5/cuDNN 5.1.10
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80
Exact command to reproduce: remove patch command and try to compile

Describe the problem
There's a wrong error message when you try to compile TensorFlow without patch command installed. It's not a big deal but could take a couple of hours to figure it out.
