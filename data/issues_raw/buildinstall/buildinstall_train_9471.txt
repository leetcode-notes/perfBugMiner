Time cost for each training step increases with the training procedure

When I try to run a SRGAN network by 32 images with 96 * 96 size, each training step the time cost increases. At the beginning, each step cost 35 seconds, but when 160 steps later, the time cost increases to more than 200 seconds. By checking the time log, I can see it do increase with the training step. If I save the model and restart training process, the time cost reduces to about 35 seconds and start increasing again.
