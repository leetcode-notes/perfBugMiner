Anaconda's release is now 3.6 and it breaks the install

I am trying to install tensorflow on windows 10 Enterprise Edition.
I followed the instructions to download Anaconda, but the web-site has been upgraded to Python 3.6.
I tried to download a new whl from the nightly build but it does not work with the latest Anaconda release.
I get:
C:>pip install --upgrade C:\Temp\tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Any plans to upgrade tensorflow to the latest version of Anaconda Python?
