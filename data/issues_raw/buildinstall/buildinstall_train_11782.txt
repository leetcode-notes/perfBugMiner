CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED when using conv2d/max_pool on Tensorflow GPU (Windows 10)

When using conv2d and/or max_pool, the error below shows and stops the code. I used the code available here: https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
I have searched through all websites including GitHub and StackOverflow, and these two are the most relevant results and why they did not help:

#6783 - The issue pertains to tf.one_hot. Is this function used in either one of the functions above? The issue seems to be not solved too. I tried using the code on a Linux/GPU and on a Windows/CPU setting as well and it worked.
dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf#90 - They kind of 'resolved' the issue by reducing the batch size. I tried this and it worked, but it does not make sense. For one thing, I tried using the code on another Windows machine with an older GPU and it works well.
