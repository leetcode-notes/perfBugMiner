Describe the problem
I am trying to run the tensorflow to onnx converter (https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) and for that reason I had to use some outdated versions of tf and onnx. I finally managed to get everything installed correctly, when I try to run any example I get the message that there is no module named tensorflow
I checked this previous issue from last year and from what I understood, tf tools weren't supported on Windows. Is that still the case? Is there any workaround?
