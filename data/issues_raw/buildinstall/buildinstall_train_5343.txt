ImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I have installed cuda 7.5, not 8, but when I get this error when I try to import tensflow (having installed ts binaries for 7.5, gpu, linux).  I have tried un- and re-installing everything repeatedly.  I may have at one time attempted to install cuda 8 in the past, but 7.5 is in my $path.
the complete error:
