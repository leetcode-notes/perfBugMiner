System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10 Pro Version 1607 amd64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Install via native pip or anaconda via:

conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5


TensorFlow version (use command below):
As described in the get started page:

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

1: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

Describe the problem
Source code / logs
On running the pip install command, the classic "... wheel is not supported" error comes up:
PS C:\Users\user> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

Using the cmd, everything works just fine and i think, that a lot of people are having this problem out there right now, imho the install doc page must be updated to contain some warnings about this.
Oh and by the way: tensorflow is fucking amazing!
