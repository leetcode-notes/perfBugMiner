[windows 7] Not using CUDA. No errors or messages indicating dlls have been loaded in log.

Issue: after upgrading from 0.12 to 1.0.1, I lost GPU support. On 0.12, there were log entries indicating successful loading of cuda/cudnn dlls and log entries if dlls weren't found. On 1.0.1, I don't see any log entries when importing tensorflow, but GPU is no longer listed amongst available devices.
Can't provide much useful information without anything in the logs. Has logging been disabled, or is it getting written to a file now? How can I diagnose this?

Operating System: windows 7
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 8.0 cuDNN 6.0
Output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". 1.0.1
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
Reinstalled tf, reinstalled cudnn
