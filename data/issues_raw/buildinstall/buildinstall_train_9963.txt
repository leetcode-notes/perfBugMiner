configure script overrides user's bazelrc

The ./configure script will write to a .bazelrc file in the cwd to save some of it's options (in particular, jemalloc). Unfortunately this has the effect of overriding ~/.bazelrc. This is undocumented, and probably should not happen. For now, the solution is copy your own bazelrc into the tensorflow root before configuring - fortunately ./configure will not overwrite it and only append to it.
