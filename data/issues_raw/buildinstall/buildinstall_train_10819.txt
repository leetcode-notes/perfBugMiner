Tensorflow Android API version 1.2 not in JCenter

The freshly released version 1.2 of the tensorflow APIs is not yet fully available in JCenter ( https://bintray.com/google/tensorflow/tensorflow-android/1.2.0). There is a version 1.2.0 but it does not contain any files.
Can you push these files to the repository?
