TensorFlow r1.4 does not be compiled from 32bit environment.

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): None
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Slackware 14.2 32bit
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): r1.4
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce: bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package and set optimization flags to -march=i686

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
Installing TensorFlow r1.4 on a Linux system with 32bit kernel does not work. I think the error comes from the configuration of the nsync, which does not care 32bit environment.
I googled it, and found a workaround.
https://lengerrong.blogspot.kr/2017/09/fix-up-configurable-attribute-copts.html
and added
"//conditions"default": []'
to the appropriate place.
However, I think that it will be much better if the official configure system of the TensorFlow supports the 32bit system.
Thanks.
Sungjin.
