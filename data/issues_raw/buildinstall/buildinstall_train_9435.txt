Tensorflow Error - no such package '@local_config_cuda//cuda'

So I'm trying to run the image retraining official tensorflow tutorial from this link: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining
I need to get it working for my dissertation with my own images in less than a month so it's extremely urgent.
Once I get to the line "bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain"
I get this output:
"ERROR: error loading package 'tensorflow/examples/image_retraining': Encountered error while reading extension file 'cuda/build_defs.bzl': no such package '@local_config_cuda//cuda': error loading package 'external': The repository named 'local_config_cuda' could not be resolved."
This thread seems to be the same issue, but no solutions offered: #5805
This thread has more activity but it's talking about '@local_config_cuda//crosstool' rather than '@local_config_cuda/cuda/' so may not be helpful for me: #4105
I'm using Linux Mint.
Here is my tf_env.txt file for details about my system: tf_env.txt
Let me know if there's any other details I should add which could be useful.
I used this page for installation: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
So CUDAÂ® Toolkit 8.0.
cuDNN v5.1
virtualenv install of Tensorflow
Trying to run python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
says "Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime."
but I can get other simple Tensorflow stuff to work so not sure why that is.
