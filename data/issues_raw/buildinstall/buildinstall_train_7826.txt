bazel error

Hello everyone,

As I am having an error "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'GRUCell'" when tried to run transate.py i removed tensorflow from my system and started installing it again from sources. I installed bazel and configured the installation. After "Build the pip package", I am getting the following error.
System specifications:
I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on vmware with 2 GB RAM and 100 GB disk space
Can anyone please help me in resolving these errors
Thanks in advance
