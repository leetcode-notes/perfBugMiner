You have bazel  installed.
Please upgrade your bazel installation to version 0.4.5 or higher to build TensorFlow!
Exiting...

The reason is Bazel@HEAD doesn't generate a version number, the new way of version check introduced in 88d648f fails.
Maybe skip the check if the version number is empty? Because this also means users cannot use their custom bazel to build TF unless they add --embed_label ${version_number} as a build option.
