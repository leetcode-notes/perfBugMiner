Unsound GPU driver version scheme assumption in StringToDriverVersion

Tensorflow's cuda_diagnostics.cc here assumes that the GPU driver version will match %d.%d.%d but that doesn't seem to be a safe assumption.
2017-05-04 09:48:39.543664: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_diagnostics.cc:189] libcuda reported version is: Invalid argument: expected %d.%d or %d.%d.%d form for driver version; got "378.05.05.05"

In FindDsoVersion(), TF is parsing the name of the loaded libcuda library to get the version number, and the current Nvidia web driver library is:
/Library/Frameworks/CUDA.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libcuda_378.05.05.05_mercury.dylib
