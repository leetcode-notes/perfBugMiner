Attempt to "import tensorflow as tf" on MacOS 10.10.5, Python 2.7.10, numpy 1.12.0

Installed tensorflow using pip on MacOS Yosemite 10.10.5, running Python 2.7.10, with current numpy 1.12.0.  Python runs ok, but attempt to "import tensorflow as tf", as per the documentation for TensorFlow install on Mac OS, generates exactly the same error sequence as posted already on github by another user.  The other users posting was closed without comment.  The specific error message is:
AttributeError: type object 'NewBase' has no attribute 'is_abstract'
The url of the other user, which documented the traceback (which is essentially same as I am getting) is:
#5707

If I can resolve or workaround this, I will post the fix here.
