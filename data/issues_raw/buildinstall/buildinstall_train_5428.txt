My server cannot connect to the Internet, when I ./configure, it will download package from Internet, of course this will fail. So I download the package manually.
E.G.
ERROR: package contains errors: tensorflow/core/debug. ERROR: error loading package 'tensorflow/core/debug': Encountered error while reading extension file 'protobuf.bzl': no such package '@protobuf//': Error downloading from http://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/008b5a228b37c054f46ba478ccafa5e855cb16db.tar.gz to /mnt/a/usr/75c879a7665c1f6bb168362b3b0eb86b/external/protobuf: Error downloading http://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/008b5a228b37c054f46ba478ccafa5e855cb16db.tar.gz to /mnt/a/usr/75c879a7665c1f6bb168362b3b0eb86b/external/protobuf/008b5a228b37c054f46ba478ccafa5e855cb16db.tar.gz: Failed to connect to http://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/008b5a228b37c054f46ba478ccafa5e855cb16db.tar.gz : github.com.
I download the protobuf-008b5a228b37c054f46ba478ccafa5e855cb16db.tar.gz and move it under /mnt/a/usr/75c879a7665c1f6bb168362b3b0eb86b/external/protobuf/, but it still fails. It seems the ./configure will ignore the local package
Anyway to solve this...? It's troubling to install tensorflow on the NFS without Internet.
