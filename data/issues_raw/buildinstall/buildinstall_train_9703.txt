pkg-config file generation

Hi! I was wondering if a pkg-config file for the tensorflow library (libtensorflow.so) could be added so that depending projects could use it more easily.
For the current stable version (1.1.0), if we installed it into /usr (which should be configurable), the generated pkg-config file tensorflow.pc should look something like:
prefix=/usr
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include
modules=1

Name: tensorflow
Version: 1.1.0
Description: Library for computation using data flow graphs for scalable machine learning
Requires:
Libs: -L${libdir} -ltensorflow -lstdc++
Cflags: -I${includedir}/tensorflow

Thanks in advance :)
