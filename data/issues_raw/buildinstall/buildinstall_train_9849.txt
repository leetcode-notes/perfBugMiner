One thing to notice is that with my experiments,
The changes in
Fix TensorFlow compilation errors with KNL optimization flags
fixed the building issue. Although I don't know whether it is functioning correctly.
Then the code is rolled back in
FIxed merge issues 
Could you please look into this.
Thank you.
