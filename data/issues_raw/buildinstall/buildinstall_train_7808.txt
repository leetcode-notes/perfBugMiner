TensorFlow builds LLVM even if ./configured without XLA

At HEAD (4ac9c09), if I configure TensorFlow without XLA support and run
blaze build //tensorflow/...

it still builds both XLA and LLVM (or at least parts, since I haven't waited for it to finish).  Needless to say, it also downloads LLVM, which ideally would not be necessary without XLA support.
Is it possible to skip building a compiler if I don't want XLA?
