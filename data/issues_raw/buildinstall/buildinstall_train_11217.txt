tools.compatibility module is missing or not installed properly through pip

Running tf_upgrade.py gets ImportError:
$ python tf_upgrade.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tf_upgrade.py", line 23, in <module>
    from tensorflow.tools.compatibility import ast_edits
ImportError: No module named compatibility


There's no subdir named compatibility under tools in python packages dir. Those were taken from:
>>> import site; site.getsitepackages()
['/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages']
