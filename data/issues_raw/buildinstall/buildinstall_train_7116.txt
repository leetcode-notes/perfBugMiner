Packet16q16i does not name a type

When I compile from source using the flag of AVX512 on Xeon Phi with gcc, I come across a problem as below:
ERROR: tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:895:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/core/kernels:gather_functor' failed: gcc failed: error executing command /opt/rh/devtoolset-4/root/usr/bin/gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' -fstack-protector -Wall -Wl,-z,-relro,-z,now -B/opt/rh/devtoolset-4/root/usr/bin -B/usr/bin -Wunused-but-set-parameter ...

typedef Packet16q16i half;
Is it caused by some code missing? I add some code in the file PacketMathAVX512.h:
typedef struct Packet16q16i {
__m512i val;
operator __m512i() const { return val; }
Packet16q16i();
Packet16q16i(__m512i val) : val(val) {}
} Packet16q16i;
However, it is still failed with the following issue:
ERROR: tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:346:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/core/kernels:split_lib' failed: gcc failed: error executing command
external/eigen_archive/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/../../../Eigen/src/Core/GenericPacketMath.h:478:16: error: 'alignment' is not a member of 'Eigen::internal::unpacket_traitsEigen::internal::Packet64q8u'
if(Alignment >= unpacket_traits::alignment)
^
I am not sure if I did something wrong. Can someone help?
I use the command provided in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4775
bazel build --ignore_unsupported_sandboxing -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package  --copt "-mavx512f" --copt "-mavx512cd" --copt "-mavx512er" --copt "-mavx512pf" --copt "-mavx2" --copt "-fopt-info-vec-all" --copt "-DEIGEN_ENABLE_AVX512" --copt "-DEIGEN_ENABLE_AVX2"  --verbose_failures   -j 64
The gcc version is 5.3.
BTW, I also tried to use Intel compiler to compile the code, but failed. I saw two issues are discussed, but it seems that there is no solution.
