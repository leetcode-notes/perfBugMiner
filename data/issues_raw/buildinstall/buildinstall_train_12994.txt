Steps in getting started guide are incorrect.

Hi, would appreciate if someone can help me get started. It must be something very trivial, but as a beginner, I did not find an answer anywhere. Looking for help.


I had to refer to stack overflow for basic installation on windows - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38896424/tensorflow-not-found-in-pip


Even after that I get error as below (just trying import tensorflow as tf)-


Traceback (most recent call last):

Error importing tensorflow.  Unless you are using bazel,
you should not try to import tensorflow from its source directory;
please exit the tensorflow source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter
from there.

This is same as #1402, which is closed and I could not find a solution anywhere.
Please let me know if more information is needed, I am looking forward to get started successfully and learn tensor flow.
System information

import tensorflow as tf
**windows 10
binary:
command below doesn't work, downloaded the latest version just now.:
Python version 3.6.3:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version -- no idea:
GPU model and memory - NA, 32GB TAM:
Exact command to reproduce -- import tensorflow as tf:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
~~above command does not work and gives the same error.
