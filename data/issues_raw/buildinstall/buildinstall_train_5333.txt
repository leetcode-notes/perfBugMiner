Problem compiling tensorflow for iOS on Sierra/Xcode 8

with xcode-select pointed to Xcode 8:
$ xcode-select -p
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

I get the following compile error with build_all_ios.sh on Sierra:
checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error: in `/Users/serkan/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf':
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
See `config.log' for more details

Not sure if this is related to Xcode 8 or to code signing on Sierra
