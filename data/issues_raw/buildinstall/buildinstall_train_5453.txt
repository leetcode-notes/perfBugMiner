tensorflow/core/util/event.proto: File not found while building with custom C++ project

I'm building tensorflow inside a C++ project and link with it using bazel build script. I'm using the master version of tensorflow and here a the BUILD file
cc_library(
    name = "tf-net",
    hdrs = ["model.h"],
    srcs = [
        "model.cc",
    ],
    linkopts = ["-lm"],
    deps = [
        "@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/core:core_cpu",
        "@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/core:lib",
        "@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/core:tensorflow"
    ],
	visibility=["//visibility:public"]
)

This worked for previous version of tensorflow but now I get
tensorflow/core/util/event.proto: File not found.
tensorflow/core/debug/debug_service.proto: Import "tensorflow/core/util/event.proto" was not found or had errors.
tensorflow/core/debug/debug_service.proto:38:25: "Event" is not defined.

It seems that it tries to compile the proto file debug_service.proto but can't find the needed dependencies.
