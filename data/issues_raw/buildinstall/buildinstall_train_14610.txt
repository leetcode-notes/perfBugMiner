Error when bazel building after pull down newest master branch

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version:  8.0.61
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1b06
Exact command to reproduce:

bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:freeze_graph

Describe the problem
Here is the warning and error message I got :
WARNING: tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1801:1: in includes attribute of cc_library rule //tensorflow/core:framework_headers_lib: '../../external/nsync/public' resolves to 'external/nsync/public' not below the relative path of its package 'tensorflow/core'. This will be an error in the future. Since this rule was created by the macro 'cc_header_only_library', the error might have been caused by the macro implementation in tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl:1108:30
