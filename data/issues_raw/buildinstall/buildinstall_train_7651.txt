Existing issues
Already found issues: #5344 and #5319 but neither provides a solution to the problem - that I could see (perhaps I just missed it somewhere)
Environment info
Operating System: Linux Mint 17.3 Rosa
Reproduction details
First I built tensorflow from git source, branch r1.0.
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow (push)
$ git branch
  master
* r1.0
$ bazel version
Build label: 0.4.4
Build target: bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/BazelServer_deploy.jar
Build time: Wed Feb 1 18:54:21 2017 (1485975261)
Build timestamp: 1485975261
Build timestamp as int: 1485975261

No apparent problems encountered during the build.  This resulted in a .whl file in the /tmp directory and I installed it with pip:
$ sudo pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

At this point I get the import error shown at the top of this post whenever import tensorflow is used in a python shell.
So I removed the locally built tensorflow with sudo pip uninstall tensorflow and re-installed with the pre-built .whl file:
$ sudo pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

Same import error.  Uninstalled again and tried using a virtualenv.  But I'm still getting the import errors:
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/usr/tf
$ source ~/usr/tf/bin/activate
(tf)$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

I've tried the following, but neither had any effect:
 pip install --upgrade protobuf
 pip install --upgrade tensorflow

My best guess is that the python protobuf lib version available for the older version of Linux Mint I'm using is the problem.  But I don't know how to verify that or fix it - if that is indeed the problem.
