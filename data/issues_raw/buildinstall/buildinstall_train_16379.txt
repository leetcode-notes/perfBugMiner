No module named 'tensorflow'. Anaconda+windows10+tensorflow-gpu+cuda8+cudnn6

I had anaconda on my windows 10.
I installed CUDA 8.0 with cuDNN 6 and then followed http://blog.nitishmutha.com/tensorflow/2017/01/22/TensorFlow-with-gpu-for-windows.html to activate tensorflow-gpu environment. Now when I import tensorflow in the console, it works but with jupyter notebook opened right in this environment it throws the error. I even upgraded setuptools as mentioned in a previous issue.
