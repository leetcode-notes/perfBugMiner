Cannot build on a non-internet connected machine

I'm trying to build tensorflow on a machine that has no internet connection.  I've downloaded the
latest bazel (.0.4.4)  and installed and then run the configure script.  I downloaded the git repo with
git clone --recurse-submodues https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
The configure then fails with:
This then fails with:
INFO: Unknown host: bazel-mirror.storage.googleapis.com
ERROR: com.google.devtools.build.lib.packages.BuildFileContainsErrorsException: error loading package '': Encountered error while reading extension file 'closure/defs.bzl': no such package '@io_bazel_rules_closure//closure': Error downloading [http://bazel-mirror.storage.googleapis.com/github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/archive/5ca1dab6df9ad02050f7ba4e816407f88690cf7d.tar.gz, https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/archive/5ca1dab6df9ad02050f7ba4e816407f88690cf7d.tar.gz] to /tmp/steven/.cache/bazel/_bazel_kelso/03aa5bcd96ce8a24592d7d0f1cdaf43b/external/io_bazel_rules_closure/5ca1dab6df9ad02050f7ba4e816407f88690cf7d.tar.gz: All mirrors are down: [Unknown host: bazel-mirror.storage.googleapis.com, Unknown host: github.com].
This is to be expected as the machine is on a private network.
However, I can manually install tarbalss of packages etc on this box, but I can't work out where they should be installed within the source tree.
Is this possible, or can tensorflow only be built with an active connection to the internet?
Many thanks,
S.
