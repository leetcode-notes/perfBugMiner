Some example .py files missing from pip-installed TensorFlow source tree

I'm working through TensorFlow's the RNN tutorial. Navigating to the tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb directory, I should see reader.py and ptb_word_lm.py, but I only see reader.py (alongside __init__.py etc).
I've tried both the install using https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl, and the default pip installation; they don't differ in this regard.
I wonder if this is related to #5014, which also deals with missing files. Everything seems to work correctly, as far as I can tell â€” it's just that some of these examples are missing from the source tree.
