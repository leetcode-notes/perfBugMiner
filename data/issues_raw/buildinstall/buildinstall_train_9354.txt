Error: tensorflow/core/framework/resource_handle.pb.h file not found

I have followed following instructions from this link: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile


Before you start (All Platforms)


Building on iOS


Copy files from inception to data folders in benchmark, simple and camera project.


Building by hand. (error in terminal: failed with exit code 1) in both compile_ios_protobuf and run make file.


download_dependencies.sh worked successfully.


If I open project from Simple or camera folder, I received the error:
tensorflow/core/framework/resource_handle.pb.h file not found.

indicates that the problem is related to macOS Sierra. after that I installed the update from AppStore.
After that I updated macOS update which updated command line tools and now I receive following errors by running all things from scratch. (Delete old project, unzip new project and follow all instructions).
