Issue Linking of rule '//tensorflow/python:_pywrap_tensorflow.so' failed while building

I have added a new Op kernel in "user_ops" folder of "tensorflow" source directory. I have also written a test to verify if the Op is successfully implemented. But while building and testing my Op kernel using the command, "bazel test //tensorflow/user_ops:xxxx_test", I am getting the following error:
Linking of rule '//tensorflow/python:_pywrap_tensorflow.so' failed: gcc failed: error executing command /usr/bin/gcc -shared -o bazel-out/local-py3-fastbuild/bin/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so -Wl,--version-script tensorflow/tf_version_script.lds -pthread -Wl,-no-as-needed -B/usr/bin -B/usr/bin ... (remaining 9 argument(s) skipped): com.google.devtools.build.lib.shell.BadExitStatusException: Process exited with status 1.
I am unable to build and test my new Op kernel. Please help in resolving this issue as I am blocked because of this error.
