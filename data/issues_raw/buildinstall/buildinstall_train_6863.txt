Protobuf import issue

I am trying to run tensorboard but I am getting the following import error on mac osx;
AttributeError: module 'pkg_resources' has no attribute 'declare_namespace'
I have tried reinstalling setuptools and distribute. This is coming up as an error in python 3.5 even though my tensorflow is installed in 2.7; I.e.
 File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/tensorboard", line 7, in <module>
    from tensorflow.tensorboard.tensorboard import main
