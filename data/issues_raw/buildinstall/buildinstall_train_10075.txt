Missing includes in whl-file (cmake)

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 x64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): latest master
Bazel version (if compiling from source): CMAKE
Exact command to reproduce: MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj

Describe the problem

Using the cmake build command results in the successfull build of the file:
tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_python\dist\tensorflow_gpu-1.1.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
In the whl-file, the header files (obtained via setup.py) are missing.
The header files should be included in the whl file if I am not mistaken. I am not sure what the origin of the missing files is.

Source code / logs
The desired header files can be manually installed by calling
python tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_python\setup.py install_headers
