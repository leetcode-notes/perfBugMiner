Tensorflow pypi packages not found from TravisCI

I am experiencing trouble installing tensorflow from TravisCI. As tensorflow 0.12.0rc0 is on pypi a simple
pip install tensorflow

should install tensorflow (CPU). Yet, although this works locally, it does not work on Travis with the following error:
Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement tensorflow==0.12.0rc0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
  No distributions at all found for tensorflow==0.12.0rc0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))

According to this scipy issue, it could be a problem with the packages that are being uploaded to pypi. In particular, there is a cp27mu-manylinux version for python 2.7 and cp34m-manylinux versions for python 3.4 (and also 3.5). The above issue seems to suggest that the "mu" versions would be used for python3 and the "m" versions for 2.7.
Other packages solve this problem by installing tensorflow from the URL. Given that tensorflow is now on pypi, the failure to import it from travis seems to point to a bug in your build system.
