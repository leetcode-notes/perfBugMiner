Minimum Cuda capability is 3.5? But, 3.0 stated on site

I'm able to run the hello world examples, but the following warning (or error) is printed. So, I can't make use of my gpu? While this maybe a simple correction on the web page, is there anyway I can get a version that allows me to run with a Cuda 3.0 card?
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
GPU: K2000M
On the linux installation page, the minimum capability is written as 3.0. But, when I try to run hello world on a cuda 3.0 card, the following is printed:
