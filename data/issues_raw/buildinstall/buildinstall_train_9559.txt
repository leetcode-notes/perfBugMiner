no such package 'tensorflow/examples/image_retraining': BUILD file not found on package path.

Describe the problem
I use ubuntu, and install anaconda3 and tensorflow followed the instruction. After it, I am trying to learn how to retrain a model that follows the inception tutorial. It seems that I got the following errors
ERROR: no such package 'tensorflow/examples/image_retraining': BUILD file not found on package path.
Is there a way to solve this issue?
