Update protobuf.cmake to 3.2.0?

Hello,
The protobuf.cmake is building an old version of protobuf, one which specifically does not include the parsing limit bump from 64MB to 2GB (referenced in #582 and resolved by #7338). It is currently building a fork which contains a specific MSVC fix; this fix has been merged into the main protobuf repository and is included in 3.2.0.
Is it possible to align the repository and tree used by protobuf.cmake to that used by workspace.bzl? I'm happy to submit a PR.
Cheers.
