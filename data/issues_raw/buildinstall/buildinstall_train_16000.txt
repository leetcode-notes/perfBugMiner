TensorFlow Installation Error on SLES 11 SP Linux

I have been trying to install tensorflow (1.3.0/1.4/1.4.1) on SLES 11 Linux, I was getting GLIBC_2.14 not found an exception, currently, we have the GLIBC_2.11.3 version in SLES 11 SP3T.
Please help me to install any of tensorflow > 0.8 versions on SLES 11 Linux and let me know the tensorflow compatible version for SLES 11. OR SLES 11 SP3 Linux is not compatible with TensorFlow any of the versions.
Thanks in Advance.
