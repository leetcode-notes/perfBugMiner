(iOS Camera Example from GitHub) 'unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor' file not found

I have just downloaded the tensorflow iOS Camera Example from GitHub and when I run the project it crashes with the error "'unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor' file not found".  I have added an example and would really like some help as soon as possible. 
All the best, James
