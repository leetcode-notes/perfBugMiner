Tensorflow - No valid folders of images found at XXXXX

So I have a semi custom code written for a new biomedical program that I am developing. I am trying to get my model to begin retraining and I am getting this problem out of nowhere whenever I run
python retrain.py 
--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks
--how_many_training_steps=100
--model_dir=/tf_files/ inception 
--output_graph=/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb 
--output_labels=/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt 
--image_dir /tf_files/ct
The 'ct' folder in question and giving me issues and has a stockpile of images. I have made sure that the folder does not have any other files in it, creating the issue of tensor not picking up the image first. Furthermore, I have ensured that each file has been converted to a jpg. I have no hyphens or dashes in the subfolders and they are all lowercased/ no spaces.
Below are the following inputs that are giving me troubles. I have scoured the net for different answers to this problem and after troubleshooting the above mentioned attributes I still am finding the same error message incur. Thanks in advance.
