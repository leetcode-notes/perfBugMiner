Self-contained source code package of tensorflow

Dear TensorFlow development team,
Government regularization on medical software requires software to be compiled from fully controllable source code. Downloading from outside of the manufacture is not permitted. This literally implies that medical software should be able to compile without Internet connection. Currently, the bazel compilation procedure download from Internet. We post this request for a self-contained package of tensorflow.
