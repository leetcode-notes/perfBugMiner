bazel build failure of current master in Docker container due to contrib/lite

Building current GPU version of master branch 31b79e4 fails in Docker container, saying
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libcuda.so.1, needed by bazel-out/host/bin/_solib_local/_U_S_Stensorflow_Scc_Cops_Sdata_Uflow_Uops_Ugen_Ucc___Utensorflow/libtensorflow_framework.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)

and I find that it is due to contrib/lite: when I comment out the related dependencies in tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD, the build success.
I know this error is typically solved when I create a soft link inside the container before to build (c.f. #10776):
RUN ln -s /usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs/libcuda.so /usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs/libcuda.so.1

but this time, it doesn't help.
