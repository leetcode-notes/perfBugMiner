Describe the problem
I am following Pete Warden's TensorFlow for Mobile Poets guide and seem to have a found an error. When I run "tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh" after about 20 minutes it returns an error.
I have tried running lipo -info /Users/ryan/Downloads/tensorflow2/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf_ios/lib/libprotobuf.a
and this returns:
Architectures in the fat file:
/Users/ryan/Downloads/tensorflow2/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen/protobuf_ios/lib/libprotobuf.a are: i386
I have the entire error script here:
