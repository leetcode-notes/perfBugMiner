iOS - No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'ExtractImagePatches' with these attrs

Hi everyone,
I am trying to load a graph inside iOS that was generated by another software into a .pb file.  It was tested on a Ubuntu machine, so I know the model works correctly.
When trying to use it with iOS, the project builds correctly and then I have the following error:
Could not create TensorFlow Graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'ExtractImagePatches' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
  <no registered kernels>

	 [[Node: ExtractImagePatches = ExtractImagePatches[T=DT_FLOAT, ksizes=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding="VALID", rates=[1, 1, 1, 1], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1]](concat)]]

I know other issues have been posted related to this; however I was unable to locate a solution.
I am using TensorFlow 1.0.1 and Python 3.6.0
I can run the iOS examples with no problem.
iOS seems not to be able to find ExtractImagePatches Op.
If anyone could help with this issue, it would be greatly appreciated.
