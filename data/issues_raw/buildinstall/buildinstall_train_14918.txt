Describe the problem
I am trying to run unit tests following the instructions here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-unit-tests
I have installed Docker and am running:
sudo tensorflow/tools/ci_build/ci_build.sh CPU bazel test //tensorflow/...
I receive the following error:
ERROR: /home/jovarty/git/tensorflow/bazel-ci_build-cache/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/eab0d61a99b6696edb3d2aff87b585e8/external/bazel_tools/tools/android/BUILD:230:1: Executing genrule @bazel_tools//tools/android:no_android_sdk_repository_error failed (Exit 1): bash failed: error executing command

After this error I see that no tests were run: Executed 0 out of 1666 tests: 1666 were skipped.
Is the Android SDK required when running unit tests? Is this something that should be included in the Dockerfile? (I'm not very familiar with Docker)
