Issue with installing TensorFlow with pip

Hi!
I'm using Python 3.6.3
I'm trying to install TensorFlow using:
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
I get the following error:
Collecting tensorflow
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versi
ons: )
No matching distribution found for tensorflow
Could someone help to fix this?
