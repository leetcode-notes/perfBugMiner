Import Tensorflow lib with Qt for Android

I tried to import tensorflow lib into my Qt project, the build procedure was followed as described in contrib/makefile
I somehow managed with Desktop and iOS platforms, but failed with Android with linking problem:
/Users/chen/Documents/Git/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/gen_android/protobuf/lib/libprotobuf.a(strutil.o):strutil.cc:function google::protobuf::safe_strtof(char const*, float*): error: undefined reference to 'strtof'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [libCrossDemo.so] Error 1
20:22:40: The process "/usr/bin/make" exited with code 2.
Error while building/deploying project CrossDemo (kit: Android for armeabi-v7a (GCC 4.9, Qt 5.8.0))

I think this problem is because I did not reference to the std lib correctly. Could someone help me with this problem? thank you.
