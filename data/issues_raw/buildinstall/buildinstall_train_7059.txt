Issue to compile on macOS with unrecognized command line option

Hello,
I do have issues to compile Tensorflow on my mac in order to use the Java version. Here some useful information about my environment:

macOS 10.12.3
gcc 6.3.0 (from MacPorts)
Bazel 4.3.0
Python 2.7
Tensorflow commit a12c7dc
CPU only

Once I have done the ./configure I'm trying to compile the Java version and here the log I get:
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/java:tensorflow //tensorflow/java:libtensorflow_jni
INFO: Found 2 targets...
ERROR: /private/var/tmp/_bazel_jplu/00c84c0db16fb633b58c75ed37aef199/external/nanopb_git/BUILD:8:1: C++ compilation of rule '@nanopb_git//:nanopb' failed: cc_wrapper.sh failed: error executing command external/local_config_cc/cc_wrapper.sh -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' -fstack-protector -Wall -Wthread-safety -Wself-assign -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object ...

gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-Wself-assign'; did you mean '-Wparam-assign'?

I also tried with a GCC 5.4 version and I get the exact same error.
Did anyone have an idea of what is going wrong? Am I using a wrong version of GCC?
Thanks in advance.
