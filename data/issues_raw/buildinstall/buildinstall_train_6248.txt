Configure fails when run non-interactively

Running ./configure non-interactively fails for 0.12.0-rc0, and it worked on previous releases.  We're relying on this for the TensorFlow Rust bindings and expect it to configure with default options.  configure seems to be failing on a 'read -p', probably because of 'set -e' being added.
