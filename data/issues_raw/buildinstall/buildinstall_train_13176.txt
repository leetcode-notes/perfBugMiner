Raspberry Pi Makefile issues with proto_text

System information

Raspberry Pi on Ubuntu Mate 16.04 (Also tried Raspbian Stretch but GUI would freeze a lot and still gave similar errors):

Describe the problem
Building tensorflow from source using makefile using the code provided at: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile. I've included two log files in which i ran the initial setup and ran into a zlib.h error which i resolved by running 'sudo apt-get install libz-dev' but then re-run the last make-f line which gave me another error.
Error:

What I've tried
Looked at similar issues but they were related to iOS and didn't make sense to me.
