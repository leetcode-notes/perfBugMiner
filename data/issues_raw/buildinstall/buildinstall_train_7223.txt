OS/X doesn't compile Tensorflow

Not sure of the exact circumstances of this, but I get an undefined symbol when trying to load the _pywrap_tensorflow.so.
The symbol is __cpu_model.
There is a discussion here about it: numpy/numpy#8530
It seems that the file crc32c_accelerate.cc calls the compiler function __builtin_cpu_supports.  While there is a test for the presence of this at the top of the file, there might be a bug in llvm/clang where this function references a symbol called __cpu_model, which isn't compiled into the final .so file.
As a test, I compiled:
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
  if (__builtin_cpu_supports("sse4.2")) {
    puts("a");
  }
}

and I received:
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "___cpu_model", referenced from:
      _main in t-2e30e2.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64

My version of clang is:
Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
