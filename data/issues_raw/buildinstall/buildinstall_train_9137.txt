Describe the problem clearly
Trying to build and compile the example in "adding a new op"
https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op
This was moved to
tensorflow/examples/adding_an_op
and was not updated in the tutorial page.
After compiling the zero_out_op_kernel_1.cc example, I'm trying to run the zero_out_1_test.py. Yet this returns the following error
File "zero_out_1_test.py", line 25, in 
import zero_out_op_1
File "/home/me/tf_compile/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/adding_an_op/zero_out_op_1.py", line 26, in 
'zero_out_op_kernel_1.so'))
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/load_library.py", line 64, in load_op_library
None, None, error_msg, error_code)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: /home/me/tf_compile/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/adding_an_op/zero_out_op_kernel_1.so: undefined symbol: _ZN10tensorflow8internal21CheckOpMessageBuilder9NewStringB5cxx11Ev
Any ideas what could that symbol be?
