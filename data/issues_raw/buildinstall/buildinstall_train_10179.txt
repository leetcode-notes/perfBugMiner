Support python3 on Docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:latest

System information
I'm running the tensorflow/tensorflow:latest Docker image
$ docker run -it --rm tensorflow/tensorflow python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow'
Note that the same works perfectly for Python 2:
âœ— docker run -it --rm tensorflow/tensorflow python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow
>>>
Describe the problem
Importing tensorflow from python3 fails for the tensorflow/tensorflow Docker image
This is surprising because python3 itself is installed, so the solution is:
a) make tensorflow be importable from python3
b) remote python3 so it's obvious you need to use a different tag (point at it, maybe)
