Build on windows using bazel broken

Operating System: Windows
bazel 0.4.2, issue is seen at master branch.
It looks like sometime after our update to libjpeg turbo, our build has been broken in windows.
I am looking into it, but I cannot see a clear resolution to the problem.
The error message says:
http://ci.tensorflow.org/job/tf-master-win-bzl/218/console
00:04:27.376 c:\tmp\_bazel_system\rrc05caq\execroot\tf-master-win-bzl\external\jpeg\jmorecfg.h(242): error C2371: 'boolean': redefinition; different basic types
00:04:27.376 c:\program files (x86)\windows kits\10\include\10.0.14393.0\shared\rpcndr.h(193): note: see declaration of 'boolean'

I checked jmorecfg.sh, and tried to use #define HAVE_BOOLEAN to get around the issue. However that causes:

Creating the issue to track a quick resolution to the problem.

@meteorcloudy @mrry
@guschmue @vit-stepanovs Do you have any ideas how we can solve this?
We would like to also upgrade cmake build to use libjpeg-turbo, but before that I want to make sure it builds when we do.
