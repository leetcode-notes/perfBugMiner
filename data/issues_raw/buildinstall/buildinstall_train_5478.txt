ImportError: No module named tensorflow - Can't install Tensorflow

I am trying to install tensorflow on mac and it's giving me this error.
ImportError: No module named tensorflow
Here is what I have done in the terminal
`sudo easy_install pip
sudo easy_install --upgrade six
export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl
sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL`
After that I try to run python and tensorflow to check my installation. It doesn't work. I have spent 3 hours on the problem.
Here is another post about it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40472144/importerror-no-module-named-tensorflow-cant-install-tensorflow?noredirect=1#comment68200554_40472144
