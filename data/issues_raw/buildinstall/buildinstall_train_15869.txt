tensorflow/go for Windows?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): either
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4+
Python version: n/a
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): MINGW64
CUDA/cuDNN version: none
GPU model and memory: none
Exact command to reproduce: visit https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_go

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
Feature request: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_go doesn't have Windows 10 instructions.  I am curious if the tensorflow/go will be installable for windows
Source code / logs
I currently get an error on the ld.exe phase of the go get . for github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go : cannot find -ltensorflow.  I'm not sure how to specify that the tensorflow.dll should be used.
