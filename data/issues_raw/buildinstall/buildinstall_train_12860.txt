Describe the problem
When compiling a custom op using nvcc, which includes tensorflow/core/util/cuda_kernel_helper.h, I get the following error:
/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin/nvcc -c -o ~/Code/libspn/build/ops/gather_columns_functor_gpu.cu.cc.o ~/Code/libspn/libspn/ops/gather_columns_functor_gpu.cu.cc -std=c++11 -x=cu -Xcompiler -fPIC -DGOOGLE_CUDA=1 --expt-relaxed-constexpr -I ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/include -gencode=arch=compute_35,"code=sm_35,compute_35" -gencode=arch=compute_52,"code=sm_52,compute_52" -gencode=arch=compute_61,"code=sm_61,compute_61"

compilation terminated.

Copying cuda_config.h to /site-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda solves the problem.
The same issue has been observed by several other users in #6602 (see the comments added after the issue was closed).
