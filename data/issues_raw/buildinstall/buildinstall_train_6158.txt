installation issues on Ubuntu 16.04 GPU version

Dear developers:
I encountered one error with fine setting configuration
All the settings is right, and it said that
                                       all external dependencies fetch successful 
                                       configuration finished 

all the thing right until I generate the pip_package
(bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package),
process like below:
`yuze@nlp:~/tensorflow$ ./configure
~/tensorflow ~/tensorflow
