GPU implementations for more ops

Loads of operations in the embedding example are not supported on GPU. Some documentation   detailing this would be good.
I tried to get around the problem by using 'tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True)'. However now I get 'Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: AttrValue must not have reference type value of float_ref for attr 'tensor_type'

Thanks
