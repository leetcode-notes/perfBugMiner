Better support for initializing without explicit initializer for tf.string

When we use tf.get_variable() we have to provide initializer except DT_FLOAT dtype, or it causes error.
tf.get_variable(name="a", shape=(), dtype=tf.string)

TypeError: Expected string, got -1.7320508075688772 of type 'float' instead.

While I think it's unfriendly to TensorFlow users. So I want to open a PR to support initializing from non initializer for tf.string.
The same issue for tf.int is #4419.
And I have opend a PR #4816  to fix that including tf.string, but @ebrevdo suggested  me to open a separate PR fot tf.string.
@aselle Could you ensure is it a issue and may I open a PR to fix it?
