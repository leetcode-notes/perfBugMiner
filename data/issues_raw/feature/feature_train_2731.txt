Feature Request: Exporting Model to Eigen Only Environments

This would be insanely useful. I understand that some operations don't map cleanly to Eigen operations.
https://github.com/riga/tfdeploy addresses a similar goal and has a reasonable approach to handle custom ops.
An API where the eigen only computational graph is generated and the ability to "plug in" missing ops?
