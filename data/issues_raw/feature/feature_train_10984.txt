Building Tensorflow on Windows with AVX2 enable not compiling

Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10. Intel Core i7-6600U
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.2.0-rc0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):No
CUDA/cuDNN version:No
GPU model and memory:No
Exact command to reproduce:


Set up toolchain for for 64-bit:
vcvarsall amd64
Invoked CMAKE
C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build>cmake .. -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:/tools/swigwin-3.0.12\swigwin-3.0.12/swig.exe -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=C:\Users\sergio.murillo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35/PYTHON.EXE -DPYTHON_LIBRARIES=C:\Users\sergio.murillo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\libs\python35.lib -Dtensorflow_WIN_CPU_SIMD_OPTIONS=/arch:AVX2
To build the PIP package
MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release /filelogger tf_python_build_pip_package.vcxproj

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
I'm opening a new issue as suggested in issue 10199 to track AVX2 support on Windows.
I followed the instructions to built tensorflow on Windows using CMAKE and wanted to enable AVX2, but when it was time to build with MSBuild it returned 550 errors all similar to this:
"C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_core_framework.vcxproj" (default target) (7) -> (ClCompile target) -> c:\projects\tensorflow\third_party\eigen3\unsupported\eigen\cxx11\src\fixedpoint\packetmathavx2.h(274): error C3861: '_mm256_extract_epi16': identifier not found (compiling source file C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\core\framework\allocator_registry.cc) [C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_core_framework.vcxproj] c:\projects\tensorflow\third_party\eigen3\unsupported\eigen\cxx11\src\fixedpoint\packetmathavx2.h(278): error C3861: '_mm256_extract_epi8': identifier not found (compiling source file C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\core\framework\allocator_registry.cc) [C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_core_framework.vcxproj]
All errors with the same code C3861: identifier not found regarding _mm256_extract_epi16 and _mm256_extract_epi8
I do haveimmintrin.h in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\include but _mm256_extract_epi8 and _mm256_extract_epi16 are not defined in that file.
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
