feature request: "a trou"  (with hole algorithm)

To generate dense feature maps (e.g. semantic segmentation) the convolution and the maxpooling operators should have the option to define "holes" in the kernel.
The concept is used  in the paper:
Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs
(Liang-Chieh Chen, George Papandreou, Iasonas Kokkinos, Kevin Murphy, Alan L. Yuille)
and it is implemented in the excellent  deeplab library based on Caffe.
