Change draw_bounding_box() label input to allow different number of inter-batch boxes.

This is a question or feature request regarding the following function
tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes(images, boxes, name=None)
Current
The required bounding-box format is as follows:
[batch, num_bounding_boxes, 4], in which the labels are in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format.
If i understand correctly, this assumes that every image has the same number of bounding boxes.
Suggestion
Doesn't it make a lot more sense to change the input format to the following:
[num_labels, 5] in the following format [id, y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] where id corresponds to the image in the batch.
