Can google publish checkpoint file for some common network:VGG, AlexNet

In tensorflow/models repository, developer maintains some pre-built model and checkpoint files from some famous network, it is very convenient  for some developer don't have too much computation resources, train a network from scratch can take a very long time.  The author of these networks do publish weights file but It is not for tensorflow, mostly for caffe.
