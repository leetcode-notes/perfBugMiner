Android Inference AAR Release Builds

Android Release request
You currently have nightly Android builds.  Is it possible to also have a Jenkins job that publishes stable release (and maybe RC) builds for Android?
Or alternatively, can you publish release and RC builds of your Android Inference AAR out somewhere they can be pulled as dependencies by Gradle (Maven Central or wherever other Android dependencies are stored)?
