Request for distribution of prebuilt headers and libraries

I have been working on a port of tensorflow to Node.js and when the node module is installed, it currently requires a time consuming build step and the user to set up bazel. Here is how I trigger the install:  script and vendor folder structure.
As part of an investigation into this, I noticed that as part of installing the python package, tensorflow is distributing the libraries...for example inside of https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-py2-none-any.whl.

I was wondering if the tensorflow team would be open to building and hosting the headers and libraries for a variety of platforms and configurations (eg. cuda, no cuda) that can be downloaded and directly linked to in C++?
FYI: I have also opened an issue with bazel (bazelbuild/bazel#2206) about their plans for prebuilt asset distribution tooling.
