Adding go_package to proto definition files necessary for Tensorflow serving

I've went through guidelines about calling Tensorflow serving in Python.
Then I've decided to make it Go.
You can find my repo here:

Manually preparing files is unmaintainable. What about we add go_package to proto files?
e.g. for a github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/protobuf/saver.proto it would be:
go_package = "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/core/protobuf";

I think keeping the generated files in go' subpath is a good idea.
Does it make sense?
