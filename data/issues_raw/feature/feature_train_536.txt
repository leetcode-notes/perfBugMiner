Add a way to see the shape of the Tensors (arrows) in Tensorboard.

I think it would be useful to add functionality to check the calculated shape (if available) of the Tensors in the graph visualization. Maybe we could click the arrows to open a window that showed info about the tensor shape (and maybe other info too). What are your thoughts about that?
