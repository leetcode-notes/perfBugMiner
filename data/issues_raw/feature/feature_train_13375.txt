Add python 3 iterator support for `tf.convert_to_tensor`

I am working on TensorFlow 1.3.0 and Python 3.6.3.
I found that I have to write many unnecessary code to cast python iterator (such as return value of map, filter, zip and dict_keys) to list so that tf.convert_to_tensor could work. Supporting convert python iterator to tensor could not only help python 3 user write concise code without many list(xxx), but also memory saving.
