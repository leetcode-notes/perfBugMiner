CTC TimeOrder argument inconsistency

For example, here's signature for dynamicRNN:
tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, inputs, sequence_length=None, initial_state=None, dtype=None, parallel_iterations=None, swap_memory=False, time_major=False, scope=None)

Here is for ctc_loss:
tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels, inputs, sequence_length, preprocess_collapse_repeated=False, ctc_merge_repeated=True, time_major=True)


There is the difference between default behavior for time_major? (Rest of CTC module is similar in behaving time first.) This is unintuitive and should be changed to batch first in whole CTC module by default to be in consistency with rest of tensorflow library. (Or make other function time first, as long as there's consensus). Conv1D similarly puts batch dimension first, than time one. (Also did other of labels and inputs arguments have changed in ctc_loss between 0.11 and 0.12?)
In enforcing consistency developers using this library have less on their mental workload and enhancing productivity.
