TF Slim scripts iterate invisible files, don't appear to handle paths with spaces?

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.12


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source


TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2 release (tagged from git)


Python version: system 2.7 from Mac OS X 10.12


Bazel version (if compiling from source): home-brew 0.4.5


CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A


GPU model and memory: N/A


Exact command to reproduce:  TF Slim scripts such as train_image_classifier and their installed components, and download_and_convert.py


Describe the problem
Hello. Apologies, this seems rather trivial and potentially an oversight on my part, but I think its worth mentioning.
i'm attempting to follow the TF Slim models readme to get Mobilenet_v1 trained on a custom data set. In looking through the download_and_convert.py scripts and TFRecord creation scripts, I've noticed that:
• conversion functions will iterate over a directory and attempt to load invisible files on macOS such as .DS_Store files as jpegs and cause exceptions in image decode functions
• train_image_classifier does not appear to handle spaces in directory path names, and also attempts to iterate over invisible items such as .DocumentRevisions-V100 (which of course is only an issue if Volume paths with spaces are used).
Im likely missing some basic python understanding, or perhaps some of my issue is an interplay with the nuances of OS X, the OS X installed Python and testing not happening on OS X - but its definitely an issue for folks trying to do work on OS X setting up inference and tuning / retraining end portions of graphs.
Source code / logs
I don't think I need to include any source, but will try to oblige should anything be requested. Hopefully this isn't an embarrassingly obvious oversight on my part!
Thank you in advance for taking the time to look this over.
