Feature request: LU Decomposition

I suggest adding LU decomposition with partial pivoting to Tensorflow. The implementation must support rectangular matrices as well, and not only square matrices. Tensorflow already uses LU decomposition for solving linear systems of equations.
LU decomposition can be used as an efficient algorithm for finding the range of a matrix and its low rank approximation. The advantages over QR and SVD are that LU is more computationally efficient and is very suited for GPUs giving a significant speed boost to many computational tasks.
