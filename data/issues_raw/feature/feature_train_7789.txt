Generalize TensorFlowTestCase to handle arbitrary devices

Currently, TensorFlowTestCase can only handle CPU and GPU devices.
class TensorFlowTestCase(googletest.TestCase):
  def test_session(self,
                   graph=None,
                   config=None,
                   use_gpu=False,
                   force_gpu=False)
We are currently extending TensorFlow to run on another device and would like to update the signature to handle arbitrary devices. This could be done by changing the signature as follows, for example:
class TensorFlowTestCase(googletest.TestCase):
  def test_session(self,
                   graph=None,
                   config=None,
                   use_device=None,
                   force_device=False)
This would certainly have some significant ripples in the test cases, so I would like like to get some feedback before I start anything.
Thoughts?
