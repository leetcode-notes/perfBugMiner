tf.image.decode_image would be nice (handling both png and jpeg)

tf.image.decode_jpeg crashes on a seemingly valid input image with an  InvalidArgumentError: Invalid JPEG data, size 107746. I've used both the current nightly from tonight, as well as TF 0.9.0, using Python 3.5.2 on CentOS 7 on two different machines.
The image  can be opened/displayed without problems in Firefox, GIMP and other image viewers, as well as with the PIL image library within Python. The image is part of the ILSVRC2015 dataset, n02105855/n02105855_2933.JPEG. I've  uploaded it to http://imgur.com/a/pblKL for your reference (i hope imgur doesn't recode the image, let me know).
This is a minimal code example:
import tensorflow as tf
fn = './imagenet/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train/n02105855/n02105855_2933.JPEG'
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    image_contents = tf.read_file(fn)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_contents, channels=3)
    init_op = tf.initialize_all_tables()
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(init_op)
        tmp = sess.run(image)

Which crashes with the following error:
InvalidArgumentError: Invalid JPEG data, size 107746
 [[Node: DecodeJpeg = DecodeJpeg[acceptable_fraction=1, channels=3, fancy_upscaling=true, ratio=1, try_recover_truncated=false, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](ReadFile)]]
