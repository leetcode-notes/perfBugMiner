Feature Request: armv7k support for WatchOS

There is no build target for the armv7k architecture in the compile_ios_tensorflow.sh makefile. This means that tensorflow currently does not work on the Apple Watch. Having support for one of the most popular wearables would be a big boon to what developers could do with machine learning.
I asked a question about this a month ago on Stack Overflow but only got crickets, so I'm asking here as a feature request.
