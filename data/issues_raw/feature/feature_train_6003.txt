C/Other Languages: Support serialization and deserialization of Tensors

In C++ and Python, Tensors can be serialized into a TensorProto using functions like Tensor::AsProtoTensorContents  and make_tensor_proto
This is particularly useful when communicating tensors across process boundaries such as PredictRequest RPCs to a TensorFlow Model Server
Filing this to track any changes to the C API and language bindings.
