Feature request: configuration files for tensorflow

Matplotlib and theano provide matplotlibrc and theanorc files to configure the libraries, respectively. It would be great if we could add such functionality to tensorflow.
In particular, it would be great to

expose a floatX variable such that it is straightforward to switch between 16, 32, and 64 bit representations without having to modify code
expose the config.proto

A JSON representation of the configuration may be more suitable than the formats used by matplotlib and theano because it can more easily capture the hierarchical structure of the configuration.
