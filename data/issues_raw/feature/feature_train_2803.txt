Is it possible to truncate BPTT to less than max_time in dynamic_rnn?

I am wondering whether it is possible to feed, say, sequences of length 10000 while letting the gradients only flow back over a maximum of 100 time steps. This seem to me a pretty common thing to do in sequential learning tasks, so I am wondering whether there is support for that in dynamic_rnn and if not, whether it is planned.
