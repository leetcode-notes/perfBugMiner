Feature request: Provide API to test whether a copy of TensorFlow has MKL support

System information

Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.10.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): c++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9) 5.4.0 20160609
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce: n/a

Describe the problem
I have built a copy of TensorFlow with MKL-DNN support. The MKL convolution operators work much better with the "channels_first" (NCHW) data format. On non-MKL, non-GPU builds, the "channels_first" data format does not work for me, because a CPU version of average pooling is not implemented for that data format.
I would like to have my scripts test whether the current copy of TensorFlow has either MKL or GPU support, and if so, to use the "channels_first" data format. I can easily test for GPU support with tf.test.is_built_with_cuda(). However, there does not seem to be a corresponding API to test for MKL-DNN support. Would it be possible to add one?
