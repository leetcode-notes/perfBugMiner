Feature request: GPU ops for tf.unique; tf.where; and tf.dynamic_partition

This is a feature request.  As far as I know, all three of them currently do not have GPU ops.
It seems that if we can at least get a GPU implementation of tf.unique for integers, then the user can make tf.where and tf.dynamic_partition manually.  For those of us who are trying to build models that want to mess around with indices rather frequently, this would be incredibly helpful.
