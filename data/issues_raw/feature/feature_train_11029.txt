install with MKL and OpenCL without locate command

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Description:	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):master branch
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.5.1
CUDA/cuDNN version:7.5
GPU model and memory:Tesla K20Xm
Exact command to reproduce:./configure

Describe the problem
I am trying to install tensorflow on Tokyo Institute of Technology Supercomputer TSUBAME.
I want to install with MKL support, but locate command is required.
The university says that because TSUBAME is a public service and locate can be used to see files from other users, the command is not going to be installed. So it means MKL can't be used even it is installed in the supercomputer.
I suggest a feature to install tensorflow with the supports without locate command.
I guess tensorflow is used in a lot of supercomputers, the same problem may occur elsewhere.
