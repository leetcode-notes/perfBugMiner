Consider adding tf.identity_like()

Hey TF,
This is not a big deal, but you may want to add an identity_like function that theano has here:
http://nullege.com/codes/search/theano.tensor.identity_like
It would be useful for orthogonality with RNN's.
It would basically be something like:
def identity_like(input_tensor, scope = None):
  with tf.variable_scope(scope or "identity_like"): #in this linear scope, the library that you're retriving is Linear
    shape_0 = tf.shape(input_tensor)[0]
  return tf.diag(tf.ones(shape_0))
