Feature request - non-scalar Multinomial draws

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): OSX 10.12.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d 1.2.0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: NA

Describe the problem
For Multinomial distribution the _sample_n method does not support total_count to be a vector and throws a
NotImplementedError("Sample only supported for scalar number of draws.") 

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/python/ops/distributions/multinomial.py#L236
It would be a really useful feature to add.
