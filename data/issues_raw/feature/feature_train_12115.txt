XLA feature fix: "INVALID ARGUMENTS: Unsupported type in DataTypeToPrimitiveType complex64"

Currently, the XLA compiler seems to not support complex dtypes. I ran into this when trying to use the spectral ops (ff2d) in an AOT compilation. Is it possible to fix this? Alternatively, is there a workaround that succeeds now? I thought I could maybe bitcast a float64 to a complex64, but it seems bitcast is also not implemented for XLA.
