Transpose convolution layer for tensorflow (was deconvolution)

Has anyone already started implementing a deconvolutional layer for tensorflow as it's used e. g. here https://github.com/stokasto/caffe ? Is anyone else interested in such a functionality or is there any trivial way to implement this using the existing tensors?
