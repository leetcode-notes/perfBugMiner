[Feature request] add checkpoint_convert.py script to pip package

In the TensorFlow 1.2.0 pip package (at least for Linux), checkpoint_convert.py is not included. Because of #11168, 92da8ab, 157370e, it might be useful. Esp., in our framework, I would like to add some automatic handling at runtime when a checkpoint file is loaded and some variables are not found, to automatically try to load variables under different names according to _RNN_NAME_REPLACEMENTS. Thus, extending to adding checkpoint_convert.py to the pip package, it would also be nice to make _RNN_NAME_REPLACEMENTS public (remove the leading underscore).
