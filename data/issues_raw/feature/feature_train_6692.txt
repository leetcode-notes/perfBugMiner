Training only a subset of synaptic weights

It is often necessary to train only a subest of synaptic weights. One should be able to specify an arbitrary list of individual weights that will be updated/kept fixed by the gradient decent optimization algorithm and by other training algorithms.

There are no solutions for training only a subset of individual synaptic weights. One is only able to define an entire tensor as not trainable, but it is not possible to define individual weights within a tensor as trainable / non-trainable.
