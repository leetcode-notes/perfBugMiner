[Feature request] Instance Normalization

Instance Normalization is recently widely used in style transfer and GAN, since it avoid the drawback of batch normalization which brings in-batch correlations. Tensorflow only has quantized version instance norm right now, but a full version is also easy to implement, I am interested in it.
Also I wonder if it is better to implemented in C++ using eigen or simply add some lines in nn_impls.py with the benefit of being able to use fused_batch_norm. Mxnet does the first way while Pytorch use the latter method.
