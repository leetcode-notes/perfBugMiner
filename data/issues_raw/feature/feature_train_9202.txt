Add support for matrix square root

Please consider adding a matrix square root operation, with gradients.
It will make it possible to implement stable whitening, which could be broadly useful, in addition to being useful for my particular problem :)
Note, Cholesky whitening is currently supported in TensorFlow, but I'm not aware of any guarantees it provides regarding the correspondences between whitened and non-whitened data.
It appears Eigen already has a matrix square root function, so this might not be too hard to implement.
