Dropout hidden-to-hidden transition within an RNN

DropoutWrapper allows to apply dropout to either the cell's inputs, outputs or states. However, I haven't seen an option to do the same thing for the recurrent weights of the cell (for example, 4 out of the 8 different matrices used in the original LSTM formulation). I specifically refer to the hidden-to-hidden transition within an RNN. Take as an example Section 2 from https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182
