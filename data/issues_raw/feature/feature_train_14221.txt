bayeslfow.hmc - provide option for skipping the MH step

Currently tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc.kernel returns directly the update x and value of the potential after the Metropolis-Hasting steps. It would be useful to have an option to omitting the MH step. This, for instance, is required for implementing HVI [1], where we want to propagate gradients through the HMC step and not reject any samples:
