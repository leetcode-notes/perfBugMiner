C lib for windows with GPU support

I know that there is a windows c library built for cpu #10817.
However, I could not find one with gpu support. I've tried https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-gpu-windows-x86_64-1.2.0.zip, but obvious it does not exist.
Is it possible to have one?
Thank you!
