Can't mix tensors and python objects

I'd like to do things such as the following:
>>> tf.convert_to_tensor([tf.constant(1), 2])
>>> tf.slice(..., [0, 1, some_tensor], ...)
Currently both of these raise exceptions. The alternative is to use a combination of tf.expand_dims and tf.concat, which is a bit unwieldy.
