[Feature Request] Loop_function argument for seq2seq models

The RNN decoder has a parameters loop_function which allows to do some pre-processing on the output of the RNN before connecting the output on the next input.
That would be great to have this parameters for embedding_rnn_seq2seq and embedding_rnn_decoder. For now the only control we can have is no loop function at all when feed_previous=False or an argmax on the output called internally here .
The loop function parameters should be really useful to sample from the softmax distribution, instead of only taking the most likely output (as it is the case now with feed_previous) or to implement scheduled sampling.
For now the only solution is to re-create custom versions of embedding_rnn_decoder embedding_rnn_seq2seq just to change this parameters.
