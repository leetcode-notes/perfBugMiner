Nearest neighbor interpolation method for tf.image.crop_and_resize ?

At the moment, only bilinear interpolation is supported by crop_and_resize.
However, when working with little images (and with labeled images), it sometimes makes more sense to use a nearest neighbor interpolation.
Any plans of adding a nearest neighbor interpolation for the method in the near future ?
