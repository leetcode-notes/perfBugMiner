Dataset to TFRecord

The dataset API is excellent, I am even using it to perform data augmentation before training. However, I notice that when converting my dataset to tfrecord I follow a pattern that might easily be automated as a to_records method, in fact I think this is somewhat similar to using the cache method. Anyway, it would make it very straight forward for dataset users to create tfrecords.
