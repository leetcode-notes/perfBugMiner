TensorFlow equivalent to numpy.repeat

This is a popular question on StackOverflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35361467/tensorflow-numpy-repeat-alternative
But note that the answer so far only works for some use cases (the one presented in the question).
The best I could come up with for a general solution uses tf.while_loop, which is pretty verbose (and maybe slower than necessary). I'll add a link to the implementation I wrote for tf.contrib.training.resample_at_rate after the next internal/github sync.
