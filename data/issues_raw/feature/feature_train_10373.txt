Limit the number of images in a summary [feature request]

When working on dense prediction tasks it is very convenient to show the predictions of the network in TensorBoard to evaluate them qualitatively during training. Even if TensorBoard shows only a subset of these images, all the summaries that have been saved since the beginning of times are kept on disk. The occupied space grows with the size of the dataset, the sampling frequency and the number of experiments, often resulting in a huge waste of space. When the disk space is limited, this can heavily limit the number of experiments logs one can run simultaneously and/or keep stored.
It would be great to have a way to either limit the number of images saved on disk or to remove some of them (e.g., for old experiments). Here is what I suggest:

Add an argument to tf.Summary.Image to define how many images should be kept on disk (e.g., buffer_size or steps_to_retain). Also add an extra argument (e.g., retain_strategy) to select the strategy to define which images should be kept (e.g., keep latest, sample uniformly, ..).
Add a function to remove some of the stored images programmatically.
