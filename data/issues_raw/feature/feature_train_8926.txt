Image Distortions should be able to be applied to batches. [Feature Request?]

The tf.image distortion functions only accept a single image as an input whereas it would be much more useful to be able to place the distortion within your graph flow so any batches of images that pass through it get distorted too. I believe a current solution is as suggeested by @mrry here on Stack Overflow however it feels like, much like the other ops for images work, being able to take batches would be much more useful.
Is the solution proposed by @mrry the accepted method or should the distortion functions be taking batches?
