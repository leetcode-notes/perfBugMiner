Feature request: second derivatives for pooling operations

Currently, neither tf.nn.avg_pool or tf.nn.max_pool support automatically taking second derivatives, making it difficult to experiment with second-order methods on neural networks that use any sort of pooling (which unfortunately includes most modern networks). Trying to take a second derivative gives a LookupError, e.g., LookupError: No gradient defined for operation 'gradients_4...AvgPoolGrad' (op type: AvgPoolGrad).
Do you have any plans for implementing second derivatives for pooling operations, or any suggested workarounds like rewriting the pooling operations in terms of elementary functions that have second derivatives defined? Thank you!
