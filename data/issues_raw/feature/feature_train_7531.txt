Hyperbolic functions

I'd like to request support for all hyperbolic ops and their inverse:
sinh, cosh, asinh, acosh, atanh
Especially asinh is interesting, as it can be used as an activation function.
This would also allow to address problems with their calculation centrally, e.g.:
asinh(x) = log(x + sqrt(x² + 1)) will yield -∞/NaN (and break gradients) for small x. This is caused by the fact that the log argument x + sqrt(x² + 1) will get rounded to 0 due to machine precision.
