square of square root is identity

import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant(0.0)
loss = tf.square(tf.sqrt(tensor))
grad = tf.gradients(loss, tensor)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print grad[0].eval()
This gives nan. The gradient of sqrt(x) with respect to x is inf at 0 which is likely causing the problem.
Would be useful to have automatic inference for this such that sqrt followed by square can be removed at least for the purpose of gradient computation. There are other similar cases (e.g. exp of log) where such inference would help.
