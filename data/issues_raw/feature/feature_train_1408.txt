Generalized matrix multiplication with semiring?

Would it be possible to support (generalized) matrix multiplication with non-standard semirings?
In matrix multiplication, we have A times B = C, where C(i,j) = sum_k A(i,k) times B(k,j)
Using a different semiring practically means redefining the plus and times operations.
For example, the log semiring assumes that all numbers in the matrices are log numbers and redefines plus as logplus (aka logaddexp or logsumexp) and times as plus. This is useful for computing the log denominator in log-linear models, e.g., log Z = log sum_y exp(f1(y)) times exp(f2(y)).
The max-plus semiring (aka Viterbi or tropical semiring) redefines plus as max and times as plus. This is useful for finding the best path (assuming all matrix entries are log numbers).
