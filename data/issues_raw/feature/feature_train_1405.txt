Shouldn't tensorboard warn you that not all summaries have loaded yet?

Hi,
since I started using Tensorboard, I noticed some odd behavior that sometimes I'd open it and it seemed like a lot of the summary values were missing, i.e, even though it's already at 10k steps, the summary only shows 2k steps or so. Today I actually finally noticed that it simply meant that it was just still being loaded. I refreshed the page after a minute or so and all data was there. My PC is not bad (i5-2500k) so this was quite surprising. Any reason why the summaries sometimes take so long to load? Also can we get some sort of warning that not all summaries have been completely loaded yet?
