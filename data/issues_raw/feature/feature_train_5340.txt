Rename argument names in tf.train.exponential_decay()

The current function signature reads:
tf.train.exponential_decay(learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps, decay_rate, staircase=False, name=None)
When passing the parameters by keyword name (for example after reading a configuration file), it's pretty weird that the first parameter is called learning_rate since the function can be used for other decaying parameters as well.
A better name would be initial_value.
