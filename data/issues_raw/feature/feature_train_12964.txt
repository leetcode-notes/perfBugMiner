Feature request: Google Authentication support for OAuth2 AccessTokenCredentials

I would like to use the BigQueryReader to access  someone else's project with OAuth2 AccessTokenCredentials. I noticed that currently the google_auth_provider only uses application default credentials. I think it would be a great addition to add other methods of authentication as well.
