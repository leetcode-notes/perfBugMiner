Add gpu support for LRN

When I launch a network that uses local response normalization, it works perfectly on a CPU, but it appears to not have a gpu implementation and results in the following error when I switch to a gpu device:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'LRN': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/gpu:0' [[Node: LRN = LRN[alpha=0.0005, beta=0.75, bias=2, depth_radius=5, _device="/gpu:0"](conv1/conv1)]]
I could probably explicitly deploy this operation on the cpu, but it since this is a sliding window algorithm I'm surprised it doesn't have a gpu implementation.
