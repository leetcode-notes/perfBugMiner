Feature request: EASGD

EASGD is a very useful algorithm for distributed asynchronous training, which based on an elastic force which links the parameters of workers with a center variable stored by the parameter server. This allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable, which in theory allows for more exploration of the parameter space.
In practice I find it usually outperforms ordinary ASGD.  I have been working on it  for some days and I can make a pull request if you are interested in it.
