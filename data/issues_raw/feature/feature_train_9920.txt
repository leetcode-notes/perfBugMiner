Freezing graphs with custom ops

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 and MacOS Sierra
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master (quite recent)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.4.5
Exact command to reproduce: freeze_graph

Describe the problem
I've asked my question on StackOverflow here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43880729/using-new-op-while-importing-graph-in-tensorflow
I'm trying to freeze a model which contains a custom op. But freeze_graph gives the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<local path>/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.runfiles/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.py", line 202, in <module>

    raise ValueError('No op named %s in defined operations.' % node.op)
ValueError: No op named RoiPool in defined operations.

I was suggested on StackOverflow to build freeze_graph with my custom op as a dependency. I did that, but freeze_graph still gives the same error.
It was also suggested for me to open a feature request to make an easier-to-use interface for using freeze_graph with custom ops.

Here is the freeze_graph command I'm using:
