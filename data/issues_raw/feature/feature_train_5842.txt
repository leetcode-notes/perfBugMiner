Implementing SVD rank threshold?

It might be useful to use Eigen SVD's Eigen::BDCSVD::setThreshold function in order to cull the effectively zero singular values, perhaps by introducing a new parameter to TensorFlow's SVD so that tf.svd(tensor, compute_uv=True, full_matrices=False, thresholded=True, name=None) uses

the default Eigen threshold for thresholded=True
the full P = min(M, N) singular values for thresholded=False
whatever threshold is specified with a float, such as thresholded=1e-7

I can get started on a PR if this is something that might be useful.
