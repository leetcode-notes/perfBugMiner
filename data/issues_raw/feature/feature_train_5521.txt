Do not require execution of ./configure when changing branches

It would be great to be able to recompile tensorflow without having to call configure after changing branches. Currently, I get the following error message:
RuntimeError: Run ./configure again, branch was 'refs/heads/master' but is now 'refs/heads/<my branch name>'

The main problem with running configure again is that a clean build is performed afterwards--which takes some time.
