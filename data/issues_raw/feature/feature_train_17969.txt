Describe the problem
tf.estimator does not initialize all model variables in the following scenario:
The model function provides a custom Saver that restores a subset of the GLOBAL_VARIABLES,
and a custom init_op that initializes the non-restored variables.
In SessionManager.prepare_session there is the following code:
    if not is_loaded_from_checkpoint:
      if init_op is None and not init_fn and self._local_init_op is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Model is not initialized and no init_op or "
                           "init_fn or local_init_op was given")
      if init_op is not None:
        sess.run(init_op, feed_dict=init_feed_dict)
      if init_fn:
        init_fn(sess)

    local_init_success, msg = self._try_run_local_init_op(sess)
    if not local_init_success:
      raise RuntimeError(
          "Init operations did not make model ready for local_init.  "
          "Init op: %s, init fn: %s, error: %s" % (_maybe_name(init_op),                                               init_fn, msg))

The session manager does not run the init_op when loading from a checkpoint. It probabily would make sense to try the init_op at least in cases where local_init_success is False before aborting with an error.
If you agree I can create a PR, otherwise it would make sense to update the documentation to explicitely state that init won't be run in these scenarios (that should probably go in https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Scaffold)
