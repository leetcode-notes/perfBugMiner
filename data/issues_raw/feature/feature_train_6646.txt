A suggested improvement for tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse() (with code)

The sp_ids and sp_weights parameters in embedding_lookup_sparse() can be merged into a single parameter sp_mat which has clearer semantics. In sp_ids and sp_weights, cols are not utilized. However, in sp_mat, we will use row as instance, col as embedding ids, and its entry/value as weight. This makes better sense and reduce parameters for the function. I have written up the function attached below (slightly modified from original code), and also provided some test cases. Hope you may consider it.
def embedding_lookup_sparse(params, sp_mat,
                            partition_strategy="mod",
                            name=None,
                            combiner=None,
                            max_norm=None):
  """Computes embeddings for the given ids and weights.

  This op assumes that there is at least one id for each row in the dense tensor
  represented by sp_mat (i.e. there are no rows with empty features, if so, 
  put 0.0 in sp_mat entry), and that all the indices of sp_mat are in
  canonical row-major order.

  It also assumes that all id values lie in the range [0, p0), where p0
  is the sum of the size of params along dimension 0.

  Args:
    params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor,
      or a list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
      representing sharded embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a
      `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each
      element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.
    sp_mat: N x M SparseTensor of zero or non-zero weights, 
      where N is typically batch size and M is the embedding table size.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
      if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
      is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
    name: Optional name for the op.
    combiner: A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn"
      and "sum" are supported.
      "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding results for each row.
      "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total weight.
      "sqrtn" is the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the
      squares of the weights.
    max_norm: If not None, each embedding is normalized to have l2 norm equal
      to max_norm before combining.

  Returns:
    A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. 
    For each row in the dense tensor represented by sp_mat, the op looks up 
    the embeddings for all (non-zero) ids in that row, multiplies them by the
    corresponding weight, and combines these embeddings as specified.

    In other words, if

      shape(combined params) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]

    and

      shape(sp_mat) = [d0, d1, ..., dn]

    then

      shape(output) = [d0, d1, ..., dn-1, p1, ..., pm].

    For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_mat is

      [0, 0]: 1.0
      [0, 1]: 3.0
      [1, 0]: 0.0
      [2, 3]: 1.0

    with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where

      output[0, :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0 + params[1, :] * 3.0) / (1.0 + 3.0)
      output[1, :] = params[0, :] * 0.0 / div_protect
      output[2, :] = params[3, :] * 1.0 / 1.0

  Raises:
    TypeError: If sp_mat is not a SparseTensor.
    ValueError: If combiner is not one of {"mean", "sqrtn", "sum"}.
