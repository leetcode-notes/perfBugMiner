Is it possible to add a feature to tf.Print , so that it will be capable to save tensor value to file?

Since the while_loop operation is hard to debug, usually we use tf.Print to visual tensors in the loop. but tf.Print only print a summarization of a tensor. Sometimes I need to get all the value in a tensor, and it is not possible to use sess.run() to eval the intermediate tensor value in a loop unless use TensorArray. any body would add a save-to-file option in tf.Print .
