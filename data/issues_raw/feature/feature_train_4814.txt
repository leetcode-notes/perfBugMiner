[Feature Request] Make streaming metrics resettable

Hi!
Currently, the streaming metrics are (as far as I know) not resettable. I'd like to be able to e.g. reset the counter after each epoch. This way, having e.g. a very bad accuracy in the beginning of training will not still influence the accuracy value ten epochs later. It makes it easier to compare my results to runs obtained outside tensorflow.
The only workaround I found is to do sess.run(tf.initialize_local_variables()) after each epoch, but of course this can have bad side effects if I have other local variables that I don't want to reset.
Or is there a way to achieve what I want that I didn't think of?
