Creating cyclic graphs with the C API

I'm trying to use the C API to create a cyclic graph that corresponds to a while loop with merge and switch operations.
It doesn't seem possible though, since TF_AddInput requires a TF_Operation pointer, which in turn can only come from TF_FinishOperation, which expects all the inputs of the TF_OperationDescription to be filled in.  How can you create cyclic graph by creating nodes one at a time, if to create each node, all its input must already be created?
Just wanted to check I'm not missing anything. Thanks!
