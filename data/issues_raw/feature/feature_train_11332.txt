[feature request] Inconsistency of new Decoder api and Dense layer

TF 1.1 has released new seq2seq API (tf.contrib.seq2seq.BasicDecoder etc.) and Decoders have output_layer parameter, which must be subclass of tf.layers.Layer.
If one wants to use dense projection, it has to do from tensorflow.python.layers.core import Dense which seems a bit inconvenient.
Maybe the better way is to include Dense and Dropout classes into tf.layers? After that, one could write just tf.layers.Dense or tf.layers.Dropout.
