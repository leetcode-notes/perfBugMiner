preserving specific checkpoints

Savers automatically clean up checkpoints and that's lovely.  But there are special points during training that I want to be sure to save (e.g. transitioning from a pre-training phrase to full training), which I can't ensure with the current options (unless I just keep everything, by making max_to_keep & keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours huge).
Two possible approaches:


saver.save(..., preserve=True)
Never clean up this checkpoint.


max_to_keep is defined per save_path
i.e. Whenever I change the save_path argument to save() in the middle of the session, don't clean up the checkpoints with the previous save_path.


This is related to #8658 (with a little book-keeping on the client, you could do #8658 yourself).
