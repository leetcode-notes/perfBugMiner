Hyperparameter optimization and TensorFlow

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux-Ubuntu (17.10)
TensorFlow installed from: Binary
TensorFlow version:  1.5.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
I know that this question has already been addressed here and in Stack Overflow, but until the moment I do not see many evolutions on the subject.
Saw this approach here A Scikit-learn compatible Deep Neural Network built with TensorFlow,, that is, using TensorFlow (model build) and Scikit-learn to make the model's Hyperparameter Tuning.
So far this approach is the most correct?
Really wanted to be able to contribute and work with the optimization of hyperparameters along with the TensorFlow models.
I find this technique very important in Deep Learning...
thanks in advance
