Leaky ReLU as part of tf.nn

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Ν/Α
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): bazel release 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: GeForce 940MX, 4Gb
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
A leaky relu function could be part of the standard tensorflow package, under tf.nn. or some other non-contrib module. It could be something like
tf.maximum(x, alpha * x)

Custom leaky relus, which is what people do now, may be largely non-efficient. See for example the discussion in https://stackoverflow.com/q/45307072/5615276 .
