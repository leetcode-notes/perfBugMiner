GPU support for sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc

Are you planning to add GPU support for the operations defined in
tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc
I see that there is a GPU version for the sparse to dense Matrix-Multiplication version
tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_matmul_op.cc
but being able to use the GPU for Component-Wise operations would be very helpful.
Thank you.

Pierre
