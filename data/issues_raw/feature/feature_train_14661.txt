Describe the problem
I am trying to convert a graph from .pb to .lite format using toco, but I get this error:
2017-11-17 10:20:47.738777: F tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/tflite/export.cc:192] Unsupported operator: TensorFlowMaximum
I had a look inside the code, and found TensorFlowMaximum operator defined inside lite/kernels/internal/optimized/optimized_ops.h, but apparently it's not linked or defined anywhere else.
What's the fastest way to get this defined and linked?
Thanks a lot.
