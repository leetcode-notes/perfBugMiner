MatMul Broadcasting / tensordot

It would really help if matmul() and element-wise mul() were broadcastable, like in Numpy.  Otherwise you're writing a bunch of boilerplate reshaping code.
For example, suppose I have a T x n x k and want to multiply it by a k x k2, and then to a max pool over T and then a mean pool over n.  To do this now, I think you need to reshape, do the matmul() and then undo the reshape and then do the pooling.
