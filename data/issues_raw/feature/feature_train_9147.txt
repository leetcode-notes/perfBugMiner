Describe the problem clearly
model_checkpoint_dir is defined in the projector_config.proto definition but currently, it is not functional. I believe there is missing logic in tensorboard/plugins/projector/projector_plugin.py: in fact, a quick search reveals that model_checkpoint_dir does not appear in source. There is good reason to support this (seemingly planned) feature as checkpoint files and summary event files are often saved under different directories.
I would love to contribute a solution.
