ServingInputReceiver passes Estimator model_fn only dictionary of features, but model_fn is allowed to take single tensor feature

Describe the problem
The tf.estimator.Estimator interface allows users to provide a model_fn which accepts features either within a single tensor or within a dictionary mapping strings to tensors.
The Estimator export_savedmodel method requires a serving_input_receiver_fn argument, which is a function of no arguments that produces a ServingInputReceiver. The features tensors from this ServingInputReceiver are passed to the model_fn for serving.
Upon instantiation, the ServingInputReceiver wraps single tensor features into a dictionary. This raises an error for estimators whose model_fn expects a single tensor as its features argument.
