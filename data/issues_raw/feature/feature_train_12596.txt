Feature request: QueueRunner for C++ API that initializes from queues and ops and start with ClientSession

Right now there is an implementation of QueueRunner in "tensorflow/cc/training/queue_runner.h". It's created from a QueueRunnerDef that is initialized with string names rather than queues and ops objects. QueueRunner's current implementation is also started by using the "Session" low level class rather than the newer "ClientSession" class.
