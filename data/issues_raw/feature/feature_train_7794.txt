Cannot specify XLA config for learn.estimators ?

Seems that the MonitoredSession is being allocated directly:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py
    
    
         Line 962
      in
      f821ce0
    
    
    
    

        
          
           with monitored_session.MonitoredTrainingSession( 
        
    
  


and there is no way to pass or specify different graph_options to the session to enable the XLA jit configuration. Is that the case or I am missing something?
