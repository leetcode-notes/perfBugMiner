How can I load data from a data file just like http://projector.tensorflow.org/ does when using Tensorboard embedding projector

At http://projector.tensorflow.org/  we can choose a data file from our own computer by the Load data button(see the red rectangle below) and visualize the high-dimensional data


But when I tried to using Tensorboard embedding on my own computer (follow the instruction at https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/embedding_viz and start a server on localhost:6006 by command tensorboard --logdir=LOG_DIR )
I just find the Load data button doesn't exist (see below)

So I want to ask when I run Tensorboard on localhost, how can I enable the load data button like http://projector.tensorflow.org/ does, thus I can visualize the high-dimensional data by uploading my file rather than writing code ?
thanks a lot :)
