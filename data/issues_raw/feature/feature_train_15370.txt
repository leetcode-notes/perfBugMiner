Add the structural similarity (SSIM) index metric as a built-in loss operation

In many cases existed built-in losses in TensorFlow do not satisfy needs.  We can add ssim or (1-ssim) as the loss function into TensorFlow.
There is existed solution provided on StackOverflow, but it is better to have the built-in function with fully covered unit tests.
