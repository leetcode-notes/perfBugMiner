Describe the problem
Feature request: As part of an hyperparameter optimization routine, I use tensorflow's high level api tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor() (should apply to the others as well). The problem is that it creates for each instance an own new model_dir, which I can't delete during running the python script (even after the model instance is overwritten and no longer in RAM). It is a problem because it consumes rather fast large amounts of disk storage. As far as I can see there is no way to delete the temp dir while running the program, only once it terminates the dir is released and removable.
