No ability to verify a jpeg before decode_jpeg-ing

Say we are writing images to a dir and feeding them to a TF queue.  If TF goes to read a JPEG that isn't there for some reason or hasn't finished writing, decode_jpeg will fail.  Using something like os.stat() will not work on the tensor that decode_csv returns.
It would be great if we could verify a jpeg is our target image size before decoding so TF doesn't shutdown completely.
