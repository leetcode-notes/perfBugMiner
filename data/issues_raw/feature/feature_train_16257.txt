feature request: KL distance for Gaussian Mixture Model

I am hoping that tf.contrib.distributions module is expanded so that we can calculate KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) ,with its paramter list such as weight, mean, covariance given as Tensor Array. Because I think there is going to be a more need for that for many applications. Thank you.
With current version, either  we can calculate KL divergence for a single gauss, or create GMM object, but not KL for GMM.

I tried as shown below, but it didn'T work.
import tensorflow as tf
print('tensorflow ',tf.__version__)  # for Python 3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ds = tf.contrib.distributions
kl_divergence=tf.contrib.distributions.kl_divergence

# Gaussian Mixure1
mix = 0.3# weight
bimix_gauss1 = ds.Mixture(
cat=ds.Categorical(probs=[mix, 1.-mix]),#weight
components=[
   ds.Normal(loc=-1., scale=0.1),
   ds.Normal(loc=+1., scale=0.5),
])

# Gaussian Mixture2
mix = 0.4# weight
bimix_gauss2 = ds.Mixture(
    cat=ds.Categorical(probs=[mix, 1.-mix]),#weight
    components=[
        ds.Normal(loc=-0.4, scale=0.2),
        ds.Normal(loc=+1.2, scale=0.6),
])

# KL between GM1 and GM2
kl_value=kl_divergence(
    distribution_a=bimix_gauss1,
    distribution_b=bimix_gauss2,
    allow_nan_stats=True,
    name=None
)
 sess = tf.Session() # 
 with sess.as_default():
    x = tf.linspace(-2., 3., int(1e4)).eval()
    plt.plot(x, bimix_gauss1.prob(x).eval(),'r-')
    plt.plot(x, bimix_gauss2.prob(x).eval(),'b-')
    plt.show()

    print('kl_value=',kl_value.eval())`

Then I got this error... NotImplementedError: No KL(distribution_a || distribution_b) registered for distribution_a type Mixture and distribution_b type Mixture
I know that with python sklearn without Tensorflow, we can calculate KL for GMM as shown below.
