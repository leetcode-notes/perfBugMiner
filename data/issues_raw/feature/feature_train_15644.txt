[Feature request] define axis in 'tf.unique()' and 'tf.unique_with_counts'

Hi, just a small feature request:
It would be cool if one could directly

use 'tf.unique()' and 'tf.unique_with_counts' in n-dimensional arrays
define an axis along which 'tf.unique()' and 'tf.unique_with_counts' are applied
