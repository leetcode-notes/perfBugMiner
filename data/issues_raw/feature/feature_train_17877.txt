tf.manip.roll silently ignores negative axes

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): unknown
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
tf.InteractiveSession()
print(tf.manip.roll(tf.range(5), -1, axis=0).eval())
# [1 2 3 4 0]
print(tf.manip.roll(tf.range(5), -1, axis=-1).eval())
# [0 1 2 3 4]

Describe the problem
axis=-1 and axis=0 should be equivalent, if tf.manip.roll() works like numpy.roll() and other TensorFlow/NumPy functions that accept negative axes. However, instead negative axes are silently ignored. At the very least, TensorFlow should have raised an informative error.
