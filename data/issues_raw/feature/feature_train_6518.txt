tf.sequence_mask with int64 does not work

Given some tensor x with shape (batch,time) and seq_lens of shape (batch,) of dtype int64, I wanted to use this code:
    mask = tf.sequence_mask(seq_lens, maxlen=tf.shape(x)[1])

This fails with TypeError: Input 'y' of 'Less' Op has type int64 that does not match type int32 of argument 'x'. in gen_math_ops._range(0, maxlen, 1) < expand_dims(lengths, 1).
If I add seq_lens = tf.cast(seq_lens, "int32") before, then it works.
Casting tf.shape(x)[1] to int64 does not work (because of gen_math_ops._range(0, maxlen, 1) which treats 0 and 1 as int32 and then raises TypeError: Input 'limit' of 'Range' Op has type int64 that does not match type int32 of argument 'start').
