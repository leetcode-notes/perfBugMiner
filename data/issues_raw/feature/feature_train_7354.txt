dynamic_rnn_decoder doesn't have an initial_state argument

The rnn_decoder function used to have a initial_state argument earlier, which was useful for custom cell state initializations.
However, in the new API, the dynamic_rnn_decoder method doesn't have this argument. Is there any other to initialize cell state in this case?
