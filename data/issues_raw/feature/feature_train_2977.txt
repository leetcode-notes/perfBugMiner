Complex Number Calculations Not Available On GPU -- No Supported Kernels

Hey Guys,
Have been trying to implement unitary RNN in tensorflow. Big thanks to @khaotik as he has done much work on implementing unitary RNN's in his repo here:
https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow
When I try to implement this on a GPU I run into several kernel support errors. Here are some operations that do not currently have kernels for the complex64 dtype:

tf.conj
tf.matmul (which is crucial)

I'm unsure if batch_fft has supported GPU kernels.
Regardless, having these kernels would give tensorflow the ability to explore entirely new architectures as several new RNN papers use complex numbers now. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to write these kernels but much thanks to those who could do it.
