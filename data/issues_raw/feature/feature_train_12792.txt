Feature request: let transform_graph use summarize_graph inputs/outputs guess as default flags

tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/summarize_graph is very useful for listing names of input and output nodes, however it seems like you still have to set --inputs and --outputs with tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/transform_graph explicitly. Would it be possible to have transform_graph assume the same nodes from summarize_graph by default?
