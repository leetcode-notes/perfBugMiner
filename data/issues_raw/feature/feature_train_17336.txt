Describe the problem
GatherV2 allows one to specify axis. ResourceScatterUpdate however does not.
Use case: Consider a variable of shape [2, 3, 5]. It may be useful to update the first dimension with data of shape [2] at indices specified in the last two dimensions. AFAICT, it is not possible to do this with the current ResourceScatterNdUpdate or ResourceScatterUpdate operations. Using a variable with transposed dimensions such as [3, 5, 2] is a potential workaround, but is inelegant and would require that it be wrapped in transpose operations.
Can this be achieved using existing operations, and if not, is it worth create a new operation or extending an existing operation to supports it?
