add new feature for tfdbg that ignoring specific layers

Using tfdbg, has_inf_or_nan filter is very useful. But when I need inf at some calculations in the network explicitly, this filter catches inf every time. (e.g. keras-team/keras#9161 )
So I want to suggest new feature, ignore option, to add_tensor_filter. (I think it's around here. right?)
This option can take layer's names and layers which is selected to this option are ignored explicitly when tfdbg check inf_or_nan in the network.
This is also useful other than in my case above. If my understanding is not correct, let me know.
Thanks.
