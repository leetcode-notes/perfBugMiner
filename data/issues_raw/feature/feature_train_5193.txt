CuSPARSE support

For some machine learning /algorithm problems, we require to multiply matrices with vectors. In some cases - especially those associated with large graph analytics, the matrices are sparse. Given the major limitation with GPUs is the limited GPU memory, representing the matrix in sparse format is vital.
To this end, the CUSPARSE libraries (http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/) provide a suitable object model and various functions for sparse matrix/vector operations.
I would therefore like to request a basic CUSPARSE implementation.
e.g. -

CSR matrix representation - (see http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/#compressed-sparse-row-format-csr)
basic matrix-vector multiplication for CSR representations (see http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/#cusparse-lt-t-gt-csrmv)
