Is there any method to read HDFS file in a distributed way?

I'm working on reading hdfs file in between graph mode.
I used tf.train.string_input_produce() to read from hdfs and produce the input.
However, I found that all the workers are reading the whole hdfs file every time fetching a batch.
I'm wondering if it is a known issue or is there any way in TensorFlow that each worker could just read a part of the file like hadoop MapReduce?
