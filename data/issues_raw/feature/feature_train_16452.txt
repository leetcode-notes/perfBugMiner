Semantic Segmentation API

Hello, is there any plan to include Semantic Segmentation API in future Tensorflow releases, similar to Tensorflow Object Detection API ?
There are other semantic segmentation repositories in Github, an awesome list is here, but I would like to see the implementation from Tensorflow organization.
Thanks
