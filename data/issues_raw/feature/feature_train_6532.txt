Feature request: log-log scale for tensorboard

Would there be interest in adding a log-log display mode to tensorboard? That is, to enable plotting the x-axis in log scale for step count (and maybe relative time as well).
I find log-log to be very useful for inspecting learning curves (loss vs. iteration). Given a constant learning rate, standard optimization algorithms usually give a straight line in log-log scale. It's really easy to visually spot when the straight line behavior ends, which is generally a sign that the model has almost converged (for its current learning rate). On the other hand, in lin-lin you can't distinguish the two conditions because everything looks vaguely like exponential decay, and log-lin isn't ideal either.
