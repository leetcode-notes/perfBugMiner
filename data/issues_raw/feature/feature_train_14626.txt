[FR] Target for Cortex-M7

With the recent availability of TensorFlow Lite, it seems now possible to target embedded systems other than mobiles. Cortex-M7 is the highest performing processor in the Cortex MCU family has ICs from several big names. Would it be feasible to get a target for the M7? For those interested in playing around with one, I'd suggest the ST NUCLEO-F767ZI as it is affordable and available (I got one at an event.) Its bigger brother, the NUCLEO-H743ZI, doesn't seem to be available just yet.
