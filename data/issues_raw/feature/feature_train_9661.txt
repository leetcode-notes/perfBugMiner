[feature] Support Cross Compiling with tfcompile

Tensorflow (using XLA) is able to AOT compile a graph using tfcompile. There does not seem to be a way to, or it it not documented, cross compile the graph (ie compile on OS X for deployment on iOS). (Related SO question).
I suggest adding a means of performing this cross compilation.
