Describe the problem
I would like to apply a tf.nn.conv2d_transpose operation to each channel of a feature image independently. There is no tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d_transpose operation.
I tried using tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d_native_backprop_input however, when I try to optimize a function that involves one of these operations, it results in an error because there is no gradient operation defined:
LookupError: No gradient defined for operation 'DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput_1' (op type: DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput)

This is related to #7934
It is possible to achieve this functionality using conv2d_transpose by constructing a large filter with many coefficients set to zero. However, it is relatively inefficient, especially for a large number of channels.
