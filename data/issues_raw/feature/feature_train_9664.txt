Run half-precision models on Android

Is it possible to run half-precision (float16) graphs on Android (arm64-v8a/AArch64 supports half-precision)? If so, what would be the approach to do that? Trying to run a float16 graph gives an exception saying that only INT32 and Float32 ops are supported.
Thank you in advance,
