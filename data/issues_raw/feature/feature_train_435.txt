Cross products?

Can we get support for cross products? This is a fundamental / elementary mathematical operation and I suspect it can be more efficiently implemented in C++, for example as in this example. A function that would take two tensors of 3D vectors and return the cross products of the 3D vectors would be nice. This would be done element wise, so for two tensors x and y, the returned tensor would be [x1 x y1, x2 x y2, ...].
