[feature request] tf.matrix_triangular_solve misses unit_diagonal= argument

Hello,
It would be useful to allow tf.matrix_triangular_solve have unit_diagonal= kw-argument and treat matrix argument as having unit diagonal.
Sure, the same may be obtained by composition tf.matrix_set_diag and tf.matrix_triangular_solve. However, additional assignment here seems to be inefficient. Solving triangular matrix involves quite simple formulae where diagonal elements of matrix are presented explicitly.
