Distributed tensorflow on Mesos

In the distributed howto: "We are working on tools for launching tasks programmatically, e.g. using a cluster manager like Kubernetes. If there are particular cluster managers for which you'd like to see support, please raise a GitHub issue."
It could be interesting to have CPU and GPU dockefiles ready for distributed than can run in a scalable way on Mesos (with Marathon and Kubernetes)
