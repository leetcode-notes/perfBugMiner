Implement an efficient AssignMatMul() for general BLAS GEMM pattern

TensorFlow currently lacks efficient in-place matrix updates such as rank-1 update A += U V'. @rmlarsen recommends supporting these in-place updates through a single new AssignMatMul() method that wraps the underlying GEMM kernels in Eigen or cuBlas etc.
