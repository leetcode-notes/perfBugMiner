DataSet user provided shuffled order

It would be very useful if a user will be able to provide the order of examples within a dataset (with repetitions allowed, as only indices are shuffled).
This would allow having a more complicated logic (which involves balancing data of different types).
I assume it can be somehow supported by zip-ing together different DataSets, but it would be MUCH easier and more flexible if we could just pass a list of indices. Probably light as well as it shouldn't be a big deal passing one list per epoch.
Please tell me if this feature already exists, and if not, please add it :)
