Feature request: stop requiring the same dtype for inputs in tf.shape_n

As for Tensorflow 1.3, tf.shape_n takes a list of tensors as input to produce a list of shapes as output. However, it produces an error if tensors of different types are provided. As far as I can tell, whether tensors are the same type or not is completely irrelevant to the behavior of this function, making it an arbitrary constraint that limits its functionality for no particular reason.
Would it be possible to remove such restriction if there's no good reason to keep it?
