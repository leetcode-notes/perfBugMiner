Identity matrix initialization (was Custom Initialization of Weights)

Hey TF,
In your seq2seq library you define your weights W, by setting your initializer to none:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell.py#L675
I'm trying to build Identity RNN's and Unitary RNN's in tensorflow. For identity rnn's they need to be initialized by a identity matrix. Numpy easily makes this
How can this be done using get_variable? Is there way you can custom build your own matrix and then use get_variable and its initializer?
Also, when you set initializer = None in get_variable what is created? A matrix full of zeros? Thanks alot!
