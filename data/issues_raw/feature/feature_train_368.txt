Sampled decoding instead of argmax decoding in seq2seq (feature request for tf.choice)

Currently, the seq2seq decoders only support argmax decoding. To enable sampled decoding, we would need a tf.choice function to replace tf.argmax in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/seq2seq.py#L326
Any plans on implementing this? Can the desired functionality be achieved using other ways?

However, it would be preferable for choice to have the same interface as argmax.
