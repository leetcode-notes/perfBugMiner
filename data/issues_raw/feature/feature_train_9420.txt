[Java] Distributed mode support

Describe the problem
Is there any plan to add distributed mode to the Java API? I checked the code and it seems to be doable (unless I missed something) so I was wondering if anyone is already working on it? I went through the issue tracker and PRs but couldn't find anything related.
