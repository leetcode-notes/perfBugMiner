Gather/Slice/StridedSlice Gradients Support in the C++ API

Hi,
I noticed that there is currently no gradient support in the C++ API for the gather, slice, and strided slice ops. Would it be too difficult to add support for those gradient ops? I am asking because they are ops very frequently used in the context of machine learning models and without them building ML models can be unnecessarily complicated.
Thank you!
P.S. I have noticed that the Python API implementation of the gather op gradient uses indexed slices, but I am not sure if that is entirely necessary and can thus probably also be supported in the C++ API.
