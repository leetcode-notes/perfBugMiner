Add CUDA implementation of fused hue adjustment

Currently, the fused (rgb2hsv->hue_adjust->hsv2rgb) hue adjustment kernel exists in TF for the CPU, but not for the GPU. This is also why the CPU path can only be enabled "secretly" (via setting the TF_ADJUST_HUE_FUSED env var to true). Adding the CUDA kernel would make this op available for both CPUs and GPUs.
