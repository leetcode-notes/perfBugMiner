Misleading error message when running restore op with path to an .index file

Using V2 checkpoint files, calling saver.restore() with path to the .index returns the following error:
Error loading checkpoint from /home/peci1/tradr-git/tradr-ws/src/tradr-simulation/safe_exploration/scripts/ddpg/models/my-model.index: Not found: Tensor name "ActorFullyConnected1/b" not found in checkpoint files /home/peci1/tradr-git/tradr-ws/src/tradr-simulation/safe_exploration/scripts/ddpg/models/my-model.index

I think it'd be nicer to get an error saying "File ... is not a checkpoint. Please, remove the .index extension". This is roughly what you get if you pass any other file.
