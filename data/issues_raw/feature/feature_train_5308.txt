[Readability Issue] Using __all__ vs. wildcards

I have noticed that a lot of __init__.py files in the repo include
# pylint: disable=wildcard-import
from <...> import *
# pylint: enable=wildcard-import
I believe a more appropriate approach would be to use __all__. According to PEP 8 documentation:

To better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the names in their public API using the all attribute. Setting all to an empty list indicates that the module has no public API.
