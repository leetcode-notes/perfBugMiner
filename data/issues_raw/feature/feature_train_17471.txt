Feature request: tf.data.Dataset.unordered_merge()

We're dealing with sequence models and we are bucketing training data by using
tf.contrib.data.group_by_window.
However, it's sequential by nature and too slow.
So we want to call it in parallel giving up completeness of shuffle. The tf.data.Dataset API has
shard operation, however, it doesn't have unordered_merge. The zip operation waits all coming datasets and so isn't useful for this purpose. unordered_merge takes data from any comming dataset ready. It can be used to parallelize data flows.
Following is only for satisfying the format; This request is independent of the System Information.
