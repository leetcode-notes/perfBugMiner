Feature Request: MonitoredTrainingSession should accept checkpoint steps

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): n/a
TensorFlow version (use command below): n/a
Python version: n/a
Bazel version (if compiling from source):n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version:n/a
GPU model and memory:n/a
Exact command to reproduce:n/a

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the problem
As of 1.4, MonitoredTrainingSession conveniently offers constructor parameters for checkpoint_secs, summary_secs, and summary_steps. It does not offer a parameter for checkpoint_steps, so if I want to checkpoint by steps and not seconds, I have to register a custom CheckpointSaverHook. It would be nice if MonitoredTrainingSession encapsulated that, as it does for the similar summary_secs, summary_steps, and checkpoint_secs.
