Feature request: Audio thumbnails/summaries in the embedding visualization

We (@PFCM and I) have been working with audio data (bird songs) and would like a way to inspect (via listening) embeddings of small chunks of audio files. The main use would be to help us to validate and explore our data. In our setting we have few labels, so we are especially interested in using it to inspect clusters and validate (with humans) their accuracy/reliability/clusteryness.
We would like to know;

Are you guys planning on adding this sort of feature to tensorflow? If so, can we help to speed it up?
If we were do it how would you recommend that we implement it so that it is supported in the future?
