Add unsorted segment ops for prod, min, mean, sqrt_n

As requested by @girving in #7362 I'll file a separate issue.
The sorted segment reduction ops feature  prod, min, mean, sqrt_n while the unsorted ops don't include those. So I suggest to add the following functions:
tf.unsorted_segment_prod(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None)
tf.unsorted_segment_min(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None)
tf.unsorted_segment_mean(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None)
tf.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None

If you mark this as contributions welcome, I'd start working on this.
