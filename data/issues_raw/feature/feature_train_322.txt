Allow adding and deleting graph nodes and edges in Tensorboard

Generating the graph from Python is not an expensive process.  It would greatly lower the barrier to entry if new users & data scientists who are more comfortable with GUIs could modify graph parameters directly from Tensorboard.
If I understand correctly (per a short tutorial from @rsepassi) you currently cant delete nodes from the graph without regenerating it, however regenerating the graph takes seconds, so it would be nice to allow creation of nodes and edges via the GUI (like Cafe).
I know this is a really high-level feature request, and probably requires a fair amount of work.  Feel free to close it if this would be better discussed on a mailing list instead of Github Issues.
