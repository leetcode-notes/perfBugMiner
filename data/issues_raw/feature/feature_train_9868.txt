Chrome timeline for Keras?

I've been looking at the chrome timeline to profile my Keras models, but have been unable to find any documentation on how I could use it with my Keras models.
I am running keras with a tf backend, and my sequential models are all built in keras. For instance, this is how my model is being built:
'model.fit_generator( \
			generator= data_gen(args, 1), \
		 	steps_per_epoch=tr_steps, \
		 	epochs=args.epochs, \
		 	validation_data=data_gen(args, 2), \
		 	validation_steps=val_steps, \
		 	verbose=1, \
		 	callbacks=[checkpointer])`

I am at a loss for how I would try to generate a timeline trace for this model, and wanted to know if there is any related documentation for how I can do this?
