Bash argument completion for tensorboard

It be nice to have autocompletion for the tensorboard arguments.
I experimented a bit Garoe/tensorflow@3c21776 with the argcomplete, however the completion is too sluggish to be useful.
The entry point for the completion is after the flags are defined and the slugginesh is due to too much stuff being done before that.
Another option would be to use native completion, but that would require to duplicate the flag definitions for tensorboard.
