Provide GPU implementations for resize image methods

As far as I can tell, these operations are only provided on CPU so far. It would be very convenient to also have GPU implementations. I'll have a go at it if there's nobody else working on it.
Edit: I mean methods such as resize_nearest_neighbor, not the reshape operator.
