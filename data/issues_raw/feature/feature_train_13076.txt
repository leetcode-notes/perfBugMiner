unit test tools print all failure logs if failed

When a PR is tested failed, Jenkins just reports failure and tells where to check log. However, at least for me, I don't know whether I have the permission, and where to find the logs. So I have to reproduce the failed test on my own machine, but maintaining all kinds of environment is an unnecessary burden for each developer (cpu, gpu, py2, py3, window...)

It will be more convenient to attach total failure content at the end for developers to debug, like reports of py.test:
