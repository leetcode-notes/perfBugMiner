Math ops support for float64

I am raising this issue following this stackoverflow discussion. I found that there is not that much support for float64 ops, that is needed for some numerical applications. A number of other issues  #1061 #761 #547 and PR #1089 have been raised around this.
On the basis of how my graph is initialised, things like MatMul (also raised in this other stackoverflow question), Mean, L2Loss, Mean_grad/Prod, Mul_grad/Sum, AddN, SoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits are not implemented for float64.
Would it be a good idea to extend PR #1089 to more ops?
