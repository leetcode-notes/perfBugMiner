Support for special functions

If the intent is for TensorFlow to be a general purpose computational tool for machine learning there should be more support for special functions (i.e. the functions in scipy.special). In particular, functions occurring in probability distributions such as the gamma(ln) are quite central to probabilistic machine learning.
