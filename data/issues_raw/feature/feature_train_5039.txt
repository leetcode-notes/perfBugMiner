Tensorboard delete option for runs

Since many of us train with Tensorflow on a remote server and use Tensorboard to monitor and evaluate the training I think it would be useful to add a delete option for specific runs on the Tensorboard dashboard.
When I debug a training process I monitor what the network is doing and sometimes restart the process very quickly. Like this my data directory easily gets filled with a lot of fail runs. Deleting them from command is a little tedious cause you always have to check in Tensorboard which ones you might want to keep. And usually you have to close Tensorboard to be able to delete them at all.
Maybe you guys have a suggestion for an improved workflow! Otherwise I think being able to delete runs directly from Tensorboard would be a nice addition. As part of this an 'active' flag for  whether a run is still running might be interesting as well. Obviously this flag would disable the deletion option.
I am looking forward to your feedback!
Edit: If this is really a feature worth integrating I would be happy to look into it and submit a PR.
