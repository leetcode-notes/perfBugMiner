Describe the problem
TensorBoard supports image summaries, which is great for visualization. However, TensorFlow doesn't have rich operators for drawing, and people have to rely on Python libraries like PIL or cv2 for rendering. Those libraries typically use software rendering and are not very fast.
Considering TensorBoard is a web app, and browsers already have rich support for rendering, why don't we offload the rendering to browsers? For example, SVG is a simple XML format, which supports vector graphics, text and embedded bitmap images. Outputting an SVG seems to be a fairly easy job with some text templates.
