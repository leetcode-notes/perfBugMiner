initializer option for all RNNCell's

RNN's are very sensitive to the initial weight settings, but only the LSTMCell allows the user to specify an initializer. Could we add similar initializer options for all cells?
More control would be particularly helpful for implementing ReLU RNN's (http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00941), where the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix should be initialized to the identity matrix.
