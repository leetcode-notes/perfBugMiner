FPGA Implementation on TensorFlow

Hi all,
Recently, I read some papers about implementing Intel Xeon Phi on Tensorflow. Therefore, I want to make TensorFlow support FPGA board. But there is no information in Google and other forum/community.
For my understanding, we should implement the FPGA supporting in a class of TensorFlow which distributes tasks to different devices (like GPU/CPU). Is possible that implementing the FPGA supporting in that class? Or is there any good suggestions to make the progress to support FPGA on TensorFlow?
I am looking forward any help or advice!
Thanks,
Kevin
