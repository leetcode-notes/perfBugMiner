Feature request: Allow for custom hooks in Slim's `evaluate_once` to support TFDBG

System information

TensorFlow version: v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee

Describe the problem
The evaluation functions provided by contrib.slim.python.slim are wrappers around methods from contrib.training.python.training. contrib.slim.python.slim.evaluation_loop provides argument hooks which attaches custom hooks to the evaluation loop. This can be used to hook the TFDBG debugger into evaluation. contrib.slim.python.slim.evaluation_once however does not provide the argument, even though the underlying contrib.training.python.training.evaluate_once does support the argument. The code to extend the hooks with custom hooks is already there in contrib.slim.python.slim.evaluation_loop but that fix somehow was not applied to contrib.slim.python.slim.evaluation_once.
The request is to implement the addition of custom hooks to contrib.slim.python.slim.evaluation_once so that TFDBG can be used with this method. This is a really easy fix that adds a lot of functionality.
