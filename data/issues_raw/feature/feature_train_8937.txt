Has complex MVN been implemented?

I have below error for my code , where muC and SigmaC are complex vector and matrix
dist = tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalFull(muC, SigmaC)

TypeError: Value passed to parameter 'input' has DataType complex64 not in list of allowed values: float64, float32
