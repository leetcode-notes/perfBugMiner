Describe the problem
Tensorflow current does not have CNTK's negative sampling loss. I tried to get the same functionality using tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss, but the weights parameter of the function needs to be variable, instead of an op[If weights is an arbitrary op, I get sparse gradient warning].
Is it possible to implement this loss natively without doing an embedding lookup on weights?
