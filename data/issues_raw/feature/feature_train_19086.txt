[Feature request] SavedModelBuilder collection export

Hello!
As far as I'm concerned, there is no way to export custom collection with SavedModelBuilder.
Current implementation uses tf_saver.Saver.export_meta_graph method with empty collection_list parameter.
My suggestion is to add the collection_list parameter to the  SavedModelBuilder.add_meta_graph_and_variables and SavedModelBuilder.add_meta_graph methods. In this way, user can specify custom collections, that could be useful after model import.
