iterative pruning

It would be very advantageous to have support (tools) for iterative pruning in TF as in
Deep Compression paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149
Since in many cases it can give up to 2x speedup and 80% weight reduction practically for free.
PS: thanks for the excellent support of the framework !
