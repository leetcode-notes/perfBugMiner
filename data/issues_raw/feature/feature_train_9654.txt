Estimator's argument checking overzealous : model_fn has following not expected args: ['self']

I'm using TensorFlow (1.1) high-level API Estimators to create my neural net. But I'm using it into a class and I have to call an instance of my class to generate the model of the neural network. (Here self.a)
class NeuralNetwork(object):
  def __init__(self):
    """ Create neural net """
    regressor = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=self.my_model_fn,
                                       model_dir="/tmp/data")
    // ...

  def my_model_fn(self, features, labels, mode):
  """ Generate neural net model """
    self.a = a
    predictions = ...
    loss = ...
    train_op = ...
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
      mode=mode,
      predictions=predictions,
      loss=loss,
      train_op=train_op)

But I get the error : ValueError: model_fn [...] has following not expected args: ['self']. I tried to remove the self for the args of my model but got another error TypeError: â€¦ got multiple values for keyword argument.
Solution for now (as it was suggested on StackOverflow) is to use a lambda function to wrap my function my_model_fn (see below) but it will be nicer without it.
class NeuralNetwork(object):
  def __init__(self):
    """ Create neural net """
    regressor = tf.estimator.Estimator(
        model_fn=lambda features, labels, mode: self.my_model_fn(features, labels, mode),
        model_dir="/tmp/data")
    // ...
