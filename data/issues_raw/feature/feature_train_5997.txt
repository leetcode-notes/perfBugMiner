Please update the optimized protobuf binary library recommended on tensorflow.org

The following page [1] describes how to use the optimized protobuf binary to allow for large protos. Recently the protobuf library removed the limit on the proto size once and for all [2].
This should fix some of the issues still being reported on #582.
Could you please update the binary to the latest version and the documentation if applicable?
Thanks
