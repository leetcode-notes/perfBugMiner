tf.tile() doesn't propagate shapes when `multiples` argument depends on a placeholder

From this Stack Overflow question:

I have a variable a of dimension (1, 5) which I want to 'tile' as many times as the size of my mini-batch. For example, if the mini-batch size is 32 then I want to construct a tensor c of dimension (32, 5) where each row has values the same as the original (1, 5) variable a.
But I only know the mini-batch size at run time: it's the size of dimension 0 of a placeholder b: tf.shape(b)[0]
Here's my code to construct c:
a  = tf.Variable(np.random.uniform(size=(1,5)))
b = tf.placeholder(shape=[None, 12], dtype=tf.float32)
batch_size = tf.shape(b)[0]
c = tf.tile(a, tf.pack([batch_size, 1]))
This runs fine. However c.get_shape() returns (?, ?). I don't understand why this doesn't return (?, 5) instead.
This is causing an issue later in my code when I construct a matrix variable W with number of columns c.get_shape()[1] which I expect to return 5 rather than ?.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

The solution is to use tensor_util.constant_value_as_shape() in the shape function for tf.tile(). I have a fix pending.
