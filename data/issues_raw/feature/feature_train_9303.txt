Import additional RNNCells in tf.contrib.rnn.__init__.py

Some RNNCells, like IntersectionRNNCell, NASCell, are implemented in tf.contrb.rnn.python.ops.rnn_cell. I would like to try these cells but found that these can't be used as the same way as LSTMCell, which I can import by from tf.contrib.rnn import LSTMCell. I checked the code found that these cells are not imported by tf.contrib.rnn.__init__.py.
Is there any way to try these cells? Or is it possible to import these cells in tf.contrib.rnn.__init__.py.
Thanks.
