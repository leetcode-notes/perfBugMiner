Allow to build tensorflow as a bazel external dependency.

It would be nice to be able to just add a @org_tensorflow in bazel and be able to build it as a dependency.
At the best of my knowledge the syntaxnet dockerfile is the best example on having tensorflow as a submodule.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/c259259299db3b486ccdfd6cdec44b884623053a/syntaxnet/Dockerfile#L63
But still building it is not straightforward and probably does not work if you activate CUDA/XLA/MLK because those depends on other bazel subprojects.
Are there any plans to support this use case or I am missing something in the best practices to build tensorflow as a subpackage ?
