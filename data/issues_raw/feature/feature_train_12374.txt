Tensor Assignment

Hi,
I've been wondering why there are no simple tensor assignment ops. Currently one can only assign values to tensors by creating variables. Why is there no simple assignment op for tensors directly? An example would be a case where we simply zero-out a column of a tensor, for example, at some point in execution. In order to do that now we would either need to create a variable, or a series of slicing and concatenation ops (along with creating a new tensor containing the zero-ed out column).
Thanks!
