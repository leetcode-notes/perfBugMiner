raw video files to tfrecords (code integration)

Since I had to address the issue of converting large (and many) raw RGB video files (e.g. .avi, .mp4 etc.) into tfrecords for threaded/QueueRunner training during a research project in the past, I was wondering if my resulting code [1] could be of any help to the TensorFlow community. If not, I would make a feature request and possibly participate or support the implementaton.
When I had to address this at an early stage of my project, I couldn't find any useful implementations. This seems to have remained unchanged as of now.
