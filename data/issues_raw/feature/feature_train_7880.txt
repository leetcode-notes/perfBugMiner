Peek operation for queues

Peeking queues would be a useful addition for multi threaded TensorFlow applications. Right now there is no way to look at the first element without affecting the queue. We could empty a tf.FIFOQueue, look at the first element, and enqueue all elements in order. But that is not safe when other threads operate on the queue at the same time (see locking mechanisms #6360).
Example use case is an environment class in reinforcement learning, that buffers the next few time steps in a queue. The agent should be able to look at the current observation and reward at any time. Executing a step operation should remove the current time step so the next one becomes visible to the agent.
