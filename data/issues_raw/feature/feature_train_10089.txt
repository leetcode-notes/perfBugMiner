Scala API

Hi,
I have open sourced a Scala API for TensorFlow that contains much more complete functionality than the Java API, here. The README file in the repository contains information on what features are supported etc. I would really appreciate some feedback from interested parties in the community on the library.
One main limitation is that the library does not yet support while loops in the graph. This is due to being unable to implement gradient backpropagation using the current C API. @skye do you have any suggestions on how to proceed with respect to that? It would be really useful for implementing RNNs.
Other cool stuff (such as fetching arbitrarily structured data from sessions -- e.g., lists of tensors, or maps of tensors, etc.) are supported and are for the most part strongly typed.
Cheers,
Anthony
