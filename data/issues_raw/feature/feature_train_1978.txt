Feature Request: Viewing Only Computation Graph in Tensorboard

For study and debug purposes it could be very useful to view computation network graph in tensor flow, without having to dump any histogram/learning data.
@dsmilkov , I learnt from @danmane , that such a feature already exists for debug purposes in tensor flow, not yet available for users. What do think about possibility of making it accessible to users.
