Ops for Reading from Cloud Spanner

Is there any plan to make F1 public (be it a service in Google Cloud or just open source) and make it possible to store TensorFlow tensors in F1? I ask because as far as I can tell (might be wrong), there isn't a "native" database for TensorFlow (meaning a C++ reader with direct connection to the DB), and F1 supports Protobuf columns which would seem like a natural fit for Tensorflow data.
From here

The F1 data model is very similar to the Spanner data
model. In fact, Spanner’s original data model was more like
Bigtable, but Spanner later adopted F1’s data model. At
the logical level, F1 has a relational schema similar to that
of a traditional RDBMS, with some extensions including
explicit table hierarchy and columns with Protocol Buffer
data types.
