Describe the problem
The tf.contrib.data.Dataset.ignore_errors() function is extremely useful when processing data that has not been fully cleaned beforehand (e.g., with streaming input), but I find the "silently ignoring all errors" a bit too strict.
It would be very useful, for example, to know which files raise an error when processing the dataset, while keeping the exception-masking feature of the function.
IMO, the most flexible way to obtain this would be to include an optional callback argument to the function that gets called passing as arguments the value in the dataset that raised an error.
This way custom logging can be done for each erroneous data sample and dataset inspection becomes much simpler.
Would this be very hard to implement?
