[Java] Bulk data transfer for Tensor class

Enhance the Tensor class with bulk data-access methods, to support the following scenarios:

serialization of tensors in managed code (regardless of tensor datatype)
efficient transfer of large blocks of multidimensional data
support for direct transfers (i.e. using direct ByteBuffers)
support for typed Buffers
