Not supported for GpuManagedAllocator

GpuManagedAllocator was early supported at tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_managed_allocator.cc.
But it seems there is no choice for users to use it according to the source code?
The GpuManagedAllocator can help to enlarge virtual GPU memory to fit huge training models, so it is very important to support them.
So what is the plan next about this feature?
