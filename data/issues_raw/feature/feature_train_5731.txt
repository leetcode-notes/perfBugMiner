Hope intermediate state in dynamic_rnn

To implement a attention machine, I need the intermediate state to calculate the attention, but dynamic_rnn doesn't return the intermediate states but only final state.
Hope the dynamic_rnn could return intermediate states so that we can implement a attention machine with dynamic network.
