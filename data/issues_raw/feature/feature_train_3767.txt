Steps to reproduce
I am trying to evaluate hessian of a logistic function via the following program.
# x = 1
# logistic(x) = 0.7310585786300049
# gradient(x) = logistic(x) * (1 - logistic(x)) = 0.19661193324148185
# hessian(x) = logistic(x) * (1 - logistic(x)) ^ 2 + -logistic(x) * (1 - logistic(x)) * logistic(x) = -0.09085774767294841
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1, name='x', dtype=tf.float32)
#logistic = 1. / (1 + tf.exp(-x))
logistic = tf.nn.sigmoid(x, name='logistic')

gradient = tf.gradients(logistic, x, name='gradient')[0]
hessian = tf.gradients(gradient, x, name='hessian')[0]

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
print(sess.run([logistic, gradient, hessian]))

I directly run the program, it produce the wrong result.
TypeError: Fetch argument None of None has invalid type <type 'NoneType'>, must be a string or Tensor
It seems that hessian is None.
However, if I write the logistic function manually logistic = 1. / (1 + tf.exp(-x)), it produces the correct result.  [0.7310586, 0.19661197, -0.090857767]
What have you tried?
