Feature request: Use feature columns for labels

As you describe in the documentation

Think of feature columns as the intermediaries between raw data and Estimators. Feature columns are very rich, enabling you to transform a diverse range of raw data into formats that Estimators can use, allowing easy experimentation. https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/feature_columns

feature columns are pretty handy to transform input data. I would like to see the same functionality for labels. Why can't I transform labels with the same "data columns" as features?
