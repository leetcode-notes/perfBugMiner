Describe the problem
TensorFlow has a Cholesky decomposition kernel based on wrappers around the Eigen and cuSOLVER (for GPUs) libraries.
From experience, a sparse solver can provide huge speedups in the right circumstances. The cuSOLVER library has the feature in their sparse LAPACK library, cuSolverSP, and the Eigen library in the SparseCholesky module.
Alternatively, there is the CHOLMOD library which is supported by Eigen in the CholmodSupport module. This CHOLMOD library supports both CPU and GPU sparse Cholesky factorisations.
Would a Cholesky decomposition for sparse matrices be a feature of interest?
