C API Functions Support

Hi,
I was wondering what the status is for supporting the creation of functions in the C API. Couldn't this be done in a similar manner to how while loops are currently constructed?
Thanks,
Anthony
P.S. @skye This could also be useful for defining gradient functions for ops not supported by the C API gradients.
