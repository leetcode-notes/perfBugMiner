[feature requests] DecodeCSVOP to parse only the first len(record_defaults) columns of a csv

Suppose that my data.csv is :
1,2,3
2,4,6
and for some other purpose we add a new column to a new csv data2.csv
1,2,3,comment
the code below fails if the input is data2.csv:
col1,col2,col3 = tf.decode_csv(line,record_defaults=[[1],[1],[1]])
Hope that tf.decode_csv() only decodes the first len(record_defaults) columns only, so that it works for both data1.csv as well as data2.csv.
What's more, we can add  "a column index list parameter" to indicate which columns to be decoded.
