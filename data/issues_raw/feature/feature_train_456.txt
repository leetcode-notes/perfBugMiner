Batch Multinomial Function for TensorFlow

Hey TF,
Is there some sort of multinomial function that can handle batches? When generating content, it is incredibly useful to introduce variance by 'rolling a dice'. I searched extensively in the docs and could not find one.
Numpy has one, but it can not do batches. Tensorflow could capitalize on the fact that it uses a GPU. Thanks alot!
