stream_executor/platform/mutex.h doesn't compile under C++14

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mac OS X with clang/llvm 5.0


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
source


TensorFlow version (use command below):


Python version:


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.4.5


Describe the problem
There's an ifdef in mutex.h that uses shared_timed_mutex when compiled as C++14 and up. The file doesn't compile because C++14 requires using condition_variable_any rather than condition_variable with that kind of mutex.
