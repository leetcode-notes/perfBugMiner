Ability to Create New Device Context (GPU)

If I destroyed GPU context for any reason and tried to start new tensorflow session I got this error CUDA_ERROR_CONTEXT_IS_DESTROYED and notebook kernel crashes. So, it will be a nice feature for python users if they can create a new context for tensorflow if one is destroyed.
