Arbitrary dimension support for tf.tile and binary operators

tf.transpose uses template specialization for dimensions <= 5, then falls back to a slightly slower generic implementation which works for any dimension:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/transpose_functor_cpu.cc
    
    
         Line 23
      in
      504b91d
    
    
    
    

        
          
           template <typename Device, typename T> 
        
    
  


It would be nice to use the same mechanism for tf.tile and the various binary operators.
