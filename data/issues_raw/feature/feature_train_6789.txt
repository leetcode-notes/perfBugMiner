TensorBoard: Improve handling of tall images

Example of how it looks today, and an example of how it would look without stretching.
TensorBoard's CSS for image summaries stretches the image to 100% which makes it hard to interpret images, especially with pooling operations like in VGG-like neural networks.
Also, considering datasets as CIFAR have images of 32x32, the large amount of stretching leads to very blurry images. Could we either have control of the number of columns in a pane, or disable image stretching altogether?
