using GraphDef in C API?

I'm looking over the C API to turn a GraphDef into a TF_Graph for use with TF_NewSessionWithGraph, but I can't figure out how that's supposed to be done.
It kind of seems like you can't unless you use the deprecated TF_ExtendGraph API? But that's deprecated, so I'm not sure what to do.
