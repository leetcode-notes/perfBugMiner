tf_library syntax error: '+' operator applied to incompatible types (select of string, list)

Forgive me if I'm missing something obvious here (new to Bazel) but the tf_library Bazel rule seems to assume that tfcompile_flags is a string, while similar rules allow lists (cc_binary's copts for example). This is a gotcha that probably could be fixed easily.
Example
tf_library(
  name = "graph",
  cpp_class = "Graph",
  graph = "graph.pb",
  config = "graph.config.pb",
  tfcompile_flags = ["--target_cpu='core-avx2'", "--xla_enable_fast_math=false"]
)

will crash upon build with '+' operator applied to incompatible types (select of string, list)
The solution is to manually concatenate options in the BUILD file:
tf_library(
  name = "graph",
  cpp_class = "Graph",
  graph = "graph.pb",
  config = "graph.config.pb",
  tfcompile_flags = "--target_cpu='core-avx2' --xla_enable_fast_math=false"
)
