Feature Request - SRU (Simple Recurrent Unit) Cell

ArXiv path: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755
This is a recently proposed, parallelization-friendly RNN cell. The author released his own PyTorch version of the SRU. We are looking forward to an offical tensorflow implementation with Cudnn optimizations.
