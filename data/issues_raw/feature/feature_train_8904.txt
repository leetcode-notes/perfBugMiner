Support Kernels for SVM

Kernels in support vector machines are really usefull. I would like to test some object detection algorithms in tensorflow using svm and a radial basis kernel.
I am willing to help implementing kernels for support vector machines, though I am not familiar with the sdca optimization.
Is there any design doc, or plan how to add more features to the svm estimator api?
