Gradient for tf.cholesky

It would be really nice to have a gradient operation for tf.cholesky similar to Theano's CholeskyGrad.
I'll be seeing if I can implement the gradient using tf.control_flow_ops.While following the suggestion provided here, but if someone with C++ experience can implement the gradient directly in C++, that'd be great.
Thanks!
