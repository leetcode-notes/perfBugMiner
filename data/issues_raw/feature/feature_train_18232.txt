[RFC] Native GPU-Direct RDMA implementation of collective ops

In a recent CL, the remote memory access based collective ops (CollectiveRemoteAccess) and a local implementation (CollectiveRemoteAccessLocal) has been added (looks like @poxvoculi's glorious work).
I am wondering if there would be enough space for a verbs implementation of the remote access collective ops, or its design has been carried out and TF team will release its implementation soon? If there is no such plan in a short term, I would love to extend the GDR runtime to the collective ops. In particular, I would like to request for comments to the future of the GDR runtime, as it seems the contrib modules may eventually be moved out to other places (#16984 (comment)).
Any suggestion from the TF team?
