Is there a function which performs the opposite of tf.extract_image_patches ?

Hello,
I was looking for a function in the latest tf version, which performs the opposite of tf.extract_image_patches. If I did not miss it, it would be great to have this feature in tensorflow.
It would help me for the task I am doing.
Thanks in advance,
Vignesh
