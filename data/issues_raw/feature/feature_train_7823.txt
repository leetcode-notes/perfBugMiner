Gradient Boosting Decision Trees at TensorFlow

At TensorFlow Dev Summit 2017 Mr. Ashish Agarwal gave a presentation for ML Toolkit and said that Gradient Boosting Decision Trees are coming soon.  I would like to ask two questions:

Is there an approximate timeline for when this feature might be released?
Is there any information if we will be able to leverage tensorflow's local (GPU computing) and distributed capabilities (for example as presented by Mr. Jonathan Hseu) for this particular algorithm?
