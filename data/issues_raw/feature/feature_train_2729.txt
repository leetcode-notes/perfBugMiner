TensorBoard inception v3 visualization is horizontal and almost unusable

Environment info
Operating System: Linux x64 GPU
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: CUDA 7.5, cuDNN v4
If installed from binary pip package, provide: 0.8.0
I've been trying to retrain the inception v3 network using the image_retraining example, and then the inception v3 model in the models repo.
The image_retraining model[1] seems to visualize vertically and it relatively straight forward to look at.
The model from the models repo[2] visualizes horizontally, making zooming in and exploring the model really tricky.
