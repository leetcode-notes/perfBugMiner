Channel number of convolution output is unspecified when atrous rate > 1

Python 2.7
Tensorflow v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d and v1.3.0-rc1-2361-gd1286ab
Easily reproduced by the following code:
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [1, 10, None, None])
w = tf.zeros([3, 3, 10, 20])
y = tf.nn.convolution(x, w, 'VALID', [1]*2, [2]*2, data_format='NCHW')
print(y)
The input has known channel number but unknown width and height, in NCHW format. The convolution has rate >= 2. The channel number of the output y is obviously known, (1, 20, None, None) in this example, depending on the shape of w. However the execution result gives
Tensor("convolution/BatchToSpaceND:0", shape=(1, ?, ?, ?), dtype=float32)

I believe this is related to the reshaping operation in the atrous convolution. The issue happens only when the spatial shape is unknown and with NCHW format. Not sure if this happens to the latest version.
