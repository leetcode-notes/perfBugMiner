generator_input_fn for tensorflow estimator?

I find there is numpy_input_fn and pandas_input_fn to construct the input_fn for tensorflow estimator.
However, sometimes I need a more flexible constructor that can create the input_fn from a custom generator/iterator. It seems that Tensorflow doesn't have this feature currently.
There is a generator_input_fn for tensorflow.contrib.learn but I think that is not compatible with Tensorflow Estimator.
Is there any plan to add generator_input_fn for tensorflow estimator?
