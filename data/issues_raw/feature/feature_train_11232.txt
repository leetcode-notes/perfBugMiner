Enable MKL Support in TensorFlow for Java

Description
I'm trying to use TensorFlow for Java in a Dataflow pipeline. Currently everything appears to be working but since Dataflow only supports CPU instances, inference time seems to be quite slow. In my previous experiments I've seen that building TensorFlow from source with MKL support usually provides a very significant speed gain.
Since I'm currently using TensorFlow for Java directly from Maven repository, I won't be able to get MKL support. Would it be possible to enable MKL support for TensorFlow in Java?
