Numerically stable summation methods

It would be nice to be able to use numerically stable summation methods like

pairwise summation
Kahan summation

for applications where numerical accuracy is important.
This could work with an optional stable keyword argument to tf.reduce_sum or via a tf.stable_reduce_sum op.
I think implementing Kahan summation in the Eigen tensor library wouldn't be difficult at all, we would simply have to add a stateful KahanSumReducer.
It should also be possible to provide a vectorized version.
Pairwise summation might be more difficult, as the reduction code would have to be touched.
