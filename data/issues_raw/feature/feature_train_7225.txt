Feature request: equivalent of np.clip

tf.clip_by_value is missing an important property of np.clip which lets upper/lower bounds to be tensors, whereas tf.clip_by_value only takes scalars
A work-around is tf.minimum(upper, tf.maximum(lower, x)) but that uses 2x memory for gradients. Another potential work-aroundÂ is to use tf.map_fn + tf.clip_by_value, but it is orders of magnitude slower. Some profiling: https://github.com/yaroslavvb/notebooks/blob/master/clipping-profile.ipynb
