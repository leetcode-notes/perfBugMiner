Feature request: Support for non-minibatch data for intrinsic functions

Some functions in the TensorFlow standard library makes an assumption that we're always feeding minibatches.
One example is tf.nn.softmax which assumes a 2-D input of shape [batch_size, num_classes]. It would be nice to have a second API to such subroutines that work also without an assumption of a minibatch dimension in the input tensor.
