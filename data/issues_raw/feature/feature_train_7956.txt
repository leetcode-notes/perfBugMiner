Method log_prob_with_logits() for Dirichlet

It would be useful to have a log_prob_with_logits() method for the Dirichlet distribution.
The reason being is that it is often useful to model the discrete posterior distribution in log space, which doesn't let all probabilities to go exactly to zero. Then the Dirichlet prior can be applied to the data in log space. Note, that if the posterior is converted to the normalised distribution, then some of the discrete probabilities may actually go to zero due to the rounding errors. Then the Dirichlet prior cannot be applied to this distribution because it doesn't allow zero probabilities.
The log_prob_with_logits() calculation would be very simple to implement. The log(x_i) would need to be replaced with just x_i, and an additional term with LogSumExp(x) added.
This would actually enable the possibility to use the Dirichlet prior on the discrete viariables in log space (can also be part of a neural network).
