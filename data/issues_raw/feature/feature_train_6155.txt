Update tf.zeros_initializer method

The tf.zeros_initializer method has an unnecessary argument, asking for the tensor shape. See tensorflow documentation. The tf.ones_initializer method, which is essentialy equivalent in functionality, does not have this argument.
As a sidenote, the method tf.constant_initializer (see documentation) also doesn't have this argument and serves the same purpose. In fact, if no keyword args are provided, it will behave as the zeros_initializer is intended to.
