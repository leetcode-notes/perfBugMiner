Need force_gpu_if_available for tests

For GPU tests, we have the force_gpu and use_gpu flags. force_gpu=True is good for manual testing during development, but if an op cannot be placed on a gpu because there isn't a GPU or because TensorFlow was built without GPU support, it will make the test fail.
For tests, we really need a way to say "fail if a GPU is available, but it's not used". Could be as simple as providing the equivalent of force_gpu=tf.compiled_with_GPU_support() and tf.get_GPU_devices(). Both functions don't exist, but really should.
