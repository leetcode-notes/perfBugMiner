[Feature]Any plan to add Dynamic Graph support in TF?

We know that TF follows the define-and-run paradigm, while some other DL frameworks support define-by-run paradigm, such as pyTorch and Chainer.
"define-and-run" actually reduce the mind-set overhead for DL modeling guys due to that it can help reduce the try-and-feedback loop.
MxNet(another originally define-and-run DL framework) already adds support for dynamic graph through Gluon(https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope).
As far as I know, there are TensorFlow Fold project(https://github.com/tensorflow/fold) which provides dynamic batching support, but it doesn't provides the define-by-run support.
Is there any plan for TFer to add the dynamic graph support in the near future?
If not, my team is going to work on this stuff, before jumping in, I just want to make sure our energies  are invested on unique features rather than duplicated ones.
Thanks
