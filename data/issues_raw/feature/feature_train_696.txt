Serialize GraphKeys into GraphDef

As I understand it, GraphKeys.VARIABLES and GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES (and other collections) are not serialized with the GraphDef. This means that in order to train a model that had previously been serialized we must recreate all of the variables (simply reifying a GraphDef doesn't perform the same init.)
There seem to be two solutions here:

To serialize these keys into their respective types on GraphDef so we can add the variables to their appropriate collections inside import_graph_def. (Seems easy enough?)
To recreate the variables the same way, they're created with tf.Variable when calling import_graph_def. (Seems harder, maybe cleaner?)

This is apparently on the roadmap per http://stackoverflow.com/a/33763208/307401 but I'd be happy to contribute a fix if someone can point me in the right direction.
(The goal is to be able to train something I've previously serialized.)
EDIT: This should also improve restoring GraphDef with Saver which is cumbersome.
