Create support for a score threshold in NonMaxSuppression to skip over boxes with low score

Right now tensorflow::ops::NonMaxSuppression only prunes away boxes that have a high IOU overlap with previously selected boxes. It would be nice to also support a threshold on score so that the algorithm can skip over boxes that have a score below that threshold. We strongly believe this feature will speed up nms. Is there a plan to add this score threshold as a parameter?
