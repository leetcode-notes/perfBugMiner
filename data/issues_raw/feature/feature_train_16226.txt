Include netstat in the tensorflow docker container

Describe the problem
This is a feature request to add net-tools to the Tensorflow docker containers.  Having netstat in the Tensorflow container will make it easier to find open ports in a multi-tenant environment when launching Tensorflow Distributed or Tensorboard.
Note, I have found how to add netstat (see URL below), but would prefer not having to change or maintain a modified version of the Tensorflow container.
