missing instruction for BahdanauAttention

This is just my opinion:
when call BahdanauAttention instance , it create a variable scope with None name_or_scope variable.
While name_or_scope is None, and get_variable with the same name inside the variable scope repeatedly, it will automatically add '_N' to the name of the scope. And I think it is not compatible with some functions like stati_rnn, because there are explicit 'for loop' inside the function and every loop of 'for loop' will create different variables inside the variable scope but not creating once and sharing
