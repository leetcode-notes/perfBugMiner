#FR CG pipeline in tf

#in brief
build computer graphic render pipeline with tf
In GDC2017's talk 'FrameGraph: Extensible Rendering Architecture in Frostbite', a few slide inspire me, why don't CG and CV use the same computation platform, share 'GPU cluster' 'memory management' and 'operation oplimization' code, iteract with each other directly.  I am going to implement a simple ray trace with tf, is there any comment or suggestion?
