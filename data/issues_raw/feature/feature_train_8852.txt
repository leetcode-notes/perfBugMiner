Allow SavedModelBuilder to overwrite existing directory

Currently, SavedModelBuilder throws an exception when called with a directory that already exists. It will be helpful to add a flag overwrite when initializing SavedModelBuilder, which allows it to overwrite the contents of the directory when .save() is called.
When training a model every couple of hours on fresh data, it will be easier to overwrite existing models than having to implement housekeeping code around cleaning old models or writing code to move around new model after training.
