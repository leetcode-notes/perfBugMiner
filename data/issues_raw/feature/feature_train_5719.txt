[FEATURE REQUEST]Calculate topK on GPU with k-selection algos

Hi,
I am currently using tf.nn.top_k in my code. However, I found this operation is calculated on CPU and it is quite slow.
So I am wondering if it is possible to calculate topK on GPU?
Here are the papers and cuda codes about k-selection on GPU:

Hope someday this feature will be added to tensorflow.
