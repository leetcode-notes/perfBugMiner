[Tensorboard Feature Requests] Binding the run selectors of the tabs together

For now, in order to check the Events/Image/Distribution tabs for a run, I need to make the selection for each of the tab. It would be nice to be able to apply the same run filters across all tabs. If I made a selection in one tab, the other tabs will use the same filters automatically.
