Optimizers in the C++ API

There is currently no Optimizer in the C++ API compared as the ones that we can find in the Python API.
It means, when using only the C++ API that we have to manually collect the gradients and apply them.
Don't you think it should be a convenient add? Retrieving the gradients and applying them is kind of hard and error prone. If yes, I could work on it and create an Optimizer + GradientDescentOptimizer in the C++ API.
I maybe missed something.
