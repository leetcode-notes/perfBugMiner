What is the possible op substitute for set of OPerations on CPU to DSP Hexagon

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64bits
Android Version: 7.1 (Nougat)
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
HEXAGON SDK: 3.1
nnlib source: https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/hexagon_nn/nnlib
I am trying to build a graph to run on hexagon,
it uses few op's which hexagon doesn't support.
native : graph_transferer.cc:109 Failed to transfer graph Invalid argument: Mean has not been implemented yet.
OP's details are as below:-
{"Mean", SupportedOpType::??},
{"RealDiv", SupportedOpType::??},
{"Pow", SupportedOpType::??},
{"Conv2DBackpropInput", SupportedOpType::??},
{"Square", SupportedOpType::??},
{"SquaredDifference", SupportedOpType::??},
{"StopGradient", SupportedOpType::??},
{"Reciprocal", SupportedOpType::??},
Is there any possible substitute for the operation types Mean, Pow, Conv2DBackpropInput etc.. for hexagon.
thanks in advance.
