Show responsible nodes when ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable

The error message
ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable

Is not particularly informative and it would be nice to see if there is a node preventing the gradient calculation (ie Gradient Cannot be calculated for Cast or ResizeBilinear operation) or if there is simply no connection (the variable is not connected to the loss function in any way.)
Both of the following issues dealt with this and debugging would be easier if the error message was more explicit.

A more obscure but related issue: #1511
