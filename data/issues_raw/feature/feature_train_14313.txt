Feature request: add tf.decode_libsvm op

Hi, since libsvm format is used widespreadly to store sparse data, and is supported by many main-stream frameworks:

spark: LibSVMDataSource
sklearn: load_svmlight_file
xgboost: LibSVM format

Could tensorflow support to parse libsvm format like tf.decode_csv?
