feature request: complex64 support in diag op

tf.diag only supports float32, float64, int32, int64 right now; is it possible to also include complex64?
I may get around to extending the op to do this for my own purposes, but perhaps someone else is better positioned to add this functionality. Or is there some deeper reason it's not supported?
