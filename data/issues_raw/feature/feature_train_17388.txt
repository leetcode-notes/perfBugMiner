Inconsistent OMPI_SKIP_MPICXX define

Looks like we #define OMPI_SKIP_MPICXX before #include third_party/mpi/mpi.h in two places:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/mpi_collectives/kernels/ring.h
    
    
        Lines 32 to 34
      in
      b79ce00
    
    
    
    

        
          
           // Needed to avoid header issues with C++-supporting MPI implementations 
        

        
          
           #define OMPI_SKIP_MPICXX 
        

        
          
           #include "third_party/mpi/mpi.h" 
        
    
  



  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/mpi_collectives/kernels/mpi_ops.cc
    
    
        Lines 36 to 37
      in
      b79ce00
    
    
    
    

        
          
           #define OMPI_SKIP_MPICXX 
        

        
          
           #include "third_party/mpi/mpi.h" 
        
    
  


But it is not defined here:

  
    
      tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/mpi/mpi_utils.h
    
    
         Line 27
      in
      b79ce00
    
    
    
    

        
          
           #include "third_party/mpi/mpi.h" 
        
    
  


Because the first two are defined without an #ifndef, I can't define it in a compiler flag. We should probably add it to the last one, or at least make the first two no-ops if it's already set.
