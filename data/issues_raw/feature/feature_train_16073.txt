Feature request: (optionally) return all audio streams in tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio

I'm trying to read musdb18 with tf.data and it comes in the form of mp4 files with multiple audio streams so ffmpeg -map is needed.
tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio cannot be configured to choose the audio stream. I wonder if we could have a tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audios that returns every audio stream in the file, or if we could have a new argument in tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_audio for choosing streams.
Being able to choose the audio stream is also important for getting the right language in a movie file's audio, and similarly tf.contrib.ffmpeg.decode_video could need the same extension (though multiple video streams is not as common AFAIK).
