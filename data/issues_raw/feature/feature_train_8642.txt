Graph with tf.cond can not be serialized correctly after calling remove_training_nodes.

#3667 may be the same problem? But that thread is closed without a clear answer.
Environment info
Operating System:

Tensorflow 1.0.0
Python 2.7
Ubuntu 14.04

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*):
CUDA 8.0
cuDNN 5.1.10
*This problem occurs in both GPU and CPU environment.
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
The following code is to produce a .pb file that can be used for tf.import_graph_def.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util

input_jpeg = tf.placeholder(tf.string, name='DecodeJpeg/contents')
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(input_jpeg, channels=3)
image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)

height = tf.constant(224)
width = tf.constant(224)
input_h = tf.shape(image)[0]
input_w = tf.shape(image)[1]

def resize_t(image_t, h=height, w=width):
  image2 = tf.expand_dims(image_t, axis=0)
  return image2

image_checked = tf.cond(
    (tf.less(input_h, height)), 
    lambda:resize_t(image), lambda:image)

shape_t = tf.shape(image_checked, name='shape_t')

with tf.Session() as sess:
  # freeze the graph and export
  output_graph_def = sess.graph_def
  output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
        sess, sess.graph_def, ['shape_t'])
  output_graph_def = graph_util.remove_training_nodes(output_graph_def)
  with open('out.pb', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())

The out.pb file can be generated as expected, but when I import it using the code below:
import tensorflow as tf
with open('out.pb', 'rb') as f:
  graph_content = f.read()
graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
graph_def.ParseFromString(graph_content)
_ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

It failed with Message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "im.py", line 6, in <module>
    _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/importer.py", line 342, in import_graph_def
    % (input_name,)))
ValueError: graph_def is invalid at node u'cond/ExpandDims/dim': More inputs specified ('cond/Switch:1') than the op expects..

What other attempted solutions have you tried?
when I removed the graph_util.remove_training_nodes call, everything works well.
So it seems that something goes wrong while removing the Identity nodes from the graph.
Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
Exploring the .pbtxt generated with and without graph_util.remove_training_nodes,some Identity nodes are removed and the input of ExpandDims/dim is modified to connect to the output of Switch.(maybe?)
