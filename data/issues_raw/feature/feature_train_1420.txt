Support for double precision complex numbers

I'd like to use TensorFlow to write an application that would need complex128 as a dtype.
But TensorFlow currently only supports complex64.
Are there any plans for supporting complex128 as well in the future?
Seems that there is a TODO for this in  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto#L36.
