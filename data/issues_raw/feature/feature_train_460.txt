Make a helpful python Tensor __repr__ that describes type, shape, etc.

Currently repr(tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(3,1))) gives:
'<tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor object at 0x7fa0e9f99b10>'

This is not very informative and it's what you see as the output for interactive shell (IPython). In contrast to that, repr(np.array([[1,2]])) will give us nice:
'array([[1, 2]])'
