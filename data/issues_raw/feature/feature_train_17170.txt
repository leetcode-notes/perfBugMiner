Describe the problem
The only way to convert a list of feature columns to tensors in TensorFlow 1.5 is by passing them to an input_layer. This would do the per-column conversion and concatenate the resulting tensors. While useful in some cases, this approach is a bit limiting, as it does not allow to

concatenate on an axis different than axis=1 (think sequence data),
extract tensors for the individual columns.

Both limitations can be mitigated by introducing a new public function converting from _FeatureColumn to Tensor (or even from a list of feature columns to a list of tensors). In the latter case, it could just be _internal_input_layer without the concatenation in the end.
What do you think? If this sounds good, I can submit a PR.
