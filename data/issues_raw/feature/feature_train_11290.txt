Restoring SavedModel in //tensorflow/c:c_api_test fails

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version: 'v1.2.1-0-gb4957ff', '1.2.1'
Python version: 2.7.12
Bazel version: 0.4.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: No GPU
GPU model and memory: No GPU
Exact command to reproduce: bazel test //tensorflow/c:c_api_test

The problem:
While executing c_api_test from c module on a big endian machine, it fails while restoring SavedModel(tensorflow/cc/saved_model/testdata/half_plus_two/00000123). There is a warning displayed Reading a bundle with different endianness from the reader.
Similarly, other tests from cc, java module which read this SavedModel from testdata also fail due to endianness mismatch.
What would be appropriate way to handle this failure on big endian?
Is there a way to convert the above SavedModel to Big Endian while reading it in the tests?
