Throw uninitialized local variable error to reduce confusion.

I reference this post.
If one does not call tf.local_variables_initializer() when using tf.train.string_input_producer with num_epochs set as a local variable, it will throw an OutOfRangeError which might mislead people into thinking that the error lies with tf.train.string_input_producer instead of initializing the local variable.
Throwing an uninitialized local variable error would be very helpful in this case.
