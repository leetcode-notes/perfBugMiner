Add sparse tensor support to `tf.data.Dataset`

The tf.data.Dataset class does not currently recognize a tf.SparseTensor object as a component of a dataset element. This makes it difficult to use the full capabilities of SparseTensor-producing ops such as tf.parse_single_example() in Dataset.map() transformations, and then manipulating those elements using operations like Dataset.batch(). The existing tf.train.batch() and related functions for queue-based pipelines support tf.SparseTensor, and we should add support to Dataset for parity.
This Stack Overflow answer suggests some possible workarounds in the meantime.
