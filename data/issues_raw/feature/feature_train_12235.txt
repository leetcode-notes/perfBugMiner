Feature: add safe mode for tf.cast

tf.cast allows to cast float value to int without any warnning. It seems quite unsafe and data will be truncated.
In [34]: tf.__version__
Out[34]: '1.2.1'

In [35]: sess.run(tf.cast(tf.constant(100000, tf.float32), tf.int16
))
Out[35]: -31072
Perhaps  it will be better, like astype in numpy, to add a casting to support both safe and unsafe casting mode.
I can work on it if possible.
