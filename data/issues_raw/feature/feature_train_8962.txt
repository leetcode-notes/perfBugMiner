Graph Collections in the C API

Hi,
In Python we have graph collections (e.g., TRAINABLE_VARIABLES) which are stored in the Graph class. I assume that these are somehow serialized in the graph protobuf so that when a GraphDef is imported, the relevant collections are imported too. However, I do not see any option in the C API for defining such collections? Is there something that I am missing? If not, why not include that functionality in the C API?
Thank you,
Anthony
