[go bindings] Printing graph in a text format

I was looking for a function  that allows me (like in python) to print the graph in a readable way.
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:
Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOs X
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.1.0
Python version: 2.7.13
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
In python i can do:

import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
with tf.gfile.FastGFile("graphname.pb", 'rb') as f:
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    _ = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
    
# All operations
sess.graph.get_operations()
that prints the operations of my graph
In go i just have the option:
graph := tf.NewGraph()
if err := graph.Import(model, ""); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
f, err := os.Create("logWritter.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	graph.WriteTo(f)

it prints the binary graph.
Describe the problem
When using a model, previously trained by somebody else, it is very useful to know the nodes to reference them.  It should be nice to have the same option with go.
