Feature request: add operators support in tflite : ExpandDims, Prod, Slice

i have my own network trained, and when i want to convert it to tflite mode, the toco gives my the error:
2018-02-27 16:57:12.122124: I tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/allocate_transient_arrays.cc:313] Total transient array allocated size: 103680 bytes, theoretical optimal value: 103680 bytes.
2018-02-27 16:57:12.122280: F tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/tflite/export.cc:303] Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: ExpandDims, Prod, Slice.
Aborted (core dumped)
for slice(for example, to change the tf.slice to [n:m] operator), i have tried several way but none of them work.
