[feature] "Periodic" mode for tf.pad

Describe the problem
If I have a matrix
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]

It would be nice if I could use something like tf.pad( ... 'PERIODIC') to pad around the dimensions to get a matrix like
[ [9, 7, 8, 9, 7],
  [3, 1, 2, 3, 1],
  [6, 4, 5, 6, 4],
  [9, 7, 8, 9, 7],
  [3, 1, 2, 3, 1] ]

While there seems to be a work around by manually slicing and joining, this would seem nifty to have in tf.pad already to make expressions that assume periodic boundary conditions a bit easier.
