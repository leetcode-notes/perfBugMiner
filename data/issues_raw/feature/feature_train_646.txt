Can't call shuffle_batch with a boolean tensor

tf.bool is not a valid dtype for tensors passed to tf.train.shuffle_batch (or most queues, I think)
I'm porting a data input pipeline to tensorflow, but doing it a little differently than the seq2seq tutorials. I have variable-length sequential data that I pad in pre-processing, while also generating a boolean mask for the valid entries. However, I can't store the mask in a tf.bool tensor because that breaks the queue system.
