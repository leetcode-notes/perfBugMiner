tf.unravel_index (Was: tf.argmin across all dimensions)

Hi,
tf.argmin only works in one dimension.
Let's say I have a picture which is a 2x2 array of pixels (each pixels is a 3 value array) and I want to know which pixel is closest to a certain color. In that case I have to reshape the 2x2 array to a 1-D array then get the min index, then find out that index to what 2x2 array position corresponds.
Couldn't I just as tensorflow to give me the index in the 2x2 array. For instance [1,15]?
I really don't understand the reason for having to translate between lineal index and array location all the time.
Thanks.
