Feature request: easier access to all variables inside a scope

Right now, in order to access the variables inside a scope, AFAIK we have to do the following:
variables = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES, scope)

It would be far easier if we could just write
variables = scope.get_all_variables()

or maybe
variables = tf.get_scope_variables(scope)

Is it a reasonable request?
