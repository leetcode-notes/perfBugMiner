gradients for assign/tf.scatter_update, etc

Hello,
I was wondering whether there is a specific reason for tf.assign not having gradients.
I think that it would make sense that tf.assign, i.e. a call of the form variable.assign(value) "inherits" the gradients from value, such that grad(variable) = grad(value), after the assignment.
This would be especially useful within the context of the scatter-update functions, since those are one of the most convenient ways to avoid indexing and do partial updates of variables.
If there are cases where this is not required, assign could maybe take an argument that allows this, such as "inherit_gradients", or some such, do not break compatibility.
Thank you!
