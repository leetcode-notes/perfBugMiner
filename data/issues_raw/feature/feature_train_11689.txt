Distributed Tensorflow Authorization

Could somebody comment on the security design of distributed tensorflow?
Is there some kind of authorization in place for the grpc calls in distributed tensorflow?
E.g., are the clients validated based on the IP or anything else?
If not, how difficult would it be to add authorization support and what would be the best place in the code to get started?
