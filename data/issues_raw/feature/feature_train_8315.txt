[feature]: support for trigonometric functions in XLA

I'd like to request support for basic trigonometric functions in XLA, things like cos, sin, etc, as well as basic geometry options like cross products. These are already supported in TF and I imagine there's native support in eigen. Looking through tf2xla I didn't see them anywhere.
