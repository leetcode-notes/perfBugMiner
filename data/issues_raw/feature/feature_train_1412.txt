resize_image_with_crop_or_pad() on variable image sizes

I'm setting up what (I think) should be a straightforward image loading pipeline:
decoded_image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(value)
resized_image = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(decoded_image, width, height)
However, I get an error 'image' must be fully defined. - the image not being fully defined because the size of the JPEG is variable. When using the tf.image.resize_images() function, it seems that this constraint is not enforced. Is it necessary to have fixed image dimensions to use the resize_image_with_crop_or_pad() function? That would seem to somewhat defeat the point of an auto-crop/resizing function, no?
