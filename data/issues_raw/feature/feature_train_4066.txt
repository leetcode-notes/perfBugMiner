retrying_file_system does not use exponential backoff

In tensorflow-0.10.0rc0/tensorflow/core/platform/cloud/retrying_file_system.cc,
the retry logic does not insert a delay between successive attempts.
Status CallWithRetries(const std::function<Status()>& f) {
int attempts = 0;
while (true) {
attempts++;
auto status = f();
if (!IsRetriable(status) || attempts >= kMaxAttempts) {
return status;
}
LOG(ERROR) << "The operation resulted in an error and will be retried: "
<< status.ToString();
}
}
