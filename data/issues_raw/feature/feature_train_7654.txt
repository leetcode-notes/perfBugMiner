Feature: Tensorboard Starts with all Runs Toggled Off Initially

Currently the initial load /  full page refresh of tensorboard starts on the scalars tab with all runs toggled on for rendering. If there are a lot of runs in the logdir, the browser hangs for a noticeable period of time while all of the charts for the runs are rendered. I suggest making the initial load have runs off and letting the user opt in / turn on the desired set of runs.
