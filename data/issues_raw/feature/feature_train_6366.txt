Make VLOG minimum level can be updated via environment

I found inside c++ core implementation there're lots of verbose messages like:
    VLOG(1) << "Direct session inter op parallelism threads: " << num_threads;

They will be very helpful for developer to understand what happens internally and troubleshoot problems.
However I found in implementation, it doesn't look like works without changing the code. (Credit to @yaroslavvb for the solution, see discussion thread: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/discuss/D0_3jG5_XRQ)
    // TODO(jeff): Define a proper implementation of VLOG_IS_ON
    #define VLOG_IS_ON(lvl) ((lvl) <= 0)

    #define VLOG(lvl)      \
        if (VLOG_IS_ON(lvl)) \
          ::tensorflow::internal::LogMessage(__FILE__, __LINE__, tensorflow::INFO)

It will be very helpful if we can update the minimum lvl via passing environment.
