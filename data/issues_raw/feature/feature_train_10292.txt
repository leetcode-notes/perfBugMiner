FEATURE: Label scalar summaries

Often I log scalar summaries at intervals that are meaningful in their own right — e.g. at epochs or min-batch boundaries — and report this, rather than the global step, as the x-value with something like
some_writer.add_summary(a_value, epoch_number)

or
some_writer.add_summary(a_value, batch_number)

But the API has no way of indicating that these x-values are not "steps", and reports them in the TensorBoard UI as "Steps", which they are not.
It would be nice to have a way of changing the "Steps" label to some other string (here, for example "Epoch" or "Batch").
