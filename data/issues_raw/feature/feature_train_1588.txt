Slicing sparse tensor

There does not appear to be a way to extract a (sparse or dense) slice from a sparse tensor in the same manner as there is from a dense tensor. Will this be a feature in the future, or is it already present and I'm just missing something? Perhaps it should be added to the planned improvements for indexing.
