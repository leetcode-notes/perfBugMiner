Support multi-processing on tf.py_func

This would be a great feature to have. The tf.py_func op is very handy for certain custom operations, but when training on multiple GPUs it ends up becoming a bottleneck that slows everything down. One way to get around that is to allow tf.py_fun to run on a different process each time, and by doing so avoid the GIL bottleneck. This could be enabled only when stateful = False, to avoid unintended side effects.
