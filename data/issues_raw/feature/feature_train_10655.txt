Feature Request: Add an optional command-line argument for a prefix URL

Would like to add a command-line argument that allows TensorBoard to run at a different URL location than the root domain.  So for example:

command-line: --base_url runhere
URL location: http://<address>:6006/runhere/

Motivation for request: There are locations where only minimal ports are open and it would be great to use nginx (or similar) to route TensorBoard through port 80.
