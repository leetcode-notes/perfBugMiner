New Feature: 4D Tensor Input for LSTM RNN Neural Network

Currently TF RNN LSTM accepts this tensor rank:   (ht, mt)  of rank 1
 (ht_o, mt_o) = LSTM(ht, mt, W)
 with   ht size is (1 to d)   ,  same for mt

Would it be possible to accept rank 2 or rank 3 for the input state of RNN LSTM
ht size  (1 to m, 1 to s, 1 to d)      : Rank 3
It would allows Multi-dimensionnal input such as :
Input  size  (NSample, Mtype, Nchar, Nsequence)
Especially, it makes sense for Grid LSTM.
