[feature] sparse_reduce_max and sparse_reduce_max_sparse

Hi guys,
Currently we work on sparse tensors, and we are missing some sparse operations. Is there any way you could add sparse_reduce_max and sparse_reduce_max_sparse operations as functions equivalent to existing tf.sparse_reduce_sum and tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse but with max operation as reducing function?
Thank you,
Joanna
