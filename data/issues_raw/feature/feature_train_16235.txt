Feature Request: Make NDLSTM use state_is_tuple=True

I have successfully used NDLSTM (specifically lstm2d.separable_lstm) in my own project but whenever I use it, I enocunter this warning: "Using a concatenated state is slower and will soon be deprecated. use state_is_tuple=true."
The warning is caused by  ndlstm_base_dynamic in lstm1d.py. Specifically, this line: lstm_cell = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(noutput, state_is_tuple=False)
I modified the code such that the deprecation warning won't appear:
with variable_scope.variable_scope(scope, "SeqLstm", [inputs]):
    lstm_cell = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(noutput)
    if reverse:
      inputs = array_ops.reverse_v2(inputs, [0])
    outputs, _ = rnn.dynamic_rnn(
        lstm_cell, inputs, time_major=True, dtype=inputs.dtype)
    if reverse:
      outputs = array_ops.reverse_v2(outputs, [0])
    return outputs

Before I make any pull requests, is there a reason why the state_is_tuple argument is set to False in the code?
