Better control of logging verbosity

I'm creating a simple LSTM in Keras, and during training I get these warnings:

I know I can set the TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL according to this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35869137/avoid-tensorflow-print-on-standard-error
or use the tf.logging.set_verbosity(verbosity) to control this, but for my example I would like to

Hide the warnings that Tensorflow wasn't compiled to use ... instructions.
Show the logging of device when starting a new session, that is very useful to confirm that the GPU support is working.
Hide the Pool allocator warnings since they clutter the console output from Keras during training.

I haven't found a way to do this, perhaps it could be added as a feature?
