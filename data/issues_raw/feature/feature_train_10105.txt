Feature request: polarized gradient in tensorboard embeddings

Currently, default tensorboard color gradient goes from light yellow to dark blue (see screenshot), which works great for highlighting positive values (yellow dots become nearly invisible).
But it doesn't work well for displaying, let's say, sentiment scales (going from -1 to +1). The ability to choose a gradient going from red to blue would be helpful for visualizing polarized scales.
