Feature request: directional distributions (like von Mises-Fisher)

Are there plans to implement directional statistical distributions? In particular, I'm looking to get a von Mises-Fisher distribution into contrib/distributions/python.
I'm beginning work on a VMF distribution myself, but as a new TF user my progress is likely to be slow.
(Note that scipy.stats implements a basic von Mises distribution.)
