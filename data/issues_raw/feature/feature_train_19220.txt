upsampling op for 5-D tensor with shape [batch, height, width, depth, channels] (feature request)

My target is 3D medical image.
For 4-D tensor B with shape [batch, height, width, channels] use tf.image.resize_* for upsampling.
For 5-D tensor A with shape [batch, height, width, depth, channels], tf.nn.conv3d_transpose can be used for upsampling, but I don't want extra weights for training.
Is there an direct op for this? instead of


Note: This seem to be wrong !
[batch, height, width, depth, channels] = tf.shape(A)
A1 = tf.reshape(A, [batch, height, width * depth, channels])
A2 = tf.image.resize_bilinear(A1, [2 * height, 4 * width * depth])
A3 = tf.reshape(A2, [batch, 2 * height, 2 * width, 2 * depth, channels]


split the last dimension -> reshape -> resize_bilinear -> reshape -> concat.


tf.nn.con3d_transpose()
