Feature request: Add float16 support for Conv3D, MaxPool3D and AvgPool3D ops

Support for tf.float16 dtype was recently added (#1300) to a bunch of ops. Can we add it for conv3d too, please?
conv3d is important to development of videos and medical images systems. Since both consumes a lot of memory, it would be good to have fp16 support to allow deeper models.
