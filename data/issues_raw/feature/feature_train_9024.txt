Tensorboard to Latex

It would be nice if there was an export option in tensorboard that would export a latex-ready version of the visible graph - perhaps using SVG, Pgfplots or something similar. It's possible now to export CSV, and create the graphic by hand... but having it baked into tensorboard would be nice.
