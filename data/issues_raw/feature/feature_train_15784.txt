[FeatureRequest] Support PathLike objects for directory arguments

With python 3.6, PEP 519 and the pathlib module, it would be great if TensorFlow directory parameters accepted PathLike objects.
From the Backwards Compatibility part of the documentation, a suggested implementation is:
path.__fspath__() if hasattr(path, "__fspath__") else path
With such an implementation, it seems path in the code above can be any file system representation of str, bytes or pathlib.Path. For my case, I was using/looking at the tf.estimator.model_dir parameter, but for consistency I assume it would also need applying in all cases where a path is accepted such as tf.gfile

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-8-gbca50da6eb 1.4.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

Describe the problem
Problem is the pathlib module represents filesystem paths although is not accepted in parameters that refer to a directory or file in the TensorFlow API. The proposed feature would enable accepting these objects while still maintaining compatibility with existing str type paths.
