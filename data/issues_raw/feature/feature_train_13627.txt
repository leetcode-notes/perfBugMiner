HDFS user impersonation

TensorFlow  does support HDFS filesystem but there is no way to specify as which user to access the filesystem.
The native hdfs library provides a function to set the user name, hdfsBuilderSetUserName() similar to hdfsBuilderSetNameNode(). There is also hdfsConnectAsUser() where you can specify the user, builds the hdfsBuilder struct, set the username among other arguments and return the FileSystem handle.
Currently I don't see any way to provide a username in TensorFlow and more specifically in tensorflow/core/platform/hadoop/hadoop_file_system.cc
I suppose that something like the following would be sufficient.
