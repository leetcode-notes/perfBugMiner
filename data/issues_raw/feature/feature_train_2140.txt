Feature request: support symbolic links for tensorboard

It would be nice if one could use symbolic links to organize groups of training files. Tensorboard does not search over symbolic links for event files because the following line 178 of python/summary/event_multiplexer.py:
subdirs = [
        subdir
        for (subdir, files) in io_wrapper.ListRecursively(path)
        if list(filter(event_accumulator.IsTensorFlowEventsFile, files))
]
does not walk across symbolic links. This would be easy to fix by adding a symlink option to ListRecursively().
Current difficulties:


Over time, the number of distinct training runs in a directory can grow to over 10, at which point tensorboard becomes slow and too information rich. Reorganizing a subset with symbolic links would be quite nice.


Sometimes it would be nice to compare a small subset of training runs that exist in different directories. Copying these files with cp -r is quite slow.
