Feature request: Multi-label Binarizer (k-hot)

Hi, I feel like an array op that converts between iterable of iterables and a multi-label format would be useful for preprocessing in multi-label tasks. Basically a tensorflow version of a sklearn MultiLabelBinarizer that can iterate through Tensors.
I would assume a tf.one_hot() modification can work.
Thanks.
