Describe the problem
tf documentation

Returns a set of windows called glimpses extracted at location offsets from the input tensor. If the windows only partially overlaps the inputs, the non overlapping areas will be filled with random noise.

the function tf.image.extract_glimpse padds windows that reach outside of the input tensor with random values from either a Gaussian or a normal distribution.
However this prevents consistent classification in some cases.
Would it be possible to add the option of specifying a fixed padding value (i.e. zero padding)?
