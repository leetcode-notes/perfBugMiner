Feature request: Allow import of incomplete graphs

It seems like there is no reason in principle not to allow this:
import tensorflow as tf

g=tf.Graph()
with g.as_default():
    x = tf.constant(1.0, name="x")
    y = tf.exp(x)
g_def=tf.GraphDef()
g_def.node.extend([y.op.node_def])

g2 = tf.Graph()
with g2.as_default():
    x = tf.constant(2.0, name="x")
    tf.import_graph_def(g_def)

as, after y is imported, the x:0 input it refers to is valid.
As it stands however, this throws ValueError: graph_def is invalid at node u'Exp': Input tensor 'x:0' not found in graph_def...
