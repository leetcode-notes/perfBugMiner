Feature request: document which inputs have gradients

For most operations, the documentation does not make clear what gradients are implemented. Including this information for the inputs (e.g. annotating the inputs that do not have gradients implemented) would help the user better understand the resulting graph.
It appears a related issue was closed, as it was not a feature request. #6025
