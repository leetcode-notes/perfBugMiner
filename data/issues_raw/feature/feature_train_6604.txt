add summary_feed_dict support to tf.train.Supervisor

Example use case:

We want to use tf.summary.image on a (computed) tensor which requires a feed_dict of some input tensor.

Current work around:

Manage summary_op manually (inside training loop). Cannot use any higher level training helper.

I could also provide a PR on interest.
