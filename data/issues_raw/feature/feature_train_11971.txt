API request: MonitoredSession.run_without_hooks

Currently it is not possible to run a MonitoredSession without also calling the before_run and after_run methods of session hooks. But sometimes it is necessary. For example, I want to modify certain variables in the graph, but sometimes the SummarySaverHook decides it is time to collect summary, right when I am loading new values into the dependent variables, and then Tensorboad shows inconsistent results.
A run_without_hooks method will be immensely helpful.
