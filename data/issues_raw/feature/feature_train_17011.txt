[Feature Request] Specify output size for tf.contrib.image.transform

Status Quo
Right now the output size of tf.contrib.image.transform is equal to the input size.
Request
Specify output size for tf.contrib.image.transform by argument.
Usage example:
This would be very useful for custom augmentations where the input images do not have a fixed size, but the output images shall have a constant size. This operation can be simulated by padding the input images (such that no information is lost when e.g. rotation the image), then transforming them and finally cropping/padding them to the desired size, but it'd be much more efficient and a lot easier if the op could support setting the desired output size.
Thanks!
