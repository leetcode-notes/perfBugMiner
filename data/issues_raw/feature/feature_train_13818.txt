Feature request: C API "TF_FinishWhile" should create a "WhileContextDef"

Thanks @skye et al for getting while loops into the C API!
I'd like to request that TF_FinishWhile generate a WhileContextDef protobuf object. That way, non-Python TensorFlow clients can create metagraphs involving while loops which the Python client can then import and take gradients of. Ideally, you could gradients of while loops directly in the C API, but I think just creating the while context should be much easier and is a good stop gap on the way there.
