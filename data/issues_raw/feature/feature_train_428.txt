Support more image formats

Hello
Forgive me if Ive missed something obvious - new to Tensorflow / machine learning.
I notice there are image creation functions which deal with JPG and PNG image creation via parsing those formats.
Is it planned to support uncompressed images? Client applications may want to decompress video frames and use them for analysis.
Perhaps I am missing a way to construct a tensor from an uncompressed byte array? How would one handle some video optimization for byte alignment / stride etc?
If there is a more appropriate place to ask beginner questions I am happy to take the conversation there. Thank you!
