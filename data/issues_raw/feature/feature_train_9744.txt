Adding a random seed parameter for tensorflow.layer.dense

Hi,
I noticed that the tensorflow.layer.dense wrapper does not have a seed parameter, and I was wondering what you think about adding one. E.g., this seed would be used to initialize the random weights and bias units (if they are not initialized to zero).
Related to the points above,  it is currently also not clear how the weights are initialized. I.e., what distribution the random numbers are drawn from (if not zero). Does someone have some info on this? -- maybe this could be added to the API docs.
What do you think? (I am happy to contribute a random seed implementation and a doc update if that's desirable.)
