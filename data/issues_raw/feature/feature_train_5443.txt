einsum with ellipses "..." (indefinite number of axes)

Thank you very much for providing the (numpy) einsum feature in tensorflow, that is really great. The documentation for einsum says to look at the numpy documentation as it provides the same api. It is not exactly the same, one difference is the possibility of using "..." in numpy which seems not to be implemented in tensorflow. This would definitely be a nice feature to have in tensorflow also since that way one could build various function/transformations in tensorflow which are not dependent on the number of axis the tensor has (i.e. the specific use case).
Here is the error I encountered when trying to do that:
d = tf.einsum("i...,ij->j...",c,b)


AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
