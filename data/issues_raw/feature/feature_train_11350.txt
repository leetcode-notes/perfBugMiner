MonitoredTrainingSession to have accessible summary writer.

Tensorflow version: 1.2.1
I am using MonitoredTrainingSession extensively to train models, and for the most part does exactly what I want it to do. However, I would like to be able to extract (or pass in) a FileWriter object so I can report other summaries from inside my evaluation routines. This is because only oneFileWriter can write to the events log:
At the moment, this is the best workaround I can do:
sess = tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(
       ...
    )

# HACK: this is so we use the same summary writer obj for both summaries, only way to do it.
summary_writer = sess._hooks[1]._summary_writer
Then I can use the summary_writer to manually report summaries in the evaluation part of my code:
mean_test_loss = ...
summary = tf.Summary(value=[
    tf.Summary.Value(tag='mean_test_loss', simple_value=mean_test_loss)
])
summary_writer.add_summary(summary, current_step)

It would be nice to have a non-hacky way to get the summary_writer from the session so only one FileWriter writes to the events file.
One thought I had is to have a FileWriter object as part of the Scaffold that is used to build the session. That way anyone can get hold of the scaffold and use the one summary_writer designated to write to the events log.
I would be happy to help implementing this if other people are interested.
