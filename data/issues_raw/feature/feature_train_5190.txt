tf.self_adjoint_eig does not work for complex matrices

The documentation of tf.self_adjoint_eig (and the likes) does not state that which data types are accepted by this function. Turns out, only float32 and float64. But the name is misleading: self-adjointness is a property of complex matrices, and one could expect that this function would work on complex64 and complex128 as well.
For me it would be very useful if tf.self_adjoint_eig could work for complex matrices.
Please amend the documentation with the list of accepted dtypes (this goes for SVD and other similar functions as well). And of course it would be great if tf.self_adjoint_eig could accept complex data. :)
