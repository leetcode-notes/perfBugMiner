3D Convolutions not being forwarded to MKL

This is a placeholder reminder for the Tensorflow/Intel team.  I'm in touch with Toby Boyd and Intel on this issue, I just want it to be in the databasase.
When compiling for MKL (--config=mkl) 3D convolutions remain in native Eigan. This strongly impacts a 3D medical application that needs to run inferencing on an edge device.

System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 7


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source


TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.2.0rc0


Python version:
2.7


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
0.5.2


CUDA/cuDNN version:
n/a


GPU model and memory:
n/a


Exact command to reproduce:
Follow standard bazel build, say "yes" for MKL, build  wheel with --config=mkl. and install with pip
