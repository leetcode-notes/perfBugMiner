Add a lite version of libtensorflow-core to Makefile

The tensorflow iOS libraries created by the makefile have a very large footprint ( > 90 MB ).
To help reduce the size of apps, there should also be a lite version of the libraries, possibly based on the Bazel android_tensorflow_lib_lite target.
Note that Apple prevents apps larger than 100 MB from being downloaded over the air.
