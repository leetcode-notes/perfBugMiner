Describe the problem
Currently tf.cond does not work if predicate is a Python boolean. As a result, people frequently have to write conditional statements twice, one with if statement, and one with tf.cond call. There is a smart_cond in tensorflow/python/layers/utils.py, but it is not in the public API or searchable in documentation. Petition to make it public or just integrate the smartness in tf.cond altogether. It is not a big change and will not impact backwards compatibility.
