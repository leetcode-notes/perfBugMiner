tf.einsum fails on evaluation in some cases

Hello,
I was a user of 'reshape-matmul-reshape' approach, however it felt me a bit messy, so I am trying some alternatives that do this automatically.
I had tried tf.tensordot before, however it did not work well when shapes are partially known (#6682).
As an alternative, I tried to use tf.einsum.
However, similar to tf.tensordot, it cannot handle some variables with partially-known-shape, for instance, the below codes fails on evaluation.
a = tf.placeholder('float32', shape=[None, None, 100])
b = tf.placeholder('float32', shape=[100, 300])
result_einsum = tf.einsum('ijk,kl->ijl', a, b)
a_value = np.random.randn(10, 20, 100)
b_value = np.random.randn(100, 300)
sess.run(result_einsum, {a: a_value, b: b_value})  # failure

This is the error message:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): only one input size may be -1, not both 0 and 1
         [[Node: Reshape_5 = Reshape[T=DT_FLOAT, Tshape=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](MatMul_3, Reshape_5/shape)]]
