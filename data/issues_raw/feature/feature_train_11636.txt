stack bidirectional RNNs: swap_memory and time_major args

Feature Request
adding swap_memory and time_major arguments to stack_bidirectional_rnn and stack_bidirectional_dynamic_rnn
from the source i see that both stack_bidirectional function just wraps bidirectional_rnn so it use concatenated output as next bidirectional layer's input. is it intentional that swap_memory and time_major argument not added?
