Feature request: other types of padding besides zero-padding.

I would like to have other options of padding for tf.pad and convolution ops.
Some types that come to my mind right now:

reflect
constant value (other than zero)
maybe implement other options of numpy.pad: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html
