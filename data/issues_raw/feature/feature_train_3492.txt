Dilated Convolution, Dilated Pooling and 2D/3D Sliding Window CNNs

Could you please implement 2D/3D dilated convolution and 2D/3D dilated pooling in tensorflow?
Please see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07122.pdf for a reference on dilated convolution.
Dilated max-pooling is simply regular max-pooling but the pixels/voxels you use in each "application" of the max-pooling operation are exactly the same pixels/voxels you would select with dilated convolution.
Dilated convolution/pooling are useful for connectomics and 3D shape datasets (3D deep learning).
