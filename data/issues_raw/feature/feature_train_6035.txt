Error message for running tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax() on CPU

Running tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax() on CPU gives a very obscure error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'MaxPoolWithArgmax' with these attrs. Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:  
From this line:

I think it's useful to mention tf.nn.max_pool_with_argmax() is only implemented for GPU instead.
