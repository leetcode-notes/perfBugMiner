Rename parameter in Exponential distribution

Current
distributions.Exponential(lam=2.0)
I had to think a bit before figuring out that lam stands for lambda. Following the MLP book I think a better name would be rate or average_rate.

This distribution describes the times between events in a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate lambda

distributions.Exponential(rate=2.0)
Numpy uses another parameterization: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.exponential.html
