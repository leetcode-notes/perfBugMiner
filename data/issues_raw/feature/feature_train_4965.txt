Feature request: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), also known as Hybrid Monte Carlo, is an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that exploits gradient information to improve on the simpler MCMC methods. See this freely available book chapter by Radford Neal:

It has been successfully applied to Bayesian inference in Neural Networks, again  by Neal. See for instance Neal's thesis which later became a book:

HMC is heavily used in modern Bayesian modelling, For instance, HMC and its variants are the primary inference method for Stan, a popular probabilistic programming language:

It would be useful to be able to use HMC in TensorFlow much as one is currently able to use Optimizers such as Adam or Momentum optimization. Much of the requisite code would be similar to the optimizer code which can be found here:

I've raised this feature request as a place to discuss the potential addition of HMC to TensorFlow.
