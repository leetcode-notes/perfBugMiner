Status of Allocator API

Making this issue to track status of allocator C API, based on discussion at tfdev conference: cc @josh11b @vrv @skye @keveman @zheng-xq @keveman @yuanbyu
Currently allocator API is not public. This API, in tensorflow/core/framework/allocator.h, and more specifically, bytes_in_use, is currently the only practical way to implement user ops that

Decide what to do based on available memory (like foldr, map_fn, with swap_memory=True option)
Report available memory to user (#7537)

The three options are:

Make this API public
Keep this API non-public, but make it possible to create a user-op that uses this API.
Keep this API non-public and do not provide a way to use it from user-op.

Currently it's somewhere between 2 and 3. API is not public and you can build user-op like memory_probe_op with gcc, but not with Bazel. From an op-creator standpoint, 1 is preferable to 2 and 2 is preferable to 3.
Similar issue was #1419 where people tried to make a custom reader user op that uses methods from reader_base.h. The final solution was the opposite -- it was possible to make work with bazel (by commenting out disallowed_deps line), but not with gcc.
