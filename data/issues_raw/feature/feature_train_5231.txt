[FEATURE REQUEST] More than 2D matmul

Hello!
I just would like to know if high dimensional matmul will be supported in the future?
For example, I have a 3D tensor a and a matrix b as below:
a = [[[1,1],
         [1,1]],
        [[2,2],
         [2,2]]]
b = [[1,1], [1,1]]
In numpy, np.dot(a, b) will return
[[[2,2],
   [2,2]],
  [[4,4],
    [4,4]]]
But in tensorflow tf.matmul only supports 2D * 2D.
Actually using tf.conv2d and reshaping can do the same thing,  it would be more natural that tf.matmul could do as well. And such operators frequently occurr in NLP tasks like attention or memory network.
Forgive my offense and really thanks for any help
