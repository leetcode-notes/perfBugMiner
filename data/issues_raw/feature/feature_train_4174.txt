tf.nn.bias_add does not support multiple derivatives (using with contrib.learn)

Apparently, tf.nn.bias_add does not support differentiating twice: I created a neural network with tf.contrib.layers, and attempting to compute a Hessian matrix (actually Hessian-vector product, based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_automatic_differentiation) yields a LookupError saying that BiasAddGrad has no gradient.
From what I understand, bias_add is basically add with support for different types.
Is there any way to allow bias_add to be differentiated multiple times? Perhaps at the very least we could make the use of bias_add optional in layers.
