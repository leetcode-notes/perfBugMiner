[suggestion][tf.estimator] model with multiple labels

How about let labels provided to def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params): be dict but not a tensor.
I'm now modeling a model with multiple outputs to be optimized, however, I can only use features to substitute labels because it only allow a tensor. I'm using version 1.4
