Give a convenient way to retrieve shadow variables created by ExponentialMovingAverage.

At first I was under the impression, the variables returned by tf.moving_average_variables() would be shadow variables created, but that does not seem to be the case (they didn't save/restore correctly for me).
Now that I'm reading the code, that seems to be the intention, though? Shouldn't this line read
ops.add_to_collection(ops.GraphKeys.MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES, avg)

?
If not, it would be great to save the averages under some other key and make them easily retrievable for the saver in a similar way as tf.moving_average_variables(), maybe as  tf.moving_average_shadow_variables().
