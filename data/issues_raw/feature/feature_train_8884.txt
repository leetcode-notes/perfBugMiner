8-bit quantized atrous conv2d op not supported

It looks like that 8-bit quantized atrous conv2d op is not supported. As per the latest API,  there are only 4 quantized ops supported namely quantized_conv2d, quantized_relu_x, quantized_max_pool and quantized_avg_pool.  Any target date by which 8-bit atrous conv2d op will be available?
