Use freeze_graph only with an input checkpoint

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 17.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.0-rc0

freeze_graph method from tensorflow.python.tools should be able to work just with an input checkpoint, it needn't a graph definition from a protobuf file. Just restoring the metagraph and using the graph from the session lets you get rid of the graph def file.
Also, as you have provided from 1.2.0-rc0 a method to freeze from code without loading the files (freeze_graph_with_def_protos), it should be able to work without a checkpoint but just with a session.
These will make freezing way simpler.
