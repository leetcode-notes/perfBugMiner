Reduction Functionality for Java API

Hey! It seems like the reduction functionality available in Python (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/math_ops/reduction) has not made it to the Java API. Are there plans to port it over yet? There are some useful functions such as reduce_mean which I need.
