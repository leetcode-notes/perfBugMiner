[Feature Request] Inverse Functions: Auto-Solve similar to Auto-Grad?

Would it be possible to implement some type of automatic equation solving?
E.g. f(x, y) = z => tf.solve(y) = f'(x, z)
Functions like tf.sigmoid have known inverse functions which could be used to solve functions if all other parameters are known.
I'm thinking of something like simplified SymPy solvers:
