Suggestion: adding Tags or descriptions to the run log

Hi!
So far, I I have to say that TensorBoard is a really great tool to analyze the training procedure.
However, I often find myself comparing various runs and wondering "wait, which version of my code was that and which parameters did I use?".
Currently, the only way to "document" a Run is the name of the log directory - so I find myself encoding all kinds of cryptic acronyms into the directory name.
What would be really awesome is some sort of feature that allows the training scripts to pass Data to the TensorBoard logs. This could be in any form, maybe as sort of "tags" or as key-value pairs, or simply as a plain old string called "description" or something.
Is this something that sounds useful to others as well? Is this feasible?
