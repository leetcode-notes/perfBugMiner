Tensorflow - Metal Support for Mac OS

Hello!
I have seen and read some requests for OpenCL support and GPU support on Mac OS, this seems to have been abandoned, am I correct?
But it also seems like Apple is really trying to make Metal big, is this something you have thought of implementing? I understand its not just made by thinking of it, but I would just like to know if any progress is made with GPU support for Mac OS?
