Where is tf.layers.flatten?

I hope this question is considered suitable for asking here on GitHub rather than StackOverflow as it relates to a possibly missing feature of the TensorFlow API. I apologize beforehand if I am wasting your time.
This concerns TensorFlow 1.1.0 and tf.layers
The tutorial on tf.layers uses manual reshaping to get from 4-rank to 2-rank tensors (search for the word flatten):
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers
This is not very elegant and I would prefer to use a flatten() function.
The documentation for tf.layers.dense() says something about flattening the input, but it apparently does something else, as discussed in other threads #8175 and #9043
There does not seem to be any tf.layers.flatten() function, see e.g. the API docs:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers
Although there is one for tf.contrib.layers.flatten() as shown here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/flatten
I wonder if flatten() has been omitted for some reason when moving layers to TF core (why?) or perhaps it has been moved somewhere else, but I have searched and I cannot find it anywhere?
Furthermore, I would like to ask if I can expect that tf.layers is going to be the standard builder API going forward? Or will you focus on Keras instead? I have previously used PrettyTensor. There is also tf.slim and other builder APIs. I don't want to change builder API every 6 months, so I'd like to know what the TF developers are betting on this time?
