tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec doesn't have evaluation_hooks parameter

I planned to visualize the evaluation result in tensorboard. Therefore I need to create the evaluation_hook using tf.train.SummarySaverHook in model_fn, and pass it into the EstimatorSpec.
However, EstimatorSpec doesn't accept evaluation_hooks for now. It only has training_hooks. Will evaluation_hooks be added in future versions?
