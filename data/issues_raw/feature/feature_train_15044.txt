rolling window batch operation for tf.data.Dataset

This is a feature request
For Datasets that represent a sequence or time series, it can be useful to have a Dataset op that creates a rolling window batch over the given Dataset. For example, if I have a tf.data.Dataset whose elements represent a time series (line breaks separate elements):
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

The rolling window batch would create a dataset with the following elements (for window size 4 and stride 1):
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
6 7 8 9

This operation will be extremely useful for extracting sub sequences from a time series for training RNNs and Reinforcement Learning models.
