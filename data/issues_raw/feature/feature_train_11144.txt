MultiRNNCell cannot stack PhasedLSTMCell

System information
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2
Describe the problem
tf.contrib.rnn.PhasedLSTMCell takes a tuple of tensors as inputs (time and features).
but the tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell reuse the output of a cell to feed the next one:
cur_inp, new_state = cell(cur_inp, cur_state)
Source code / logs
Something like that works.

<     cur_inp = inputs

>     times = inputs[0]
>     cur_inp = inputs[1]

<         cur_inp, new_state = cell(cur_inp, cur_state)
---
>         cur_inp, new_state = cell((times, cur_inp), cur_state)

Not sure whether it is a bug report or a feature request (for a dedicated MultiPhasedLSTMCell) though...
