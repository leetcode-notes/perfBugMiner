User-defined functions loaders

I noticed user-defined functions are still experimental. I have an idea about functions loaders that could allow us to use dynamically loaded functions from different sources.
Format of function address would be multiaddr-like.
/<loader>/<namespace>/<function>

Loaders can be embed into tensorflow like kernels.
/tf/custom
/core/add
