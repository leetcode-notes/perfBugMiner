[Feature Request] Automatic node placement

I read tensorflow white papaer and found node placement which allocates graph nodes to devices without manual configuration.

However, this post says this feature was removed because it did not perform well.
I think that automatic allocating graph nodes to devices for optimizing parallel execution is necessary to fully use distributed tensorflow.
Do you have the plan to add this feature in the future tensorflow?
