Feature request: separable convolutions in 3D

I would like a tf.nn.separable_conv3d identical to tf.nn.separable_conv2d except with separability between dimentions [1,2,3] and 4, for use with 3D CNNs.
Rationale: separable convolutions perform very well in 2D (see: Xception architecture https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357 ).  In 3D, the number of parameters grows even faster for non-separable convolutions, so the reduction in parameters from using separable convolutions would be relatively even bigger.  This is one of the reasons 3D networks tend to have a simpler architecture than 2D.
Necessity: There doesn't seem to be any way to implement this other than in the TF core. (Suggestions?)
