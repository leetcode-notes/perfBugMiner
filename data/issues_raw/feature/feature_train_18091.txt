Implement faster resampling for tf.data

This method leverages an observation: if we allow ourselves to either sample from a filtered distribution OR the original distribution, we can reduce the amount of data rejected during rejection sampling.  I implemented this 'conditional filtering' in a sort-of hacky way by internally creating an iterator and sticking it in a tf.cond branch. Feedback from a tf.data expert would be great.
I also added unit tests to verify that the new sampler works and is faster than the original, and I added benchmarks.
Tested:
