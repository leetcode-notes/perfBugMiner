Get all placeholders of the graph

According to this:, there are two ways to get placeholders of the graph.
However, neither of them are very convenient.
When I reuse a pretrained model, it is common to inspect the shape of all placeholders. But there is no API to get all placeholders easily.
Is it good for all placeholders to be added to a "placeholder" collection automatically?
