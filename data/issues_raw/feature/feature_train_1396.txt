Throw out exception to python when errors happen in c++ code

Required information is after the description.
Hi tensorflow team,
I have enjoyed using tensorflow much. Thanks for the commitment to make this happen.
After writing many code based on it, I found it is very inconvenient that when the C++ code meets an error, it just breaks instead of passing the error to the python front end, so it is impossible to deal with the error gracefully.
For example, when training a network with a large learning rate with ReLU without BN, the activations could easily go out of range. As this is unavoidable since learning rate has to be tuned. It would be great to catch the out of range error in python, so things could be logged and shut down properly, instead of just break.
A log could be
W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:1102] 0x33ea350 Compute status: Out of range: Nan in summary histogram for: maxout-relu-cifar10/conv2/HistogramSummary_2

Hope this suggestion could be taken into consideration.
