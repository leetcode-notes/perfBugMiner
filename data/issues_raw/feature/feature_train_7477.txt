Add support for custom queue runners

I have a custom implementation of QueueRunner but right now TF complains when serializing:

WARNING - tensorflow - Error encountered when serializing queue_runners.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
unbound method to_proto() must be called with QueueRunner instance as first argument (got IteratorRunner instance instead)

The use case for the implementation is to take advantage of automatic thread starting from Experiment, Supervisor, managed_session, etc.
I could inherit from QueueRunner but a QueueRunnerBase would be ideal as much of the existing implementation assumes the use of enqueue_ops.
As an example, I have GeneratorRunner which runs a generator in a thread and enqueues the outputs. This is more flexible than the existing QueueRunner since it  supports placeholders with feed dictionaries.
