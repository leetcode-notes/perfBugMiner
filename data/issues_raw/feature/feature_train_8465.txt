Description
Most image ops work on batches of images, so it'd make sense if tf.image.non_max_suppression worked on batches of bounding-boxes , returning batches of selected indices.
Although I'm not completely sure how it'd work with the variable result lengths that are likely to happen in this case, perhaps masking or padding them? There's already the max_output_size parameter.
And I'm not entirely sure how well it'd work with gather (gather_nd?), since if it doesn't work well with those, this change wouldn't be as useful
