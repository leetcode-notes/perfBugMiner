ScatterSub on GPU

I tried running a CNN with embedding layer on a GPU (AWS), but ran into the same problem as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33624048/fail-to-run-word-embedding-example-in-tensorflow-tutorial-with-gpus
ScatterSub doesn't seem to be supported on GPUs and the device placement fails. It would be great if was :)
It would be great if the examples worked on GPUs.
