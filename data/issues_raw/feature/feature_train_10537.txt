tf.layers: Add weights, biases and activations to the respective collections

For generating weight, bias and activation summaries one needs to have access to these tensors. Similar to how regularization losses are added to the GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES collection, it would make sense to add weights, biases and activations to the collections GraphKeys.WEIGHTS, GraphKeys.BIASES and GraphKeys.ACTIVATIONS. Right now, layers only add the weights and bias tensors to GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES.
The summarization of the these collections is already supported here.
