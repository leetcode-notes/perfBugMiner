Generic swig rules

Looking into integrating Swig into our Bazel build all I could find was Tensorflows usage.
Is there any reason parts like _py_wrap_cc have not been extracted to a more general script?
Would tensorflow be willing to use such a thirdparty script should it get extracted/provided (into another github project perhaps)?
