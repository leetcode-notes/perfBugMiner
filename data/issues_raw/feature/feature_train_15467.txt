some proposal about  tf.metrics

Have I written custom code  :  YES
OS Platform and Distribution  -Win10
TensorFlow installed from - pip3
TensorFlow version-1.4
Bazel version
CUDA/cuDNN version-8.0
GPU model and memory-2GB
Exact command to reproduce
Describe the problem
I want to know true-positive,ture-nagetive,false-positive,false-nagetive,recall,precision for each class.
Although I can implement it at this version(1.40), it need lots of code. I mean the functions don't
support the multi-class well, it just for the 2 class condition. I think if I can implement them with few
code, it looks more elegant.
