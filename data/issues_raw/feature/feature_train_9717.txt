feature request: support placeholder for parameter k in tf.nn.in_top_k

Currently tf.nn.in_top_k requires an int as k, while tf.nn.top_k does support a 0-D int32 Tensor as parameter k. This is kind of inconsistent and inconvenient.
Is it possible to allow k to be a 0-D int32 Tensor in tf.nn.in_top_k?
