Feature Request: Dense to Sparse and Dense to Sparse Tensor Ops

I think it would be helpful if there is a dense_to_sparse op in Tensorflow for ops like ctc_loss that requires sparse labels. I'm not really sure where else it can be used aside from that but in case only ctc_loss uses it, I think it would help if dense labels can be passed into ctc_loss and do the conversion within.
