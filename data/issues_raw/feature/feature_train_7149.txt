[Java][Feature] Generating operation methods used to build a graph

As suggested in https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/language_bindings, the list of operation methods for building a graph should be generated dynamically from the list exposed by the core, using preferably protobuf.
Is anyone already working on that feature? If not, I'm tempted to try it. I was thinking of generating a builder hierarchy that allows to optionally set an argument after adding an operation. For example
GraphBuider
    .matMul(a, b)
        .withTransposeB(true)
    .softmax(logits)
    ...
and the GraphBuilder classes would be generated at build time by Bazel and would make use of the already existing OperationBuilder. Since I'm new to Tensorflow, please tell me if that doesn't make any sense to you
Thanks
(p.s. as suggested by @drpngx, I've started this discussion as a seperate issue to avoid continuing the #5 saga)
