Some small problems with the RNN and seq2seq implementations

In the class AttentionCellWrapper , https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/ops/rnn_cell.py#L1116  , maybe the lstm_output should be replaced by some other token, since the wrapper is not specified for LSTM.


In the class Decoder, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/decoder.py#L90 , I think the step() method should not return an output as an instance of BasicDecoderOutput. From an object-oriented-programming view, the BasicDecoder is an inheritance of Decoder, the basic class should not have access to something designed for the inherited class, the same problem exists in the dynamic_decode method.
