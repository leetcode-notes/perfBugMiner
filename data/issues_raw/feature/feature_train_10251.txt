Support for custom input producers

This is a request for custom functions to feed examples into input pipelines. Existing ops are designed to read pre-defined formats. Although it is entirely possible to pre-process all the data beforehand, I felt like it shouldn't be necessary, especially in realtime environments. It'd be more convenient to pass TensorFlow a lambda to use to generate the batches instead of pre-processing them into TFRecords or dealing with nasty IO or using the not scalable option of python dicts.
[Please tell me if there already exists such a solution, I didn't find a way to do it.]
