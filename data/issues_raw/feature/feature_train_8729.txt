conv1d_transpose not implemented

I would like to perform a conv1d_transpose, but I canâ€™t see any implementation in tensorflow.
I guess that inserting zeros between each values and then applying a regular conv1d would do the job ?
(principle explained hereafter with conv2d_tranpose : #4306)
But I can't find a way to implement this kind of operation with tensorflow :
import numpy as np
arr = np.arange(1, 10)                 # array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
np.insert(arr, slice(1, None), 0)  # array([1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 0, 9])
Any ideas ?
Thank you
