Add bitcast op

bitcast would be the same as numpy's unwisely named view: it would turn a tensor of one POD dtype into any different POD type such that the last dimension's size is compatible, without touching the bits in any way.  Specifically,
tf.bitcast(x, dtype).shape = x.shape[:-1] + [x.shape[-1] * sizeof(x.dtype) / sizeof(dtype)]

with an error if the division isn't an exact integer.  The most useful case of bitcast is anything to uint8 or back.
