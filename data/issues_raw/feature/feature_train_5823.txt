[FEATURE REQUEST] expand decode_csv to work with whole csv files.

I'm a bit new to tensorflow, so forgive me if this exists and I just missed it, but it seems decode_csv treats csv files exclusively as a set of records, returning a 1D tensor. This makes decoding 2D samples unintuitive (I've yet to figure out how to do so without simply telling numpy to get them and throw them into a placeholder). How much work would it be to either expand the current function or add a new one that works in a similar manner to decode_png?
