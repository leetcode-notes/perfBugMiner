AdaGradOptimizer on GPU (Making word2vec tutorial runnable on GPU)

When I try running the word2vec tutorial on GPU, I get the following error:
Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: AttrValue must not have reference type value of float_ref for attr 'tensor_type

It seems that the problem is with AdaGradOptimizer: when I replace it with GradientDescentOptimizer, I can run the code (see here)
