Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
When trying to access a file on one of my private S3 buckets, I get an error message that the object does not exist (see below for source code and traceback). Using the AWS CLI downloading the object works fine(aka I'm sure I have the access rights to access the bucket). Also accessing the object in a public S3 bucket (like the one in issue #15159) works fine. I tried looking into the source code here to see if it's maybe an issue with missing or wrong environment variables concerning the AWS credentials, but I couldn't find any code checking for any credentials at all. Am I missing something simple?
Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
When running the following code
from tensorflow.python.lib.io import file_io
file_io.stat('s3://myprivatebucket/filethatexists')
I get the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
