GPU kernel for tf.random_shuffle

There doesn't seem to be a tf.random_shuffle impl for the GPU. Some of the work I do can utilize a GPU shuffle.
Running:

tf0.12RC0
CUDA8.0
CUDNN5.1
Titan X (non-pascal)

InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot assign a device to node 'RandomShuffle_8': Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:0' because no supported kernel for GPU devices is available.
	 [[Node: RandomShuffle_8 = RandomShuffle[T=DT_FLOAT, seed=87654321, seed2=703433, _device="/device:GPU:0"](transpose_16)]]
