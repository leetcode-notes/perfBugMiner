Allow tensorflow/tensorflow/workspace.bzl to customize dependencies

When including tensorflow as a dependency of a Bazel project, it requires you to take all the declared dependencies in  tensorflow/tensorflow/workspace.bzl or none of them. Some projects, like the closure_rules allow you to customize the dependencies:
https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure/blob/master/closure/repositories.bzl#L21
This allows you to use whatever versions you want for specific dependencies that may be different from what tensorflow's workspace.bzl declares.
