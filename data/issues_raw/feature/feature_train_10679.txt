recovery_wait_secs feature for tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() similar to the one present in tf.train.SessionManager()

I ran the distributed model for a small data set and for very few epochs for some test run.
The chief worker started normally and finished training (training time was less than 30 seconds) but the other workers did not start.
Below log message has been displayed in all the workers other than chief:
Waiting for model to be ready. Ready_for_local_init_op: Variables not initialized: <list_of_variables >
Then I found the reason behind this in this Stackoverflow answer.
A recover_wait_secs feature would make it easier rather handling that timeout period manually.
