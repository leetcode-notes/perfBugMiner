[Tensorboard Request]Ignoring specific subdirectories

I think this will be simple but very useful feature for Tensorboard.
What I want is the ignoring specific subdirectories.
Tensorboard load all of subdirectries and display them, but it become slower as more subfolders are added. So, I just want to ignore some directories without moving them.
There's several options to do this.

If there is special character(like #) in folder name, just ignore it.
Like git, .ignore file manage folders to ignore.
If .nolog file in the folder to ignore.(Like .nomedia file)

I think option 3 is best, because folder structure can be changed.
