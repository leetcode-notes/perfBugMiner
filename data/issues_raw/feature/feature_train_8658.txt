Saving best models instead of most recent models with tf.train.Saver.

Most of the time I want to save the best models instead of the most recent models. Doing so using tf.train.Saver requires to choose when to save a model and to delete the worst model (which might not be the oldest) "manually".
A method to save the N best models (according to some user defined value) would be nice.
