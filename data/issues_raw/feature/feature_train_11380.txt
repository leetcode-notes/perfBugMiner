Error while slicing with int64

This is similar to #11318 but with a slice instead of an individual index. I upgraded to the latest version using pip3 install --user --upgrade tensorflow-gpu.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> tf.__version__
'1.2.1'
>>> i = tf.constant(1, dtype=tf.int64)
>>> a[i:i+1]
<long stack trace>
TypeError: Input 'strides' of 'StridedSlice' Op has type int32 that does not match type int64 of argument 'begin'.
