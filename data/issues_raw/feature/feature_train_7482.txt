Feature request: enable modification of data in tfrecord files

It would be nice to be able to append or remove samples to or from an existing set of samples saved in a tfrecords file. Otherwise the file has to be duplicated, which is unpractical for datasets >> 1TB.
Formulated in a more generalized way, this can also be seen as splitting and concatenating tfrecord files.
