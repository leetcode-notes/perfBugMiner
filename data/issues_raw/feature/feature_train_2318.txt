tf.constant should support pandas Series and DataFrame as input

Currently, it does not.
I would suggest implementing this by checking for a __array__ method, which is the standard API used for indicating that an object is coercible into NumPy arrays, and is implemented by nearly every library that implements "array like" objects in the Python ecosystem. This includes pandas, as well as many other widely used libraries, including xarray and dask.array.
