Extend tf.unsorted_segment_sum to allow 'rejecting' entries

As already discussed in #466, it would be useful to be able to mark entries which are not to be summed anywhere by assigning negative indexes (or just -1) there. @girving suggested, that this behavior should only be enabled when setting a flag (e. g. drop_negatives) to preserve the existing error detection behavior, which I support.
