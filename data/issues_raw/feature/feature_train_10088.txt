Surfacing REGISTER_OP to the public C API

Feature Request
I am working on the .NET bindings for C# and as part of this process, I am replicating the C API test suite in C# to ensure everything works as expected.
The REGISTER_OP capability is available to C developers, and I would like to have this capability surfaced so my binding (and likely other bindings) can roll out these tests as well.
This is what I would like to be able to do from C#:
