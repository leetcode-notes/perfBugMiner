Is it possible to plot two scalar summary in one plot?

Hi,
I have spent some time writing scripts to do stat in Caffe and this let me know Tensorboard is so amazing! It is actually one of the major reasons that makes me switch to tensorflow quickly.
I just wonder could an option be added to plot more than two scalars in the same plot? More specifically. it could allow:

training loss and test loss being plotted together
regularization loss and top level loss to be plotted together.
maybe adding accuracy on the right vertical axis

Just name a few. This would help a lot.
