Need better error message for error in checkpoint loading

Hi, I'm loading a previously-built model using the tf.train.Saver and running into an error: tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow.StatusNotOK: Internal: Unable to get element from the feed..
I'm not quite sure what this is referring to as I can load other models just fine. This one also builds and runs as expected. It's only after, when retrieving it again, do I get this error. The ckpt file also points to the correct locations and is reading from the right place.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bridge.py", line 518, in <module>
    tf.app.run()
  ...
  File "bridge.py", line 375, in train
    saver.restore(sess, checkpoint)

Thoughts?
