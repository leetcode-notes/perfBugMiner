gRPC debug URL scheme support for Windows

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes (See below)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6.0
Python version: 3.6.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: See below

Describe the problem
Incidentally, this is both a bug report and a feature request.
To reproduce the bug, run the following:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python import debug as tf_debug

session = tf.Session()
session = tf_debug.TensorBoardDebugWrapperSession(session, "localhost:9898")

current_epoch = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False, name='current_epoch')
increment_epoch = tf.assign(current_epoch, current_epoch + 1)

start_epoch = current_epoch.eval(session)
print("start_epoch:", start_epoch)
for cur_epoch in range(start_epoch, 10):
    session.run(increment_epoch)

The following is the output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/workspace/test.py", line 12, in <module>
    for cur_epoch in range(start_epoch, 10):
TypeError: 'UnimplementedError' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
start_epoch: grpc:// debug URL scheme is not implemented on Windows yet.

It's clear that the error is being assigned to a variable instead of being raised. Furthermore, the behavior is only present when evaluating a variable; this is unexpected, as it has nothing to do with the session itself.
I came across this while trying to enable debugging via TensorBoard. After some digging, it appears that the error message originates from TensorFlow core code, so that's why this issue is here and not in the TensorBoard project. Is there any status on implementation of this feature? If not, could there be a log warning or some sort of feedback to reflect this? The TensorBoard modal at http://localhost:6006/#debugger gives no indication that it is platform-dependent.
