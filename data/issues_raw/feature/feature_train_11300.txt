State of GPU support for commercial Android devices

Question has been asked in  this thread but got no answer. Just curious what's the plans of TF team to support Android GPUs (or no plan at all) for commercial devices such as Nexus. I understand OpenCL is not included in Android now, but we still have RenderScript. And some work has already been put to this end.
It would be great to know it from TF developers.
