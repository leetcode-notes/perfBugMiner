Add data dynamically to pre-exisiting contrib.data.dataset

(As far as I'm aware this isn't possible, so I think this is a feature request)
It would be great to be able to add data to a pre-exisiting dataset object, which already has an iterator attached. For example, in reinforcement learning, one often collects data while exploring, and needs to add this data to the training dataset. I can't see how using the concatenate() function is sufficient, as this returns a new dataset object and would require a new iterator etc.
