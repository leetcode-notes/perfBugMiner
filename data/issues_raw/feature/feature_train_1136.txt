Support for 1D convolutions

There is no conv1d method and it would be very welcome.
Or is conv2d implemented in such a way that (h=1, w, channels) would work with no issues and no compute penalties?
It might even be a good idea to implement an arbitrary convxd function, there are instances where high dimensional inputs have spatial relevance.
