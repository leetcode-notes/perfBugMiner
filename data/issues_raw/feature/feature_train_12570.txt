No gradient for `cdf`, `sample` and other functions for several distributions in `tf.distributions`

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0 cuDNN 6
GPU model and memory: nVIDIA K2100M, 2G
Exact command to reproduce: See below
dist_par = tf.Variable(1.0)
dist = tf.distributions.Beta(dist_par,1.0)
print(tf.gradients(dist.cdf(0.5), dist_par))



[None]


The output says there is no gradient.
Describe the problem
For several distributions such as Beta and Gamma, there is no gradient of their functions such as cdf, log_cdf, sample with respect to the parameters of these distributions. While gradients are provided for these functions of distributions such as Normal and Laplace.
I think theoretically the gradients should exist. And they are useful when people build a model in which samples drawn from these distributions as prior distributions are marginalized while the parameters of these distributions are optimized. It would be nice if they can be implemented
Thanks!
