Feature: Ability to restart, reopen or reset a queue.

Taking into account what @mrry said on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39204335/can-a-tensorflow-queue-be-reopened-after-it-is-closed/39209186#39209186 ;
It's not possible to reset a queue unless you have multiple sessions. How about resetting it when you have a single session?
Use case:
In a single session, if one would want to run exactly one epoch (where epoch_size%batch_size!=0) of a model x times and report it's result exactly after one full and single epoch. It would be convenient if one could restart the queues.
