tensorflow new feature request: tf.regex_match

The new tf.regex_replace feature in tensorflow 1.7.0 works fine for modifying data and returning tf.string. However to filter a dataset, a separate method is needed in order to return tf.bool for use in tf.dataset.filter
I would like to be able to filter blank lines, or lines with only whitespace from a dataset, like:
dataset = dataset.filter(lambda line: tf.regex_match(line, "^\s*$"))
Currently, I can do this using tf.py_func, see details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49654187/tensorflow-removing-blank-lines-in-dataset
