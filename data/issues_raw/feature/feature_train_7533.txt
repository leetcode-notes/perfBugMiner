Feature Request: Loading images from a URL

What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
I couldn't find a solution for this, so I made a stackoverflow answer:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42218771/how-do-i-load-images-from-urls-into-tensorflow?noredirect=1#comment71642082_42218771
Environment info
Operating System:
macOS Sierra 10.12
If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
Here is a gist of me loading images via URL, saving to disk, and processing it. To reproduce, skip the saving to disk part and send the jpeg image directly into tensorflow's sess.run. It will fail since it is not the type it is expecting.
What other attempted solutions have you tried?
I've tried downloading image, saving to disk, and using that. This however is very slow.
Is there a way to do something like this? If not, I would like this to be a feature request.
