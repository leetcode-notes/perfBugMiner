Tensorboard feature request - Text summary

Would it be reasonable to add a basic text summary feature to Tensorboard? Personally I've run my network a few dozen times with really minor changes between them for testing and it would be really useful if there was a field where I could put some arbitrary text where I just wrote the key differences in my runs.
For example, on the Events page (or somewhere else) there would be a dropdown, similar to the summaries on the Events and Histograms page, with text I added (either hardcoded or as a script argument) that says what I did differently this run. Maybe I would print out the argument values for each run as well, that would be pretty useful, but basically something where I can say "What did I do with this run again? Why was it different than the one before? Oh yeah I changed the batch size" or "Oh yeah I used my other dataset instead."
Obviously if it's arbitrary text you could maybe use it to write up a description of the network or whatever you want.
