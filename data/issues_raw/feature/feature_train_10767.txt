[Feature Request] Exclude ties in function in_top_k

This is a feature request related to #10489 (tie handling in function in_top_k)
Would it be possible to add an option/argument specifying whether ties should be included or excluded?
In other words, make it possible for ties to return False instead of True.
Thanks!
