Allow tf.Estimator.evaluate() to return summary protos / add tooling to produce useful eval image summaries

Related to #14042.
tf.Estimator.train() writes a summary of all defined summaries (scalar, img) in the given model_fn when calling MonitoredTrainingSession (here).
tf.Estimator.evaluate() does not write summaries defined somewhere in the model_fn. A workaround is defining SummarySaverHook inside the model_fn, which I think is not ideal since the Estimator has all the relevant information for saving summaries (steps, save directory, etc.).
A possible solution would be adding a SummarySaverHook during evaluation, (e.g. here) or create a new function MonitoredEvaluationSession() in monitored_session.py that creates such a hook.
