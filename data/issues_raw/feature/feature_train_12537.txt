Printing lines without logging prefix using tf.Print()

Right now, all messages printed via tf.Print() are prefixed by:
<timestamp>: I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79]

It would be useful to have a way to print user-friendly output from within the graph. Therefore, suggest adding a parameter for the logging format to tf.Print(), or at least adding a flag that disables the logging prefix.
