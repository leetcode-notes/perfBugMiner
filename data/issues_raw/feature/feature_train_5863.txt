Feature request: before throwing OutOfRangeError, dequeue the rest samples from a queue

When using a FIFOQueue as the input for a pipeline, we often encounter the case that epoch_size % batch_size == M where M != 0. It will lead the following issue:
if we would like to evaluate our model with the entire validation dataset, we cannot test the last M samples before getting the exception OutOfRangeError if we set num_epoches to 1. Even if we set num_epoches to None to avoid OutOfRangeError, we cannot exactly get the result because of the indivisibility issue.
So what I can think of is, we need a feature like this:

if num_epoches is set to None, we need to dequeue the rest M samples from the queue before every epoch is finished. For example, a dataset's size is 10, saying they are [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j], and batch_size is 3, the size of dequeued samples would be [a,b,c], [d,e,f], [g,h,i], [j], [a,b,c], ...;
if num_epoches is set to 1, we need to dequeue the rest M samples from the queue before throwing OutOfRangeError.For the above example, the result would be [a,b,c], [d,e,f], [g,h,i], [j], OutOfRangeError.
