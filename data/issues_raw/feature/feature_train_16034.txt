Feature request: tf.nn.dropout noise_shape should support unspecified dimensions

It would be nice if the noise_shape in tf.nn.dropout would support unspecified dimensions, and just use the shape of the input tensor, e.g. -1 or None. This way it could be specified as noise_shape = [-1, 1, 1, -1] instead of noise_shape = [k, 1, 1, n].
