Planning Ticket  CUDA 9.2 + cuDNN 7.1

CUDA 9.2 is almost GA (I jumped the gun).  The goal is for CUDA 9.2 and cuDNN 7.1 to be the default for TF 1.9, and when it is officially GA will impact where it lands.  This will require a device driver update, which is why we skipped CUDA 9.1.  I will update this top post as the work progresses, I am going to share some perf numbers this time around as well for a couple of the tests.
FYI: NVIDIA has already committed some code to add improvements to TensorFlow for CUDA 9.2 and it should compile just fine.  I am just starting and prefer not to say anything I have not done personally.
If you have questions feel free to ask, including if there are specific ops you want supported and why.  NVIDIA often adds support for ops for specific people, supporting all of the new operations is not something we normally do.
