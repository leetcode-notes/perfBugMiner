Feature request: let tf.layers.batch_normalization normalize over multiple axes

When using tf.nn.batch_normalization and tf.nn.moments it's possible to choose which axes are aggregated and thus which dimensions are normalized. For tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm and tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm the assumption is that only one dimension is normalized. There are use cases where it would be nice to independently normalize across both width and filters (for example audio spectrograms, where "width" could be seen as the time axis). Could the layers API be changed to be as flexible as tf.nn.batch_normalization?
