Feature Request : PathNorm and PathSGD

PathSGD was introduced in this paper. Is there existing support for this? If not, this is a feature request for:

PathNorm computation (Equation 5 in the paper)
PathSGD using the PathNorm

For the first part, the interface can be to provide a function path_norm(a, b, p=2) where a and b are tensors, p is a scalar. The function returns the p-PathNorm for the "path" between the tensors a and b (assuming that b depends on a and some weights. If not, there can be an exception or simply return 0).
