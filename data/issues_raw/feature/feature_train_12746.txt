Feature Request: Loading weights for layers defined in tf.layers api

Let's say I define a layer using the tf.layers API as shown below:
conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(input_img, filters=32, 
                                     kernel_size=(3,3), 
                                     padding='same', 
                                     name='Conv1')

Now I can build a whole network defining such layers. Can you please introduce another functionality for the tf.layers api so that for each layer we can set the weights in a single line like this:
conv1.set_weights(weights) or something like this conv1.set_params(param_values)
This would be very very useful.
