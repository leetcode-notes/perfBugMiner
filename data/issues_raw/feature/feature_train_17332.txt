Feature request: fft support for complex128

Tensorflow fft only supports complex64 types at the moment. I have a physics application that could make great use of tensorflow's architecture, which is not machine learning related but needs greater precision.
Since pyculib supports complex128, it should be available from nvidia.
Is there support planned in the future?
