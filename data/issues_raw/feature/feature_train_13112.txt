Feature Request: API for weights values conversion

It would be very nice if the TensorFlow developers can provide a simple API for converting the weight values, ported from other frameworks like Theano, Torch, Caffe and Chainer. A lot of researchers still use these frameworks. Most of the times when an individual convert weights values, obtained from some framework other than TF, the results are not reproducible which is not desirable. Providing such an API, can help the TF community to port the models from other frameworks to TF, proving that the same thing could have been done more easily in TF. The API can have a method that takes the following signature:
def port_weights_to_tf(weights values, framework=[Caffe or theano or Torch or chainer]):
       # Change the weight values for each layer and store in hdf5 with layer names
       return modified_weights
