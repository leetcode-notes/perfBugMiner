tf.gradients like functionality in the C and C++ API

Currently gradients can only be computed manually in C++ or automatically in Python with tf.gradients. Work on registering C++ implemented gradients for all the OPs has started. However, there is currently no easy way to automatically use those gradients to generate a graph. The C-api also does not have gradient creation calls yet.
This supercedes the gradient part of #476, since the rest of #476's issue was addressed.
