Beam Search Decoder API

@ebrevdo Why is it that the user needs to call tile_batch explicitly for beam search decoders when using attention models? Couldn't the beam search decoder internally tile the provided initial_state in its constructor? It seems that this API is prone to wrong usage so I'm trying to understand why it's necessary.
Thank you!
