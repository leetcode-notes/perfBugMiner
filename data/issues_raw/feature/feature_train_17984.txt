Tensorflow Lite not support Siamese network with parameter sharing

Hi,
I found that the Tensorflow Lite did not support Siamese network with parameter sharing of conv2d layers and batch normalization layers yet. (e.g. EnsureBiasVectors will fail to deal with different names of conv output layer with the same kernel.) Is there any plan to support it?
Thanks.
