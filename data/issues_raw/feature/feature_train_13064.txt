Variance update in tf.contrib.layer.batch_norm

Hi,
In the current implementation of batch norm, the variance to be used for update to moving variance is computed by centering the data around the current mean. The more proper way would be to compute the variance around the moving mean. With the current method, the moving variance will depend upon the batch size. With the updated method, the batch size will have less influence on the moving variance.
Thanks,
Mayank
