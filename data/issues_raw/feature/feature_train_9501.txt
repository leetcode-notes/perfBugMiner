Securing Tensorflow models on Android

Describe the problem
I am using android to deploy my Tensorflow model. I am obfuscating names already but that wont stop people stealing and just plugging and playing graph file in their apps. Feature request for accepting encrypted graph files to prevent our graph files from leaking or any pointers on how to implement it.
