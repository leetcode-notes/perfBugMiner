Packaged TensorFlow C++ library for bazel-independent use

Currently, building a C++ application in tensorflow requires creating a project in the tensorflow source tree and compiling with bazel. In my case I would like to use tensorflow in a (fairly large) existing application with an existing build system that would be difficult to port to bazel. The solution to me seems to be exposing tensorflow as a library that can be linked with.
