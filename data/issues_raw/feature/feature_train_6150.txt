summary name of the new `summary` module

With the new tf.summary module, the name shown in tensorboard has to be equal to the summary op in the graph.
As a result, the name shown in tensorboard cannot be the same as any existing op in the graph.
This can create a bit of problem. Before this change, I could have some op named loss and the summary of its output also named loss, which is very consistent and easy to play with -- I can just look for the name of the tensor in tensorboard.
Now it looks like I have to add a prefix/suffix to everything because they cannot use the same name. Otherwise I got loss_1 in tensorboard which is confusing especially to new users.
Is there some changes that could be done to the new summary module that keeps the nice old feature?
