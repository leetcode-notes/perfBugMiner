Add network address check in clusterSpec

Today, I got an error when starting a distributed TensorFlow computation. I debugged for hours and finally found the problem is that TensorFlow doesn't have network address check in ClusterSpec method. And it endlessly connect the illegal network address 100.xxx.xxx.232.:2223, because there is a redundant . after 232.
