Allow user to control amount of GPU memory consumed

Environment:
~tensorflow 0.10
~NVIDIA K80 GPU server.
~ubuntu 14.04
I do not change the code which is download from this repository.
When I run ptb_word_lm.py, it takes up all my GPU memory (from device gpu:0 to device gpu:15). Is it a bug? How could I fix it?
Thanks a lot in advance!
