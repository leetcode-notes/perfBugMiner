[feature] Option to Selectively Disable Certain Graph Optimizations

repost from: 999b794#commitcomment-22789669 (CC @petewarden).
On iOS when using a graph that has been "memory mapped", you want to disable constant folding to prevent the optimization pass from copying all of the weight data. The current way to do so is to set optimization level L0 which disables all optimizations. Ideally there is a way to keep Common subexpression elimination and function inlining, but prevent constant folding.
