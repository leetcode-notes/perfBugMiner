bazel version check should be in tf_workspace()

@ic suggested in #4458 to have ./configure check the Bazel version. This would probably save time for a lot of people. It should be relatively straightforward to implement, because even if Bazel is compiled from git, it still displays a version tag.
$ bazel version

@martinwicke what version do we currently support? Bazel â‰¥0.3.1?
