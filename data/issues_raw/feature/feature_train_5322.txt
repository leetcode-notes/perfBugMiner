Remove unnecessary GCS customized python code

We have a GCS-like file system (blob store) and added the support without any customized python code (event summary input for tensorboard is not needed either).
It's better to clean them up. At least, refactor and clean up the following code because wen shouldn't change any python code when we adding a new file system:
    if (io_wrapper.IsGCSPath(specification) or                                  
        specification.startswith('hdfs://')): 
I can contribute if no one is working on this.
