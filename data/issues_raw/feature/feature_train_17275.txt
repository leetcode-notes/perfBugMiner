Feature request: tf.gather with multidimensional axis

As the title says, I would like to gather multiple dimensions in the tf.gather function. An example situation would be:
a = tf.random_normal([2,3,4])
b = tf.gather(a, [[0, 0], [1, 0]], axis=[1,2])
assert b[:, 0] == a[:, 0, 0]
assert b[:, 1] == a[:, 1, 0]
When a dimension in axis is not listed, the function will gather all the entries in that dimension, as shown above. Is this possible?
