Pylint `disable` should be followed by `enable`

There is a problem, which might have high severity:
A lot of files disable pylint messages, but don't enable them in the end -- this potentially might cause a missed warning if several files are imported, because # pylint disable is a global disable.
Here are all the files that modify the pylint related to the wildcard-import
Here is an example file that doesn't revert the modifications
There might be other wildcards that are disabled without reverting the changes
