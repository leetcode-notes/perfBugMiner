Feature request: bounds_check header in python package

I think it would be useful if "tensorflow/core/kernels/bounds_check.h" was included in the python package, so that FastBoundsCheck() can be used in a custom Op when building against the binary package.
I patched this manually by adding bounds_check.h to framework_headers in tensorflow/core/BUILD:
diff --git a/tensorflow/core/BUILD b/tensorflow/core/BUILD
index 2c936bd..44210f7 100644
--- a/tensorflow/core/BUILD

I'm not sure if this is the correct way of doing this, so I'm making a feature request instead of a pull request.
Thanks!
