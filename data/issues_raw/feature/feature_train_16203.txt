Feature Request: Add CheckpointSaverListener to tf.contrib.learn.Experiment

Hello,
I'm using the tf.contrib.learn.Experiment system to manage experiments built using the tf.Estimator framework. This setup allows me to specify checkpoint saving frequencies very easily, using just the min_eval_frequency argument to tf.contrib.learn.Experiment. However, I would like to be able to add a tf.train.CheckpointSaverListener (for example, to upload files to AWS after each checkpoint). Can there be a param added to tf.contrib.learn.Experiment to pass an optional CheckpointSaverListener object, which is then passed to the underlying CheckpointSaverHook object?
Thanks!
