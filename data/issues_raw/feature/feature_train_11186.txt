tf.copy() as alternative to tf.identity()

tf.identity(tensor) does or does not create a copy of the tensor based on whether it's on the same device. This can lead to bugs that are hard to find. The current way of ensuring a copy is to perform an arithmetic/logic operation that doesn't change the value, such as tensor + 0, 1 * tensor, or tf.equal(tensor, True). Needless to say, this makes code hard to read. Moreover, different treatment is needed for different tensor types. Can we have a tf.copy(tensor) that does this for us?
