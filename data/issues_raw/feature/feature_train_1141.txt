support different horizontal axises for different scalar summaries

Is it possible to have different horizontal axises for different scalar summaries?
For example, I want to have a scalar summary of loss for each global step, and a scalar summary of network outputs for each epoch.
Currently, I have the same horizontal axis showing the global step for both like the following image.
Is it possible to have the global step (0 ... 8.0k) for loss and the epoch (0 ... 2.0k) for output_[0,0]?

If I set the epoch for output_[0,0], I get this:
