feature request: softmax target axes / multi-dimensional softmax

The current softmax implementation operates only on 2d tensors, and computes the normalization over the second dimension.
It would be useful to have a softmax operation that can sum over arbitrary dimensions in the same way that the reduce_* operations do.
As a concrete example application, one might have a convolutional network that outputs a (soft) 1-of-k prediction for each position.
