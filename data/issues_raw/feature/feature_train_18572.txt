Feeding variable length list data (from csv) to an 'indicator_column' feature

I have a feature as follows:
tf.feature_column.indicator_column(tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file(...))
Corresponding 'vocabulary_file' contains integer values as follows:
10
20
32
44
5
1212
...
Consider such training examples:
Jack, M, 22, "[10, 20]", 2.33, 1
Sara, F, 24, "[32, 44, 5, 1212]", 5.6, -1
Each training example has a variable length list data like [10, 20] or [32, 44, 5, 1212]
Now, I want to capture this data from csv file into the 'indicator_column' feature and then feed the multi-hot representation (result) to a deep model.
The decode_csv function only support float32, float64, int32, int64, string and I have issue for 'list' type data in csv.
