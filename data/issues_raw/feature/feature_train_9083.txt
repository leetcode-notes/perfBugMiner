Feature request: In tensorboard, move "Image" and "Audio" columns

A very minor feature request: it would make sense to move the Image and Audio columns to the right, and let the first columns be: Scalar, Histogram and Distribution. Those two columns are arguably not as frequently used, and switching between looking at scalars and histograms get tiring sometimes.
(but if there's plans to allow for visualising different types of variables together, that might be even better)
