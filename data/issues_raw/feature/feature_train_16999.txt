Feature Request: Add Edit Distance metric_fn to tf.metrics or Make a way to Pass Custom metric_fn outside tf.metrics

Describe the problem
I would like another metric (edit_distance) to be added into tf.metrics for label_error_rate calculation. I'm having trouble passing metric dicts for eval_metric_ops to be used by ModelFnOps that are not part of  tf.metrics.
If that isn't possible, would it be possible for us we can pass our own metric_fns that are outside tf.metrics?
Source code / logs
This is the metric dict I would like to pass as the eval_metric_ops for ModelFnOps:
metric = {"label_error_rate": tf.reduce_mean(tf.edit_distance(tf.cast(y_pred, tf.int32), y_true), name="label_error_rate")}
Where y_pred and y_true are sparse.
