Switching branches forces ./configure and bazel rebuild

Right now switching branches requires running ./configure which then makes next bazel test rebuild everything.
In particular on 32 core Xeon, switching branches/./configure makes bazel test learning/python/... run 17 minutes longer because it's building stuff from scratch. This makes it hard for open-source contributors to work on more than one Pull Request at a time.
In particular, the error from bazel test when switching git branches is as follows:
ERROR: /home/yaroslav/tensorflow.git/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/BUILD:1194:1: Executing genrule //tensorflow/core:version_info_gen failed: bash failed:\
