Describe the problem
When I divide 0/0 elements in TensorFlow, I get 0/0=NaN values. However, I want a division operator that returns 0/0=0 for these elements. Currently, I am using a workaround for this with a where operator, as can be seen in the d variable below. However, this decreases readability, is tedious when writing code with many div operators, and is probably less efficient than coding this functionality into source.
Source code / logs
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([0], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([0], dtype=tf.float32)
c = tf.divide(a, b)
d = tf.where(tf.less(a, 1e-7), a, a/b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c))
    print(sess.run(e))
