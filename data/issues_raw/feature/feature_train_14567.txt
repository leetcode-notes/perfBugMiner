Describe the problem
TensorFlow Lite is great and we can use the toco tools to convert freeze_graph. And we can specify the input and output tensors for this model.
However, we use SavedModel a lot for TensorFlow Serving. It has all the weights of the model and described the model signature in the better way.
It would be great if we can convert SavedModel file format into the final TFLite so that we don't need to export the model in many ways.
