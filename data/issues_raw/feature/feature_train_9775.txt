Feature Request: "training" argument for contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper for applying dropout depending on train/inference phase.
In tf.layers.dropout, the training parameter is a handy setting that lets you apply dropout depending on whether the model is training or doing inference. It's very convenient to be able to pass a boolean to the model placeholder and have it automatically do the right thing when it comes to dropout.
Unfortunately, tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper does not have this same parameter, and I think it would greatly benefit from it. This is a feature request for it.
I tried implementing it myself with tf.cond and either returning the dropped-out outputs/states or the untouched ones, but I couldn't figure out how to share the variables between them in the cond.
