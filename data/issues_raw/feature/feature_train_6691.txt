Feature Request: provide env vars to control resource usage (allow_growth, threads etc)

We provide GPGPU access on a cluster and to let the scheduler (HTCondor) assign the resources. Tt would be great to be able to set

the number of theads to use
the allow_growth options
and the per_process_gpu_memory_fraction option
via environment variables e.g. TF_NUM_THREADS=4, TF_ALLOW_GROW=1 etc.
