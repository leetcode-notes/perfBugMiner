Maven Packaging for GPU-backed Java Bindings

Describe the problem
Currently, the only libtensorflow_jni artifact which is deployed to Maven Central is compiled with CPU-only support. This means that (at least as far as my current understanding goes) any machine which I would like to deploy to and run GPU-backed code on has to build TensorFlow from source with GPU support. As one can imagine, this makes the logistics of such deployments much more difficult and time-consuming.
It would be wonderful if the libtensorflow_jni artifact either contained a GPU-compiled TensorFlow libraries and could use them automatically when possible or if there was a separate artifact (perhaps with a gpu artifact classifier) that contained those libraries. The former streamlines build processes at the cost of bloating the artifact a bit, while the latter at least provides an easy means of enabling GPU support for users which desire it.
I'm guessing that something like this is somewhere on the timeline (I know that the Java bindings are under active development), but I have been unable to find any documentation on the topic.
Thank you!
