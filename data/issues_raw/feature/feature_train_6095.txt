Add atan2 trigonometry function

Tensorflow has a number of built-in trigonometry functions like atan but it doesn't have atan2 yet.
This can be achieved with some custom code as pointed in this comment: #3624 (comment).
There's actually a small mistake on the first line, where np.pi should not be added. The corrected code is presented below:
def atan2(y, x):
    angle = tf.select(tf.greater(x,0.0), tf.atan(y/x), tf.zeros_like(x))
    angle = tf.select(tf.logical_and(tf.less(x,0.0),  tf.greater_equal(y,0.0)), tf.atan(y/x) + np.pi, angle)
    angle = tf.select(tf.logical_and(tf.less(x,0.0),  tf.less(y,0.0)), tf.atan(y/x) - np.pi, angle)
    angle = tf.select(tf.logical_and(tf.equal(x,0.0), tf.greater(y,0.0)), 0.5*np.pi * tf.ones_like(x), angle)
    angle = tf.select(tf.logical_and(tf.equal(x,0.0), tf.less(y,0.0)), -0.5*np.pi * tf.ones_like(x), angle)
    angle = tf.select(tf.logical_and(tf.equal(x,0.0), tf.equal(y,0.0)), np.nan * tf.zeros_like(x), angle)
    return angle
While this custom code performs reasonably well, it'd be both faster and more convenient if Tensorflow had it built-in like the other existing functions.
