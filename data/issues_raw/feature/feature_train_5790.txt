Feature proposal: bilinear upsampling transposed convolution initialization.

Hello,
I have been recently implementing the FCN-32 network for image segmentation
and found out that there is no bilinear upsampling op in Tensorflow or TF-slim.
That would be great if there will be an op that will do that, because that will make it
possible to bilinearly upsample blobs in a differentiable way or initialize upsampling
filter with bilinear kernel.
I have already implemented that and checked correctness.
You can see more if you follow the link.
If you are interested, I can make a pull request.
Thank you.
