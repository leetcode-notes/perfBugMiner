Accessing data for post-processing on the GPU without transfer to host

In TensorFlow's C++ API, after the session Run has been completed, is it possible to access the data while it's still on the GPU?
I would like to do post-processing on the GPU with the output of TensorFlow.
Currently the output is sent back to the host and I will have to move it back to the GPU for post-processing. This data transfer is something that I am looking to avoid.
