typo in tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html

https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html
"East entry in the tensor is a pixel intensity between 0 and 1, for a particular pixel in a particular image."
should probably be "Each entry...".
Sorry if this is an inappropriate forum to draw attention to this.  There was not corrections contact.
