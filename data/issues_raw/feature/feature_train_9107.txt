Tensorflow tests failing on s390x (Farmhash related)

Below tests are failing on big endian s390x platform.
The tests are failing due to farmhash doesn't support s390x platform.
We have already raised an issue  with farmhash. Test are passing after applying patch provided there.
However, we would like to know if the testcases are used  for some complex functionality of TensorFlow?
Tests:
 //tensorflow/contrib/layers:sparse_feature_cross_op_test 
 //tensorflow/contrib/learn:tensorflow_dataframe_test 
 //tensorflow/contrib/linear_optimizer:sdca_ops_test 
 //tensorflow/core:platform_fingerprint_test


Tensorflow version: v0.10.0
