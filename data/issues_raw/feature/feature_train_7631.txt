FEATURE: Tensorboard Scalars: Simple Way of Setting y axis to start at 0

I have a number of scalars that I plot in tensorboard that are non negative values (ie accuracy, etc). It would be cool if there was a quick way to have the y axis start at 0 rather than allocating unused space in the negative y direction.
