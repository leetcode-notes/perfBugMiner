SparseCrossEntropy in TensorFlow

Hey TF,
In your Translate, seq2seq example, there is a part where you require conversion from a sparse to dense matrix to do a softmax.

The comment there states that tensorflow needs a sparsecrossentropy function in order for this computation to be done on the gpu (and more efficiently overall). I was wondering: was this implementation planned to happen soon? Thanks!
