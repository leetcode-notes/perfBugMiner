Abandon gerrit and use github for everything

Gerrit review workflow is very hard to maintain and follow. A lot of project abandoned it and turns to github finally.
Really hope tensorflow will use github for all the cooperation workflow. Google Kubernetes and Docker are all excellent examples  for how to use github maintain a huge and global scale open source project successfully.
github + travis CI + slack is awesome.  Just make everything be a PR :)
