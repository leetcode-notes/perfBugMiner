Gradient for gather_nd is not implemented

Hi all,
when I use tf.gather_nd, It gives me the error "NotImplementedError: Gradient for gather_nd is not implemented".
I can temporarily solve this problem to flatten both of params and indices and then use tf.gather. But it isn't the best way to do so.
Is there any plan to support that? Thanks!
