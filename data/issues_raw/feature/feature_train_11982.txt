Feature Request: Kill session->run process

For mobile & embedded devices session->run is typically initiated through a user interaction. If the user presses the back button or continues to another screen before session->run finishes, the process is still lingering in the background wasting resources. Since these devices are relatively low powered, it would be great if we could cancel/kill the process when it's not needed anymore.
