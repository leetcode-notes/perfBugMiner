suppressing "I" log messages in tensorflow

I am using TF 0.6.0 with python 2.7.10 on both ubuntu linux and osx 10.9.5.  TF base functionality is working fine.  The issue is logging - I want to suppress the following messages that are emitted whenever I construct the first tensorflow Session:
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.cc:40] Local device intra op parallelism threads: 2
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc:58] Direct session inter op parallelism threads: 2
They do not appear to be transmitted through the normal python logging mechanism.  Any ideas?  Did I just miss something?
I don't want to turn off all log messages, I just want TF to stop generating these two specific messages - and perhaps if you can tell me how to turn off all INFO messages from this particular (seemingly non-pythonic) source, that would be fine too.
