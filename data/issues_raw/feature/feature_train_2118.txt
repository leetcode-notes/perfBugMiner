Default for tf.nn.conv2d_transpose output_shape

I am currently working with tf.nn.conv2d_transpose. From the past I am used to Caffe deconvolution layer and tf.nn.conv2d_transpose is kind of TensorFlow equivalent to it.
My question here is if someone could point me to detailed behaviour/documenatation of tf.nn.conv2d_transpose.
Particularly I am confused by output_shape parameter. My question is, why there is needed the output_shape parameter. Isn't the output shape directly come from the conv2d_transpose operation?
Based on how I understand it from Caffe and from here, computed as:
h = ((len(value[1]) - 1) * stride_h) + kernel_h - 2 * pad_h
w = ((len(value[2]) - 1) * stride_w) + kernel_w - 2 * pad_w

What happens when I set output_shape smaller than h and w? Is the new layer being cropped?
What happens when I set it higher? Is there being created padding with only zeros?
