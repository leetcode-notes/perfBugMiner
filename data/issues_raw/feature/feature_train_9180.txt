Make `py_func` accept `SparseTensor`

Describe the problem clearly
According to the doc, py_func accepts inp as a list of tensors (or convertible to tensor). However SparseTensor is not one of them. Could we support SparseTensor as well? Semantically there is no reason to treat SparseTensor differently.
Source Code / Logs
my_sparse_tensor = tf.SparseTensor(...)
tf.py_func(my_py_func, [my_sparse_tensor, ...], [tf.float32])

What I got:
TypeError: Tensors in list passed to 'input' of 'PyFunc' Op have types [<NOT CONVERTIBLE TO TENSOR>, ...] that are invalid.
