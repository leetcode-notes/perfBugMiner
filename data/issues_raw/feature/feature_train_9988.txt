[feature] Support Lanczos method in tf.image.resize_images

Add support for a Lanczos (a truncated sinc) mode in tf.image.resize_images. Currently this mode is not offered.
Pillow supports LANCZOS (aka ANTIALIAS) as a resampling method and stipulates this method has the highest quality for down sampling (default for thumbnail for example).
