Convolutional RNN/LSTM

Hi all,
This is a feature request for Convolutional RNNs such as Convolutional LSTMS. Is there any plan to support them in tensorflow?
I have an implementation working in here and some basic results indicating how well they do. I went about implementing them by making a new class called ConvRNNCell and BasicVONVLSTMCell and following what is seen in the tensorflow rnn_cell.py file. It seems I could redo the whole rnn_cell.py file like this.
If this is of interest I would be more then happy to implement it for all the rnn functions.
