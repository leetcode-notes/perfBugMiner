Tensorflow searching for outdated version of cudnn64_6.dll (Import Error)

So I tried my first install of tensorflow-gpu on Window 7x64 with a GTX1080 and was met with a DLL import error python exception that wasn't very helpful at all (that message needs to be updated to indicate what DLL it can't find!).
Anyways, I decided to attempt the import tensorflow function with proc_mon watching all the file I/O from python... Turns out, Tensorflow is searching for 'cudnn64_5.dll' ... The latest 'cudnn-8.0-windows7-x64-v6.0' installs the following dll: 'cudnn64_6.dll' ... By copying the newer DLL to the DLL name that tensorflow expects, I was able to get past this issue and run tensorflow.
Tensorflow needs to be updated to support the latest cudnn64_6 dll that NVidia provides by default.
