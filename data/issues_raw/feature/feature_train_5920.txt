Make activation function support sparse tensors

Usually, the input features need to be normalized, for example, when the feature is duration of app usage in wide and deep model. Usually you are not clear which normalization function is best for your model when you generate the features. So in the model, an activation function(for example softsign) can be applied to the input first. Currently sparse tensor is not supported. This change can be trivial.
