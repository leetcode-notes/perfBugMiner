Aspect Preserving Image Downsample That does not Require Cropping

Right now it looks like all of the image downsize (ie resize to a smaller size) operations involve either changing aspect ratio (e.g. resize_images) or cropping (e.g. resize_image_with_crop_or_pad). Compare this to the thumbnail operation in Pillow that maintains the aspect ratio but does not crop.
