Editing Tensorboard graphs

Thanks for the powerful package, equipped with an awesome tensorboard like visualization environment.
There is just one issue. Graphs generated under Tensorboard occupy too much space than necessary, which makes it difficult to understand what is going on, thanks to consequent relative reduction in font size for all the blocks. It would be really helpful if user could move the nodes around, such that rearranged view is printer friendly, and also user friendly. Please implement the feature soonest you can, as it will help newbies like me (and anyone in general, since this package too is quite new relatively) to ramp up quickly, and also for debugging the code. Thank you.
