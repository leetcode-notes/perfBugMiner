Not all image ops accept image tensors with batch dimension

It appears that only some of the image ops (e.g. tf.image.random_saturation()) only accept single images (rank-3 tensors), while others allow batches of images (rank-4 tensors). Should this be made more consistent so that all image ops allow for higher-rank tensors? There doesn't seem to be much about this in the API documentation (some ops just say that the last dimension needs to be 3).

Exact command to reproduce:

import tensorflow as tf
images = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, None, None, 3), name='images')
# This is OK
x = tf.image.random_contrast(images, lower=0.5, upper=1.0)
# Throws an exception because `images` is rank-4
x = tf.image.random_saturation(images, lower=0.5, upper=1.0)
