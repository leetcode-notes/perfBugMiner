Implement Fast Fourier Transform ops

Hey TF,
Trying to integrate the new Unitary RNN's into tensorflow. Unfortunately, they require Fast Fourier Transform and Inverse Fast Fourier Transforms.
For efficiency this needs to be done on the GPU. On the author's code (theano), they do this by making a Theano Op, and inserting scikit's Fast Fourier and Inverse Fast Fourier Here:

How can this be done in TF? Upon completing the Unitary RNN, I plan to share it to everyone! I asked on the google groups, but didn't get a reply.
