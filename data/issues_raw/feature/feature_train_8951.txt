Using output of `tf.argmax` as index raises TypeError

Minimal example
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.argmax(a)
tf.Session().run(a[b])

This raises a TypeError
TypeError: Input 'strides' of 'StridedSlice' Op has type int32 that does not match type int64 of argument 'begin'.

The solution is to tf.cast b into a tf.int32 before using it as an index. The output of tf.argmax should be usable as an index immediately. I feel that the current state is not consistent, is there some hidden reason for this?
