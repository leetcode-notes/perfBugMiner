import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.get_variable('asdfds', shape=[10], dtype=tf.int32)
x*0.5
Prints:
Traceback (most recent call last):               
  File "a.py", line 9, in <module>               
    x*0.5                                        
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'Variable' and 'float' 

Variable with matching dtype can multiply with float, the problem here is int32 cannot multiply with float.
Since usually the dtype of some tensor is not directly written in code, this misleading message can cause confusions.
