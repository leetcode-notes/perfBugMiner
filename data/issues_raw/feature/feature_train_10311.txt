Different arg names for conv1d

System information

TensorFlow version (use command below): r1.1

Describe the problem
In latest verion, tf.nn.conv1d and tf.nn.conv2d has different arg names for filter and stride.
tf.nn.conv1d:
filters: A 3D Tensor. Must have the same type as input.
stride: An integer. The number of entries by which the filter is moved right at each step.
tf.nn.conv2d:
filter: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. A 4-D tensor of shape [filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]
strides: A list of ints. 1-D tensor of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of input. The dimension order is determined by the value of data_format, see below for details.
Should it be unified to same name?
