Use __all__ to restrict exported Python symbols to the public API

As part of semantic versioning, our public Python API is (about to be) defined as the symbols documented at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python.  This is a good definition, but it makes it easy for users to accidentally depend on the non-public API.  To fix this, we should add __all__ to our Python modules and make sure __all__ matches the documented public API exactly.
Since we already declare the public symbols via '@@' references in the module docstring, we may be able to do this programmatically.  Indeed,
__all__ = [m.group(1) for m in re.finditer(r'^@@(\w+)$', sys.modules[__name__].__doc__)]
