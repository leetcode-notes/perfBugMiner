No real code example for using the tensorboard embedding tab

I spent a long time yesterday trying to understand how to get something to show up in the embedding tab on Tensorboard. It is not very well documented, and there are no code examples except for the tiny, incomplete snippets in the tutorial. I was finally able to get something working, but I think it would be helpful for future users to have a real code tutorial. I could pretty easily write one for the MNIST example since I already have my own working. Is that something that people will want?
