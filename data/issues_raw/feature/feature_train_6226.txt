Feature request to specify substitutions in embedding_lookup for invalid indices

In the current master code, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/gather_op.cc it says that the attribute validate_indices is not supported anymore:
// We used to grab the validate_indices attribute here, but now we // always validate indices since the speed difference was only 1.5%. // TODO(irving): Remove the validate_indices attribute once we have // support for removing attrs in a backwards compatible way.
I actually do want an option to specify validate_indices as false. I am using embedding_lookup and it would be useful for out of vocabulary words that are not in the embedding matrix.
If it's not possible to support validate_indices, can you suggest a way to get all zeros (instead of an exception) for indices that are not in the embedding matrix.
