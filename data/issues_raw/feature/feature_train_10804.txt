Describe the problem
Context:
I set up an input pipeline that reads tf.train.SequenceExample. My dataset is quite unbalanced, so I used tf.contrib.training.stratified_sample to resample examples.
Problem:
tf.contrib.training.stratified_sample works well with tf.FixedLenFeature (context_features) but it raises a TypeError: Failed to convert object of type <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.sparse_tensor.SparseTensor'> to Tensor. ... when applied to tf.VarLenFeature of sequence_features.
Using tf.sparse_tensor_to_dense() is not applicable either, as it raises ValueError: All shapes must be fully defined: ...
Statement:
If it is not an intended behaviour, then I'd like to report a bug, as I don't see why tf.SparseTensor shouldn't be supported.
If tf.contrib.training.stratified_sample works as intended, then I'd like to request a feature of tf.SparseTensor support in online data resampling ops.
