Suggestions for simplifying directory structure

(version/machine agnostic)
I just want to say that after using TF for a while, I still have to fire too many brain cells to remember which directory certain files are in.
The shortest way I can say this is that I suggest placing all instructional/non-source files in the same directory, probably at the top of tensorflow so  visitors can easily find them.
Right now there are:

tensorflow[org]/models (separate repo containing pre-trained models)
tensorflow[org]/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/
-tensorflow[org]/tensorflow/tensorflow/models
tensorflow[org]/tensorflow/tensorflow/tutorials (these are Tensorflow website tutorials)
tensorflow[org]/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/how_tos

Hopefully I am not the only one that sometimes finds this confusing, probably because of the same words being used repeatedly to describe different things.
Suggestion 1 is to place the tensorflow/[examples & models] directories into the root of tensorflow[org]/tensorflow and renaming that directory to examples_tutorials, to make where to look obvious for those not digging through the source (which is probably a majority of visitors).  I think that single, simple change would simplify this directory structure quite a bit.
I have a couple of additional suggestions for renaming the tensorflow/tensorflow/models directory (note not the pre-trained repo).

Rename the separate tensorflow/models repo (that contains code pertaining to pre-trained models) to pre-trained-models or pre-trained-weights and rename the tensorflow/examples/models directory to something that conveys the fact that it contains research paper models and not pre-trained ones.
Rename models/embedding to word2vec or something else more descriptive

Happy to submit a PR or two if the team wants to make these changes.
