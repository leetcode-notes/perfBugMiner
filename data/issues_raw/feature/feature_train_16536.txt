Feature Request: global average pooling layer in tf.layers

Hello,
Can we add an implementation of global_average_pooling to tf.layers or tf.contrib.layers? It can look much like the Keras implementation here: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GlobalMaxPool3D
and essentially just requires calling tf.reduce_mean.
I suspect lots of people have written functions called global_pooling that just call reduce mean, and it would be nice to have a tf.layers function that just does this for consistency/readability.
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): AWS Deep Learning AMI (Conda)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: K80
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
