Tensorboard: Please improve log-scale plots

Hi!
Tensorboard currently (version 0.12.1) has an option to plot graphs with a logarithmic log scale, but this functionality doesn't work well whenever plotting very small values (e.g. the ones that converge to zero, like loss values). For example, compare this plot in Tensorboard:

With the exact same data plotted using matplotlib/pandas using logy=True:
runs = sorted(os.listdir('tensorboard/logs/'))[:2]
d = [pd.read_csv('http://127.0.0.1:6033/data/scalars?run=%s&tag=loss&format=csv' % r)['Value'] for r in runs]
res = pd.DataFrame(d, index=runs).T
res.plot(ax=ax, logy=True)


Clearly, the Tensorboard plot is much less informative (the "logarithmic plot" option doesn't do anything to improve the plot). It would be nice if Tensorboard could produce logarithmic plots similar to the ones in matplotlib.
