Gradients of non-scalars (higher rank Jacobians)

Currently if you call gradients(ys, xs), it will return the sum of dy/dx over all ys for each x in xs. I believe this doesn't accord with an a priori mathematical notion of the derivative of a vector. I'd like the way to take the derivative of ys wrt xs where both are vectors and have a Jacobian matrix returned. By extension, I'd like to take the derivative of a vector wrt a matrix and get back a 3-tensor. There doesn't seem to be a convenient tensorflow function to compute the Jacobian or higher order derivatives. Am I missing something or is this functionality that we could add?
