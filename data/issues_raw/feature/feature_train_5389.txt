[minor enhancement] Absolute vs. Relative import

I am raising a question if absolute imports should be changed to relative -- even if not in all the files, but at least in the files that have to be grouped together.
According to PEP 328:

... the most important [usage case ...] is being able to rearrange the structure of large packages without having to edit sub-packages. In addition, a module inside a package can't easily import itself without relative imports.

I understand that absolute imports help avoid "shadowing" of the modules/methods with the same names, but if the naming convention of the relative imports is enforced to be protected (_name), the problem could be mitigated.
