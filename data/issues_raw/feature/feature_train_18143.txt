contribute: Add the API to set the session configuration when load the model in the JAVA

System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): Master
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A

Exact command to reproduce: Run the snippet below.
In the Java, only can set the run options and can't modify the session configuration when load the model. Sometimes I want to set the session strategies, ex. Set the session threads, op threads number, and so on.
I write the code to add new interface in the JAVA, and also add the JNI corresponding method.
I have been submit the code in the github:

I will use it in my company project, I think it should not conflict the Tensorflow license, I still contribute it.
