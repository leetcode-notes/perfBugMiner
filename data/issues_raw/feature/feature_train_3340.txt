cannot save/restore contrib.learn.DNNClassifier

Hi , i been struggling some days trying to save a contrib.learn.DNNClassifier and im getting desperate can you help me? I tried everything it says in official documentation, but it sees as if the documentation isnt coherent with the API, things i have tried are:

rain.Saver() ,but got a "No variables to save" error
tried https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn this examples, created my DNNClassifier but when trying to call function save() on my classifier , it says 'DNNClassifier' object has no attribute 'save'
Tried the deprecated class TensorflowDNNClassifier and it can be saved right ,but when you try to restore it ,it says that theres no model to restore.
Tried to restore the saved TensorflowDNNClassifier with Estimator.restore() but it says that Estimator has no attribute restore.

Is there a way to save and restore a DNNClassifier? This question is asked multiple times in stackoverflow and in https://gitter.im/tensorflow/skflow
I would be very thankfull if you can help me.
