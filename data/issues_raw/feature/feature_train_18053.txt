Lowercase tf.print when print is a function?

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): n/a
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): n/a
TensorFlow version (use command below): n/a
Python version: n/a
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce: n/a

Describe the problem
Since TensorFlow must be compatible with Python 2.7, tf.Print is uppercase.  However, tf.print would work fine for Python 3 users and Python 2 users with from __future__ import print_function?  There's no difficulty adding this to the source, since all TensorFlow source files have from __future__ import print_function, and it wouldn't interfere with any other 2.7 users.
Objections to me adding?
